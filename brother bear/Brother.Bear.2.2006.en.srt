-BOTH: Whoa!

19
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,320
Look out! She's after us, eh!

20
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,920
-Oh, jeez.
-You gotta help us!

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,560
-You gotta hide us, eh.
-Oh, jeez. Too late. Here she comes!

22
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,680


23
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,920


24
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,280
I told you that was no moosette.

25
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,960
Well, she looked like one from behind.

26
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,880
What's gotten into you two?

27
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,760
-Well, it's that time of year, eh.
-Spring fever.

28
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,160
Spring what?

29
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,040
-Yeah, you know, like the birds.
-Yeah, and the bees.

30
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,440
And the moosettes. If you know what
we mean by moosettes.

31
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,680
Yeah, well, don't look now,
but your girlfriend's back.

32
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,720
 <i>Look all around you</i>

<i>Welcome to this day</i>

38
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,520
 Awesome! Let's do it again.

39
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,720


40
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,080
TUG:  Hey, Kenai.

41
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,840
-Hiya, Tug.
-Where y'all off to in such a hurry?

42
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,520
Crowberry Ridge.

43
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,080
We're gonna get dibs.

44
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,440
There's elderberries,
salmonberries, raspberries,

45
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,640
whortleberries, strawberries,
huckleberries, crowberries...

46
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,680
Hey, hey, slow down now.
That's a lot of berries.

47
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,880
Yeah, there's plenty.
You wanna come with us?

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,840
Yoo-hoo! Tug!

49
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:55,840
 Well, I'd love to, little Koda,
but can't keep the girls waiting.

50
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,600
Aw, who needs girls?

51
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,840
We're two footloose guys
out on the tundra.

52
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,520
That's right. Kenai and Koda.
We don't need anybody else.

53
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,040
Okay, but you can't run from love.

54
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,360
HOONAH: Tug!

55
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,680
It has a way of tracking you down.

56
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,440
 Hi, Hoonah.
You look mighty lovely today.

57
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,080


58
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,600
Did you see the look on Tug's face?

59
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,160
"Can't keep the girls waiting."

60
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,280
All right. How about we get some rest?

61
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,320
Rest? We've been hibernating
for six months.

62
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,280
-Who needs rest?
-Who needs rest?

63
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,080
A couple bears who are gonna beat all
the other bears to Crowberry Ridge.

64
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,600
And we're gonna get first dibs
on the berries, right?

65
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,880
Yeah, you bet.

66
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,800
-If you promise to go to sleep.
-Okay, okay.

67
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,840


68
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,080
I know all bears like berries,
but I love berries.

69
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,520
Good night, Koda.

70
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,200
Are you a berry-liker or a berry-lover?

71
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,600
Good night, Koda.

72
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,720


73
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,680
Nita!

74
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,200
Kenai!

75
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,120
Whoo! Yeah!

76
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000


77
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,760
-Race you to Hokani Falls!
-Wait up!

78
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,080


79
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,800
Here I come!

80
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,200


81
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,440


82
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,280
Nita!

83
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,680


84
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,000


85
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,680
Here.

86
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,360
We're always gonna be
best friends, huh?

87
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,720
Huh?

88
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,760
BOTH: Wow.

89
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,480
MAN: Nita, time to go!

90
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,120
Goodbye, Kenai.

91
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,480


92
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,680
See you!

93
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,720
Bye, Nita!

94
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,080
Bye, Nita. 

95
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,680


96
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,000
Bye, Nita. Uh?

97
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,880
KODA: So, who's Nita?

98
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,040
Huh? What?

99
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,520
Did you know you talk in your sleep?
You were going, "Nita! Nita!"

100
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,720
So who's Nita?

101
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,320
She's a girl I used to know.

102
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,360
Whatever happened to her?

103
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,720
I don't know. I guess she grew up.

104
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,600
He's here! He's here!

105
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,480
-The groom is here!
-We must hurry. Let us prepare.

106
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,640
GIRL: Hurry up! I wanna see him.
I wanna see Atka.

107
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,560
BOY: Nita, he's here!

108
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,120
They're here.
Prepare for the ceremonies.

109
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,840
He must have brought
his entire village with him.

110
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,320
Well, my sweet, this marriage
is extremely important.

111
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,600
That's why we came
to help you get ready.

112
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,920
Oh, no, no. That's okay.
I can get myself ready.

113
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,560
Ah, go ahead. Use all the water.

114
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,000
Then we'll just air dry your hair.

115
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,040
Air dry? Certainly not.
Towel dry is shinier.

116
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,520
You know...

117
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,280
We'll put your hair up
to show off your beautiful eyes.

118
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,520
Up? No, down, of course,
to frame that beautiful face.

119
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,520
No, we're gonna put it up
to show it off better.

120
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,600
-Down.
-Up.

121
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,720
-Down.
-Up.

122
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,280
-I'm gonna say down.
-Uh...

123
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,480
Oh, she's nervous. She needs to eat.

124
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,120
-I'll go get some smoked salmon.
-But I...

125
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,920
Salmon? On a nervous stomach?

126
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,600
She needs hackberry root
steeped in rainwater.

127
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,720
In the morning? No!

128
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,520
No, no, I'm fine.

129
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,640
I think I'll feel better when I'm dressed.

130
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,320
BOTH: Dressed?
I have just the outfit for you.

131
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,760
Oh, but you don't understand.
I already have one picked out.

132
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,280
Simple reindeer hide.
Slimming, yet elegant.

133
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,360
No, caribou. Feathers. Lots of beads.

134
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,320
-Beads? Are you nuts?
-Reindeer for a wedding?

135
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,080
-No more beads.
-Seashells, then.

136
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,160
-What is it with you and your seashells?
-I love seashells!

137
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,280
Hey!

138
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,000
I do believe I am feeling a bit hungry.

139
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,240
-I'll get the salmon.
-I'll get the tea.

140
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,160
Okay. Get plenty of both.

141
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,680


142
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:39,680
You look as beautiful in that dress
as your mother did on our wedding day.

143
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,200
Thanks, Daddy.

144
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,680
I wanted to wear
something of hers today.

145
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,400
Oh, that means so much to me.
Your mother would be so proud.

146
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,960
I wish she was here.

147
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,200
Oh, she is.

148
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,720
In here.

149
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,840
Once you love someone,
they stay in your heart forever.

150
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,280


151
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,400
Are you ready to meet Atka?

152
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,960


153
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,680
WOMAN: Psst.

154
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,360
-Hmm?
-Mmm-hmm.

155
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,800


156
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,480
Great spirits, we come before you today

157
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,920
to bond this man
and this woman as one.

158
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,360
We pray this pleases you.

159
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,800


160
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,440


161
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,760


162
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,960
MAN: Watch out!

163
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,040
Nita!

164
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,680
The spirits are trying
to tell us something.

165
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,720
WOMAN: It must be a sign.

166
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,200
 I don't understand.
How could this happen?

167
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,920
The villagers say it's a sign.

168
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,400
The villagers?
What the heck do they know?

169
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,280
Do you want the advice
of the villagers or a professional?

170
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,680
Oh, no, definitely a professional.

171
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,160
They say that in all the tribes,
you are the wisest shaman.

172
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,720
Sha-woman, okay?

173
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,560
"Wise" and "man" don't even belong
in the same sentence.

174
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,240
Let's get down to business.

175
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,400
So the ice cracked
right out from under you.

176
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,840
Sure you haven't put on a few pounds?
Come on, girl to girl.

177
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,400
No, my weight's been constant.

178
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,000
Well, lucky you, Miss Constant Weight.

179
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,840
Tell you what.
Why don't we just ask the spirits, okay?

180
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,360
-Hmm.
-

181
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,160
Uh-huh. Yeah.

182
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,680
What? What are they saying?

183
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,840
Don't interrupt. It ain't all about you.

184
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,120
Uh-huh.

185
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,640
They say...

186
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,320
You can't marry Ka-ka!

187
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,640
-Atka.
-Whatever.

188
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,280
The point is, you're already
matched up, Miss Two Timer.

189
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,280
 Already matched up?
To whom?

190
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,040
To the one who gave you this.

191
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,280
Look at that picture.
That thing is crystal clear.

192
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,880
Kenai?

193
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,320
The bear boy?

194
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,720
Oh, no, no. We were just kids.

195
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,400
I've heard that one before.

196
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,200
Oh, there has to be a way to undo this.

197
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,960
Undo it?
You can't undo what's been done.

198
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,760
It's done. Case closed.
No more conversation. Ooh!

199
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,800
There is one way.

200
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:25,000
You must go and eat an ox!

201
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,080
What?

202
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,600
Oh, wait, I'm sorry.

203
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,080
It's the equinox!

204
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,080
Does this place mean anything to you?

205
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,520
Hokani Falls?

206
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,640
That's where Kenai gave me the amulet.

207
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,120
You gotta go to Hokani Falls.

208
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,360
And on the eve of the equinox,

209
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,240
when the spirits
change winter into spring,

210
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,840
you must burn the amulet

211
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,800
and send the bond
back up to the ancestors!

212
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,760
You know, you might wanna
write some of this down.

213
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,560
The equinox is only three days away.
I have to get going.

214
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,680
Uh, with the person
who gave you the amulet.

215
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,360
Kenai? But he's a bear.

216
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,320
Yeah?

217
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,280
You know, a bear?

218
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,440


219
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,840
Uh, I know what a bear is,
and I suggest you go look in the woods.

220
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,120
Well, even if I find him,
how will I talk to him?

221
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,000
Hmm. How will you talk to him?


222
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,560


223
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,040
Don't be afraid. It's in there.

224
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,240


225
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,240
That ain't it. Come on, try it again.

226
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,360


227
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,920
Ooh! I don't know what that was.
One more time.

228
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,320


229
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,480


230
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,440
KODA: And that mammoth stood there
watching the whole thing.

231
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,920
So I told Bucky, "The next time
you have to sneeze,

232
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,520
"please take the walnuts
out of your mouth first."

233
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,840
Oh, and then I started laughing so hard,
guess what came out of my nose.

234
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,960
Uh, Koda, speaking of food...

235
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,120
I know what you mean. All this walking
has made me crazy hungry.

236
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,920
 Ha-ha!

237
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,200
Hey, watch it.

238
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,520


239
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,040
Hey! Whoa!

240
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,360
All right, step aside, kid,

241
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,520
and let a real bear show you
how the digging's done.

242
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,320
Sure it's easy now.
I gave you a head start.

243
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,760
 Jackpot. All the roots
you can eat, buddy.

244
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,920
I knew I was onto something.

245
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,320
Oh, yeah, you did, huh?

246
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,760
Ah, what can I say?
I've got killer instincts.

247
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,160
Yeah, right. 

248
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,320
Oh, hey, look, is this a tuber?

249
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,320
-Get down!
- What is it?

250
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,720


251
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,120
Quick, hide in here!

252
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,080


253
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,800


254
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,240


255
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,120


256
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,200


257
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,480
Aah!

258
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,720
Ahh!

259
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,520
Nita?

260
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,200
Ow! 

261
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,520
Watch it!

262
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,640
Hey, no, Nita! It's me, Kenai.

263
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,320
Kenai?

264
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,040
Is it really you?

265
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,840
Yeah, it's really me.

266
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,200
Wow, I'd heard you were a bear,

267
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:15,400
I just didn't realize
you'd look so much like a bear.

268
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,920
Yeah, well, look at you.
You really changed.

269
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,960
Wait a minute. You can talk.
I mean, you can understand me?

270
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,480
Yeah. The spirits did it
so when I found you, I could talk to you.

271
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:31,520
Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. You...
You've been looking for me? Why?

272
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,160
Well, this is why.

273
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,920
You've kept this? After all these years.

274
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:43,240
The great spirits told our shaman
that this amulet bonds us as one.

275
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,400
Really?

276
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,680
So now you and I have to go
to Hokani Falls...

277
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,080
Together? Like when we were kids?

278
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,600
-...and burn it.
-And burn it!

279
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,120
Burn it? What?

280
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,920
It's no big deal. It's only a little trinket.

281
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,640
Little trinket?

282
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,320
Uh, well, what I mean is,
we were just silly kids.

283
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,680
They won't let me get married
until it's destroyed.

284
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,800
Hmm. Let me think about this.

285
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,400
-Sorry, can't help you.
-What?

286
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,960
So, have fun burning
the silly little trinket on your own.

287
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,680
No, you don't understand.

288
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,920
We have to burn it together.
Otherwise, it won't work.

289
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,080
KODA: What won't work?

290
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,800
Uh, Nita, this is my brother, Koda.
Koda, Nita. Nita, Koda.

291
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:25,280
So you're Nita.
Kenai was just dreaming about you.

292
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,680
-
-I was not.

293
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,600
Was too.
You should hear him. "Nita. Nita."

294
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,640
Well, it's been nice talking to you,

295
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,280
but Koda and I have big plans
to go to Crowberry Ridge.

296
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,280
Wait! You're just gonna walk away?

297
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,240
You're not gonna help me
take care of this?

298
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,320
Nope.

299
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,800
You know, neither of us can get on
with our lives until we burn this amulet.

300
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,440
I'll take my chances.

301
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,600
Okay. Fine. Fine.

302
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,080
I guess I'll just wait for them
to turn you back into a human

303
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,240
and send you to find me.

304
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,600
Would they do that?

305
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,000
No. No, buddy, of course not.

306
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,280
Well, how do you know?

307
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,000
What if they did
turn you back into a man?

308
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,160


309
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,360
Then we wouldn't be brothers anymore.

310
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,640
No, Koda, it's... That's not...

311
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,280
Hmm.

312
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:24,160
 Fine. Okay.
We'll go to Hokani Falls.

313
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,000
But right after that, buddy,
just the two of us,

314
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,920
we'll race down to Crowberry Ridge.

315
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,480
-Pinkie swear?
-Pinkie swear.

316
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,440
Then it's settled. Ready?

317
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,080
 As I'll ever be.

318
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,880
Um...

319
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,160
Hokani Falls is this way.

320
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,120
I knew that. I knew that.

321
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,200
No, he didn't.
Kenai has a lousy sense of direction.

322
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,240
KENAI: That is not true.

323
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,640
KODA: One time,
in the middle of the night,

324
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,280
he was trying
to find our cave in the dark...

325
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:58,800
Course, when we met, he didn't know
the first thing about being a bear.

326
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,240
Like this one time,
we were hunting for pine nuts,

327
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,160
and he stuck his big head
inside a hollow tree.

328
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,320
And I said, "You better not do that
'cause you don't know who lives there."

329
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,360
But he did,
'cause you can't tell Kenai nothing.

330
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,520
All right, Koda.

331
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,640
Next thing you know, he spent a whole
week smelling like a stinky skunk.

332
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,520
 Something tells me
stinky skunk was an improvement.

333
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,720
KODA: I got a lot more stinky Kenai
stories, if you want to hear them.

334
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,440
-Okay, so, like, we gotta go, eh.
-We'll see you around, eh.

335
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,200
-So, we'll give you a call.
-Yeah, we'll catch you later.

336
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,320
Yeah, we gotta go work out.

337
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,760
Yeah. Gotta keep
these muscles real buff, eh.

338
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,840
So long!

339
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,960
-Hey, look, it's big bear.
-Beauty, eh.

340
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,400
-Oh, hey, guys.
-Boy, are we glad to see you, eh.

341
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,520
Yeah, 'cause we finally found a couple
of real moosettes, eh,

342
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,280
right down there by the stream.

343
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,560
BOTH: Bye!

344
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,520
-Toodle-oo!
-So long!

345
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,120
Those guys are weird.

346
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,920
Don't look. You'll only encourage them.

347
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,800
But they won't give us
the time of day, eh.

348
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,720
We was thinking maybe you could help
us with, you know, an opening line, like,

349
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,040
"Oh, hey, I see you like to eat twigs."

350
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,040
Or how about a sonnet, eh?

351
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,760
Like, "Shall I compare thee
to a summer's dew?"

352
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,160
Oh, jeez. Forget that brainy stuff, eh.
They're not owls.

353
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,720
I like, "Hey ladies, nice dewlaps.
Are those things real?"

354
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,880
NITA: Excuse me.

355
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,560
-Uh-oh. Oh, gee.
-Hunter. Hunter!

356
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,120
We're out of here! Bye!
Every moose for himself.

357
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,920
-Oh!
-

358
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,400
Act like we're not here.

359
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,480
It's okay. This is Nita.
She's with me and Kenai.

360
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,560
-She is?
-Oh.

361
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,640
-Well, pleased to meet you, eh.
-How's it going, eh?

362
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,080
I'm Rutt, and this is my brother...

363
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,200
NITA: Kenai, what's the holdup?

364
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,240
We have to set up camp
on that far peak before sundown.

365
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,760
Oh, nice to meet you.

366
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,560
Scary, isn't she?

367
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,760
Let's go. We're running out of daylight.

368
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,000
Nita, calm down. We got plenty of time.

369
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,400
A smart traveler always allows
for unexpected delays.

370
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,320
 Well, this won't be a delay
if you let me have a minute

371
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,600
to give these guys
a little romantic advice.

372
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,840


373
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,240
Romantic advice? From you?

374
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,680
Stop kidding. Let's go.

375
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,960


376
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:11,280
Hmm. You know, boys, I think this calls
for more than just a good opening line.

377
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,840
TUKE: It does?

378
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,480
Oh, yeah, yeah, of course. Ahem.

379
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:19,480
Acts of bravery.
That's what really impresses the ladies.

380
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,000
RUTT: Gee, eh, bravery sounds scary.

381
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,360
No, you just have to pretend
to be brave.

382
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,320
-Yeah?
-I'll go out there, I'll act all ferocious,

383
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,520
and then you guys come over
the beaver dam and rescue them.

384
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,040
Oh. Okay. Yeah, yeah.
That's a beauty plan.

385
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,120
-He's smart, eh. Not like you.
-Oh, get out.

386
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:40,080
Kenai, we don't have time
for this. Kenai!

387
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,720
It's no use.

388
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,800
This falls under,
"You can't tell Kenai nothing."

389
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,800


390
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,120
What's wrong with him?

391
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,560
Maybe he got ahold
of some bad salmon.

392
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,000
 This is stupid.

393
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,840


394
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,880
This ought to impress the ladies
for sure, eh.

395
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,080
Yeah.

396
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:08,320
I'm a big hungry bear,
and I'm gonna rip you to shreds! Roar!

397
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,040
I said I'm gonna rip you to shreds!

398
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,600


399
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,360
Uh-oh. Hey, I think that's our cue, eh.

400
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,600
-Yeah, beauty.
-Let's go.

401
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,320
Fear not, moosettes!

402
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,080
I, Tuke, and my brother, Rutt,
will save you, eh.

403
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,120
-Yeah!
-What ho, largish bear?

404
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,760
Touch not
those fair moosette ladies, eh.

405
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,960
You's gonna have to go
through us if you want them.

406
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,320
Yeah. You'll have to kill us, eh.

407
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,360
-What? No, no, not kill us.
-Oh, sorry.

408
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:38,680
Uh, maybe not kill us, but just,
you know, push us down or something.

409
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,040
Roar!

410
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,560


411
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,360


412
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,400
-
-

413
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,080
Jeez, that was scary, eh.

414
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,960
Jeez. I thought
I was gonna wet my hooves.

415
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,520
You can go back to grazing.
Nothing to see here.

416
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,200
-Toodle-oo!
-Hey, wait!

417
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,440
Guys, where are you going?
Don't leave.

418
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,440


419
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,680


420
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,480
-
-

421
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,040


422
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,720


423
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,920


424
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,760
-This used to be such a quiet river, eh.
-Oh, yes.

425
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,200
-Let's get out of here.
-Nice rack on that little one, though.

426
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,840
Are you kidding?
All antler and no brain.

427
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,320
That went well.

428
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,200
-
-

429
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,800
Hey, Kenai.

430
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,520
I thought you were supposed
to be scaring moose.

431
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,840
Do you think you can help me out here?

432
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,280
Do all his plans end
with his head stuck in something?

433
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,440
Most of them.

434
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,120
-KENAI: Koda!
-Well, they do.

435
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,200
Calm down, Kenai.

436
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,960
We'll try to get you out of here.

437
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,760
Okay, let's see here.

438
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,680
KENAI: Aah! Ohh!

439
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,440
Sure would be easier
if he didn't have such a fat head.

440
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,360


441
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,200
-Hi, Kenai.
-Hi, Koda.

442
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,920
Oh! Oh, no! My bag. My bag!
The amulet's in my bag!

443
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,800
It's floating right in front of you.
Just grab it!

444
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,640
-YOUNG KENAI: Nita!
-

445
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,640
You get it. I can't. I can't.

446
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,120
It's right there! Kenai, get it.

447
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,840
I'm a little busy here.

448
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,560
It's getting away, Kenai!
Help! Get it! Get it!

449
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,760
KENAI: Stop hitting...

450
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,000


451
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,120
Oh, no!

452
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,640
Oh! The amulet. Oh, there it is!

453
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,640
I guess this would qualify
as one of those unexpected delays.

454
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,920
Ah, there it is.

455
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,600
Oh, thank goodness.

456
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,960
-
-

457
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,640
Let's see what we got here.

458
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,080
Hey! Wait, that's my stuff.

459
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,360
Ooh!

460
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,080
You leave that alone. It's mine.

461
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,480


462
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,160
Ugh! Come on!

463
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,840
It's gone.

464
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,720
Ohh! The amulet is gone.

465
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:24,320
That's because there ain't a better thief
than the masked bandit.

466
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,120
Once they get something
in their clutches,

467
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,200
you might as well give up all hope.

468
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,800
Nope, that amulet's as good as gone.

469
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,880
The Ice Age will end
before you get it back.

470
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,880
Thanks a lot, Kenai.

471
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,720
-What did I do?
-This is all your fault!

472
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,800
My fault?

473
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,320
If you hadn't stopped
to help those moose...

474
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,200
Whoa, whoa! You're the one
who destroyed an entire beaver dam.

475
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:45,320
I wouldn't have destroyed it if you
hadn't gotten your head stuck in it.

476
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,640
And I'm not the one who had the bag
in reach and then let it float away.

477
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,880
My head was stuck.
What's your excuse?

478
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,760


479
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,160
Oh, what am I gonna do now?

480
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:06,120
If I can't burn the amulet,
I'll never be able to marry Atka.

481
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,560


482
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,760


483
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,120


484
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,240


485
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,800
Kenai?

486
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,360
Nita, Nita, you gotta come quick.
You're not gonna believe it.

487
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,960
Kenai spent the whole night
untangling those tracks.

488
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,240
And I didn't think anybody could,
'cause they were all forks,

489
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,120
double-backs and crisscrosses
and dead ends...

490
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,160
Koda, Koda, where is Kenai?

491
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,960
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
He found the river bandit's hideout.

492
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,800
 Show me.

493
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,600


494
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,840
 Nita, Nita, over here.

495
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,800
Well, where is it? Did you get it?

496
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,840
 Shh! I don't have it yet.

497
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:48,120
It's up in the tree.
I'm waiting for them to fall asleep.

498
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,080


499
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,160
-Nita, wait.
-Hey!

500
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,040
Nita, what are you doing?

501
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,000
I'm getting my amulet back.

502
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,520
Let me handle this.

503
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,680
I'm fine. I've got it covered.

504
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,360
No, seriously, you could fall.

505
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,640
I'm trying to concentrate.

506
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,880
-
-NITA: Whoa!

507
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,680
RACCOON: Hey, hey!

508
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,720
Can't any of you morons
define the term "nocturnal"?

509
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,520
Anyone?

510
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,360
Sorry. Sorry.

511
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,880
It's completely my fault. Just me.


512
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,240
Uh, listen, you've got something of ours.

513
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,760
Yeah, it's round, about so big.

514
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,480
Maybe I do, maybe I don't.

515
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,360
That's for me to know
and for you to find out.

516
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,680
Either way, it's a moot point.

517
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,200
Finders keepers, losers weepers.
It's the way of the woods.

518
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,160
Hey, you didn't find it,
you stole it. Thief.

519
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,720
All right, you got me. That's what we do.

520
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,760
We rob from the rich
and give to the less fortunate.

521
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,800
You know, like us.

522
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,200


523
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,000
I don't think
you wanna mess with Kenai.

524
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,280
He's a lean, mean,
raccoon butt-kicking machine.

525
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,560


526
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,080
 Ow!

527
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,400
-Ahh!
-Go ahead!

528
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,800
Hit him with all you got. He can take it.

529
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,280
Koda, what are you doing?

530
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,960
I'm tricking them into using
all their pine cones.

531
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,000
Ow! It's a pine forest.

532
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,320
Oh, right. This could take a while.

533
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,440
You think?

534
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,480
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey,
what about a trade?

535
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:30,440
Whoa, whoa! Hold your fire.
Hold it. Hold, hold. He wants to trade.

536
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,080
-RACCOONS: Ooh, a trade.
-Whatcha got?

537
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,880
 What do I got?
I got lots of things.

538
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,840
I got pine cones?

539
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,280
-
-RACCOON: No!

540
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,040
Uh, how about this stick?

541
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,600
RACCOON: No.
KENAI: Rock?

542
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,080
-RACCOON: You are insulting me.
-

543
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,080
-
-RACCOON: I can't believe it!

544
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,800
-Shoo. Shoo. Come on. 
-

545
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,960
Come on, let go.

546
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,440


547
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,840


548
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,280


549
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,920
Ohh...

550
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,800
Mama!

551
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,840
NITA: Uh...

552
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,960
Hi?

553
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,960
Nita, I think it's time to go!

554
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,120


555
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,040
Nita, behind you!

556
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,800


557
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,560
Whoa! She's not bad.

558
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,400


559
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,680


560
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,920
I got an idea. Come on.

561
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,400
Nita, go to the top.

562
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,200
What? I'm trying to get down.

563
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,640
Just listen to me! I know what I'm doing.

564
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,840
Hello!

565
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,880
I want what you took from me.

566
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,480
Yes, that's it. Keep going!

567
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,560
Let's get her.

568
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,680
Kenai! 

569
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,960
Well, well. Nowhere to run to, baby,
nowhere to hide.

570
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,880
Nita, let go!

571
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,960
What? This is your plan?

572
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,440
Just trust me.

573
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,800
Don't listen to him.

574
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,640
Come on,
be a smart little hunter girl, huh?

575
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,680
Hand over the trinket.

576
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,960
Kenai, this better work!

577
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,320
Catch me!

578
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,920


579
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,600


580
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,960


581
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,560


582
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:00,080
-That was a lot of raccoons.
-I can't believe I outran all of them.

583
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,720
-When you jumped out of that tree...
-Oh, oh! And the way you caught me!

584
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,960
And then when we fell...

585
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,800
BOTH: You were amazing!

586
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,080


587
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,480
I'm just glad we finally got
the old Nita back.

588
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,400
What do you mean, "the old Nita"?

589
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,160
The fun Nita.

590
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:19,160
Come on, you know you've been
kind of a stick in the mud this entire trip.

591
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,200
Okay, maybe you don't know.

592
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,520
It's just good to see you
loosen up a bit, you know?

593
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,160
Now hold on.

594
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,240
Ew! What stinks? 

595
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,840
It's not me, Koda.

596
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,880
Ugh! That's the most disgusting thing
I've ever smelled.

597
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,000
Let's go check it out.

598
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:42,240
Hey! Wait a minute! I'm not finished.

599
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,960


600
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:48,200
TUKE: Oh, brother, I have never known
a moose to take this long, eh.

601
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,960
RUTT: Don't rush me.
I can't do it while you're watching.

602
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,280
-Jeez. You're getting it on my leg.
-Sorry.

603
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,480
-Oh, hey, largish bear.
-How's it going, eh?

604
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,520
-Are we glad to see you.
-Yeah, beauty.

605
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,880
We're still getting the brush-off
from those moosettes.

606
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,760
Yeah, they seem immune
to our rugged good looks, eh,

607
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,360
so we thought we'd appeal
to their olfactory senses.

608
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,480
Ew!

609
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,240
Yes, for example,

610
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,000
I'm wearing essence
of wet leaf compost

611
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,400
-with just a hint of sandalwood.
-Ugh!

612
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,680
And I'm augmenting
my natural moosely musk

613
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,320
with a blend of pine needles
and river mud.

614
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:21,240
I got news for you, little brother.
That wasn't mud.

615
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,640
-Ugh!
-RUTT: Gee, eh.

616
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,400
-Kind of overpowering?
-That's no good.

617
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,920
Guys, don't sweat it. I got another plan.

618
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,320
NITA: Oh, yeah.

619
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,760
I think we've all seen
your expertise on romance.

620
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,440
Yeah, very funny.
Don't we have an amulet to burn?

621
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,720
Oh, we can spare a moment.

622
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,600
-Beauty, eh.
-What you need here...

623
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,840
Excuse me.

624
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,320
Is a woman's point of view.

625
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,320
-Yeah?
-And a plan that actually works.

626
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,560
-That's beauty, eh.
-

627
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,560
Hi! I'm playing with my two best friends,
and I need a place to hide.

628
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,400
Aw! Look at the sweet little thing.

629
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,240
Jeez, I could just eat him up.

630
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,400
Hello...

631
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:05,320
-Psst. Go. Go. Get moving.
-Beauty, eh.

632
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,600
Good luck, eh.

633
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,280
-Rutt, would you get going?
-Okay.

634
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,880
Oh, uh, excuse us, ladies.

635
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,440
We're looking for our pal.

636
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,600
-Um, brownish?
-Why, yes.

637
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,240
-Furry?
-Yes, again.

638
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,040
-About yay big?
-That's him!

639
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,560
Haven't seen him.

640
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,640
Ha! Here I am.

641
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,400
I fooled you. I win.

642
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,280
-There's no beating you, little buddy.
-Look at that.

643
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,160
You're so good with him.

644
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,160
Oh, yeah, eh. We have lots
of little kid animal friends.

645
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,640
We know a little weasel
and a little badger.

646
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:39,720
And we've even got some
little baby bunny friends.

647
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,080
Aw...

648
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,960
 Whoa. Smallish bear
is like a babe magnet, eh.

649
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,360


650
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,600
Socialize.

651
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:50,320
So, would you ladies
be interested in grazing on some twigs?

652
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,720
Oh, no, thanks, we just ate. Ow!

653
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,320
We love twigs.

654
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,520
Really? Well, so do we.
Right, little brother?

655
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,280
Shall I compare thee
to a summer's dew?

656
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,360
Oh, jeez.

657
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:04,160
Though it art more lovely
and more dewy than you.

658
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,480
TUKE: Oh, nice move, eh.
MOOSETTE: What's wrong with him?

659
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,120
Don't mind my little brother.

660
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,360
He was trampled by an elk herd
when he was a calf.

661
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,480
Oh, jeez, that's awful.

662
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,320
That's not true. It was only half a herd.

663
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,240
MOOSETTE: You're serious, right?

664
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,560
Smooth.

665
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,960
Um, remind me again
who's the better moose matchmaker.

666
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,240
Beginner's luck.

667
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,840
Jealous?

668
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,720
All right, that was a really nice thing...

669
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,640
Did you see me? I did it.

670
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,120
You can do pretty amazing things
with moose. That's great.

671
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,120
Huh? Hey, wait for me!

672
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,160


673
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,440
Oh, oh, Koda, be careful.

674
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:41,000
Relax, he's fine.
He's just looking for lunch.

675
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,040
Yeah. Besides, I'm always careful. Ow!

676
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,840
Oh, hey, we're making great time.

677
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,160
Look, see, we just go down this trail
until we hit the river.

678
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,320
-River?
-Yeah. And then we swim across.

679
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,680
Swim?

680
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,880
Then it's just a little ways
to Hokani Falls.

681
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,480
We'll be there by lunchtime tomorrow.

682
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:03,240
Well, that's a good plan,
but what about this?

683
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,200
We go up this ridge to that mountain,

684
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,120
climb up those cliffs,
walk across that snow bridge

685
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,920
and avoid the river altogether.

686
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,520
That makes more sense to me.

687
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,360
That doesn't make any sense.

688
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,880
That's way out of the way, and there's
too much up and not enough down.

689
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,920
-I vote for the river.
-Me too.

690
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,960
Two-to-one. We win. Let's eat.

691
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,560
-Well, it's my amulet.
-So?

692
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,200
And my wedding.

693
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,840
Well, then have
your honeymoon up there,

694
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,080
'cause if we go that way now,

695
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,360
we'll have to walk all night
to make it to the falls in time.

696
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,040
Fine. Then I'll meet you there.

697
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,640
Nita, what's wrong with you?

698
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,640
Trust me.
My way will get us there before...

699
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,840


700
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,640


701
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,720
KODA: What's the matter with you?

702
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,880
You act like you're afraid of fish.

703
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:57,120
 My gosh, Kenai,
I can't believe it.

704
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,560
Hey, Kenai, watch this.

705
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,920
Where's the girl who's afraid of fish?

706
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,200
Hi, my name is Nita,
and I'm afraid of fish.

707
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:08,080
I have a fish. The fish is so scary!
Oh, no, he's gonna eat me!

708
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,280
Ahem. Koda, come on.

709
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,560
-Koda, stop.
-No, he almost got me.

710
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,200
Koda, stop!

711
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,240


712
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,240
We were just kidding around
about the fish.

713
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,480
No, it's not the fish.

714
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,880
 It's the water.

715
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:35,160
Ever since that day I fell through the ice
when we were kids...

716
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,760
Oh...

717
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,920
I didn't realize.

718
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,080
That's why I didn't grab
the bag in the river.

719
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,120
It wasn't your fault we lost the amulet.

720
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,920
It was mine.

721
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,280
Hey, we got it back together.
That's all that matters, right?

722
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,920
What are you looking at?

723
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,680
You ready to keep going?

724
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,400
But I'll never be able to cross that river.

725
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,280
We can do that together, too.

726
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,320
<i>

727
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,040
<i>Funny how it turns out</i>

728
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,680
<i>That everything can change</i>

729
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:24,760
<i>What I feel right now</i>
<i>is not the same as yesterday</i>

730
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,560
<i>There's more than I imagined</i>

731
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,840
<i>Deep inside my heart</i>

732
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,200
<i>Emotions that I never knew</i>

733
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,480
<i>And this is just the start</i>

734
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:39,160
<i>So many things</i>
<i>I've been missing not watching</i>

735
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,480
<i>But that was all in the past</i>

736
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:47,520
<i>Now I realize</i>
<i>there's so much more to learn</i>

737
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,720
<i>I'm ready for the world</i>

738
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,960
<i>Not scared of letting go</i>

739
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:56,840
<i>Now I realize</i>
<i>there's so much more to feel</i>

740
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,160
<i>And my heart knows it's real</i>

741
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,640
<i>The part of me so long-forgotten</i>

742
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:06,400
<i>Is calling, and this feels like home</i>

743
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,720
<i>Home, home</i>

744
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,280
<i>Feels just like home</i>

745
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,680
<i>Feels just like home</i>

746
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,840
<i>Right from the start,</i>
<i>been friends forever</i>

747
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:22,200
<i>Somehow we're meant to be together</i>

748
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:27,920
<i>I feel like you've shown me</i>
<i>how to find my way home</i>

749
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,680
<i>Find my way home</i>

750
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,560
<i>Now I realize so much more to learn</i>

751
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,560
<i>I'm ready for the world</i>

752
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,880
<i>Not scared of letting go</i>

753
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:43,800
<i>Now I realize</i>
<i>there's so much more to feel</i>

<i>Feels just like home</i>

759
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,600
It's the only way.

760
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,200
Let me help you.

761
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,640
I changed my mind.

762
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,600
Nope, it's too late for that.
We're going across.

763
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,600
-Whatever happens, don't let go.
-Okay.

764
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:34,160
<i>Now I realize</i>

<i>This feels like home</i>

772
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,080
Thank you, Kenai.

773
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,960
<i>Home, home</i>

774
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:05,640

776
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:22,160
Hey, smallish bear.
So where's big bear, eh?

777
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,320
With Nita.

778
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:29,600
He never has time for me anymore.
He's too busy helping her.

779
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,960
Shee! Boy, do I know how you feel.

780
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:37,320
My own brother gave me the heave-ho,
eh, all for a babe.

781
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,200
Actually, two really, really hot babes.

782
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,720
Better watch your brother
doesn't walk out on you, eh.

783
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,360
He wouldn't do that.

784
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,960
I said the same thing, eh,

785
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,320
but get a load of Moose-anova
over there.

786
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,760
Shall I compare thee
to a summer's dew?

787
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,360
Did you just make that up?

788
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,920
-Beauty, eh.
-He's such a poet.

789
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,360


790
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,360
Yeah, I guess I'll see you around,
little bear.

791
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,560


792
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,560


793
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,720
KENAI: You had a whole clumpful.
NITA: Oh, you're making that up.

794
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:32,680
All I know is I had all my fur
when we went into the river,

795
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,360
and two handfuls were missing
when we came out.

796
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,720
-Well, maybe you're just going bald.
-What?

797
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,920
You know, it does look
really thin right through here.

798
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,080
Yeah, very funny.

799
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,440
This is the most fun I've had
since we were kids.

800
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,840


801
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,320
Fun but cold.

802
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,720
On a night like this,
it's good to be a bear.

803
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,400
I bet. 

804
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:05,000
So, Hokani Falls.

805
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,200
I guess we'll make it there in time, huh?

806
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,280
I guess.

807
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,920
A lot sure has changed
since the last time we were there.

808
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,120
No kidding.

809
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,080
Do you ever miss being human?

810
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:29,120
I mean, have you ever thought about
changing back?

811
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,280
Yeah, I've...

812
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,800
I've thought about it.

813
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:38,960
KODA: I knew it.

814
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:41,920
Koda.

815
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,880
You're going back with her.

816
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,400
Koda, wait. Koda, wait!

817
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:56,880
Koda!

818
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,960
 Koda, answer me!

819
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:23,840
 Koda!

820
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,000
Hello?

821
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,680
Koda? Are you in here?

822
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,320


823
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,880
Where are you?

824
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,360
Koda?

825
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,280


826
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,360
Koda?

827
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,200
Go away.

828
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:11,200
Koda, Kenai's worried sick about you.
Come on, I'll take you to him.

829
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,520
No! I said go away!

830
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,640
Koda, please keep your voice down.
It's not safe.

831
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:22,000
I don't care. Just leave me alone.

832
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,560
No, Nita!

833
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,440
We're gonna be all right,
but we've got to go.

834
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:32,800
Now!

835
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,120


836
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:38,480
Run! Run! Run! Faster!

837
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,760
We're gonna make it.

838
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,760
-Nita!
-Take my hand.

839
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,960


840
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:54,840


841
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,080
Don't move.

842
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:03,600


843
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:06,520


844
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,320
Koda!

845
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:11,840
Hang on!

846
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:13,680
Nita!

847
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:14,840
Don't let go!

848
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,920
-Koda, hold on!
-I am!

849
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,120


850
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,360


851
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,640
Koda.

852
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,680


853
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,800
Koda, what would I have done
if anything happened to you?

854
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:56,640
You're gonna leave me.
You said you missed being one of them.

855
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,600


856
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,000


857
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:10,000
You're going back with her, aren't you?

858
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,280
I do miss things,

859
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,240
but you're my brother.

860
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,920
I'll never leave you.

861
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:22,040
Ah. Not ever.

862
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,880
Ah, this show's giving me
the munchies, eh.

863
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,280
Hey, little brother,
how about you get us some twigs, eh?

864
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,600
 Okay.

865
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,280
Are you crying?

866
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:11,720
No. I mean, well, yeah, but so what, eh?

867
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,320
These lights are so beautiful, eh, I...

868
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,640


869
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,760
Oh, he's sensitive.

870
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:19,720
A moose with depth?

871
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,920
It's beauty, eh.

872
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:23,560
What?

873
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,280
He's a cute one, isn't he?

874
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,640
Hey, I can be sensitive, too, eh.

875
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:29,680
Ooh, I like your hooves.

876
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:30,760
Really?

877
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:34,720
Yeah, and I'm a hoof man.
Yours are nice and shiny.

878
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,080


879
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:39,320
Hoof man? Why didn't I think of that?

880
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,440


881
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,280


882
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,920
Is this the equinox?

883
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:25,520
Yeah, Koda, this is it.

884
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:58,440
My mom is up there somewhere.

885
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:00,840
My mom, too.

886
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:04,000
Do you miss yours?

887
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,360
Yes.

888
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:12,560
But you don't need to wait for the lights
to find her, Koda.

889
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,400
She's always with you.

890
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:17,680
In here.

891
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:24,320
Once you love someone,
they stay in your heart forever.

892
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,560
It's time.

893
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,920
Koda, you be good, okay?

894
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,560
You're such a sweet little cub.

895
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:29,840
-
-

896
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,880
Oh, the spell.

897
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:39,480


898
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,320
Goodbye.

899
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:00,400


900
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,880
<i>

901
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:09,440
<i>If you hear a voice</i>

902
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:12,800
<i>In the middle of the night</i>

903
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:16,040
<i>Saying it'll be all right</i>

904
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,520
<i>It will be me</i>

905
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,800
<i>If you feel a hand</i>

906
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:26,000
<i>Guiding you along</i>

907
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:29,480
<i>When the path seems wrong</i>

908
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,640
<i>It will be me</i>

909
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:36,240
<i>There is no mountain</i>

910
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,160
<i>That I can't climb</i>

911
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:45,640
<i>For you, I'd swim through</i>
<i>the rivers of time</i>

912
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:52,000
<i>As you go your way and I go mine</i>

913
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:55,600
<i>Our light will shine</i>

914
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:00,360
<i>And it will be me</i>

915
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:07,040
<i>It will be me</i>

916
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:14,040
<i>It will be me</i>

917
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:32,800
Kenai, did you give Nita the amulet
because you loved her?

918
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:36,320


919
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,200
It was a long time ago.

920
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:41,920
But she's still with you in here.

921
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,160
I can tell.

922
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,600
Ah, Koda, it doesn't matter.

923
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:52,680
Well, if you do love her,
shouldn't you tell her?

924
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:56,400
It's a little more complicated than that.

925
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:00,680
Anyway, it's over.

926
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,920
Hey, I promised you we'd be the
first two bears to Crowberry Ridge.

927
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:08,400
Pinkie swear, remember?

928
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:12,680
How about first thing in the morning,
we rustle up some more berries?

929
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:13,960
Sound good?

930
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:42,600
Mom, Kenai's so sad.

931
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,800
It's all because of me.

932
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,880
I'll be okay on my own.

933
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:54,480
Tell the spirits to change Kenai back
so he can be happy.

934
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,720


935
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:13,320
RUTT: Jeez, he's really out, eh.
TUKE: Yeah.

936
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,360
Maybe we should
throw some water on his face.

937
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,720
Why don't you just stand
there drooling, eh? That should do it.

938
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:18,800
Trample off.

939
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,880
Oh, wait. Hey, I think I saw him move.

940
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,560
Rise and shine, bear boy!

941
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:27,680
Yeah, not time to hydroplane yet, eh.

942
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:30,160
-It's hibernate, you hoofer.
-That's what I said.

943
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,240
Hey, we saw smallish bear last night.

944
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:35,160
Yeah, we tried to stop him, eh,
but he wouldn't listen to us.

945
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:36,840
What? Where was he going?

946
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:38,200
Uh... Oh.

947
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:39,640
To get Nita, eh.

948
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:41,560
He said he was gonna
bring her back for you.

949
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:44,640
Bring her back? No, no.

950
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:47,200
If he steps foot in the village,
the hunters will get him.

951
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,400
BOTH: Oh, gee.

952
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:54,720
WOMAN: Almost there.

953
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:58,800
And now for the final touch,
a beautiful bead necklace.

954
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:01,280
Oh, no, you don't. Not this time.

955
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:03,200
This is much more appropriate.

956
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,480
Yeah, and that doesn't match
anything she's wearing.

957
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:07,600
And what makes you think
those beads do?

958
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,240
Nita, what would make you happy?

959
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:13,760


960
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,640
Once again, we are ready.

961
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,640
Are you, my daughter?

962
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:23,360
Yes, Father.

963
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:33,040
I would expect a bride
to be smiling on her wedding day.

964
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:35,880
Is there something wrong?

965
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:41,000
 Daddy, I'm so confused.

966
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:47,440
I thought that when I burned the amulet,
the bond would be broken,

967
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,200
but in my heart, I...

968
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:54,320


969
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:57,400
I'm sorry, Daddy.

970
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:01,040
I can't marry Atka.

971
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:07,520
Nita...

972
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:10,080
WOMAN: 
A bear! There's a bear in the village!

973
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:12,280
It's a bear.

974
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:15,120
Koda? Wait! Wait, don't hurt him.

975
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,280
No, our fish!

976
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:19,120
I got him!

977
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:20,960
We've got him now!

978
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:24,600
-Look, he's up in the tree!
-There he is. Get him!

979
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:26,160
Don't!

980
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:27,600
Don't! Please stop!

981
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,160


982
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,600


983
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,440
Look out, here he comes!

984
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:37,240


985
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:39,240
-Get your spears!
-Come on!

986
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:41,040
-Let's go after him.
-Atka, no!

987
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:44,760
-Leave him alone.
-Get him!

988
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:51,760
Oh, no. Run!

989
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:52,960
MAN: This way.

990
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:56,320
After them!

991
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,360
Nita, are you hurt?

992
00:57:58,520 --> 00:57:59,880
I have to stop them.

993
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:05,000
There he is! Let's get him!

994
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:08,560


995
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:10,520
Follow me!

996
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,440
Rock! Look out! Get out of the way!

997
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:20,320
Stay low.

998
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:23,240
Kenai!

999
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:25,520


1000
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:29,960


1001
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:33,040
Hmm...

1002
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,800
There you are. Got you!

1003
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:39,840


1004
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:40,960


1005
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:47,760


1006
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:49,120
Nice move, eh.

1007
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,960
-
-Gee, eh.

1008
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,680
BOTH: Oh! Our heroes.

1009
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:55,600


1010
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:56,800
Beauty, eh.

1011
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:59,240
Come on! We have to find Kenai.

1012
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:15,040


1013
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,240
-Aah!
-

1014
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:32,720
Kenai!

1015
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,280
No, don't!

1016
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:47,160


1017
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:48,520


1018
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,120
 Kenai!

1019
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:56,400


1020
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:02,880


1021
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:05,480
NITA: How could you?

1022
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:08,120
-What?
-He was my friend.

1023
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:19,200


1024
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:21,000
Kenai?

1025
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:31,920


1026
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:51,920


1027
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:59,680
I can't... I don't understand. I'm sorry.

1028
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:19,640
I love you, too.

1029
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:40,320
The spirits?

1030
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:44,200
Kenai, I can understand you.

1031
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:48,120
I asked the spirits
to turn you back into a man.

1032
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:50,480
-What?
-So you could be with Nita.

1033
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:52,640
No, Koda.

1034
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:56,560
It's okay.
I just want you to be happy again.

1035
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:02,120
Nita, I can't.

1036
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:10,400
But I can.

1037
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:16,520
Am I the only one that hears
these bears speaking?

1038
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:19,280
-Yeah, that's beauty, eh.
-How's it going, eh?

1039
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:20,960
Father.

1040
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:27,000
Is this what you want?

1041
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:30,600
Will this make you happy?

1042
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:36,760
You are my daughter

1043
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:39,720
and I will love you
no matter what you choose.

1044
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:10,560


1045
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:15,800


1046
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:30,640


1047
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:45,760


1048
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:46,880
Nita?

1049
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,200


1050
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:54,160
How do I look?

1051
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:57,840
Like a bear,
except they gave you antlers.

1052
01:03:58,120 --> 01:03:59,320
What?

1053
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:01,080
Gotcha!

1054
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:02,680


1055
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:22,080
<i>Life is simple and clear</i>

1056
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:24,680
<i>When you make the right choice</i>

1057
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:26,720
<i>It's truth that you hear</i>

1058
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:29,280
<i>When you find your own voice</i>

1059
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:33,040
<i>Oh, my brothers and sisters, believe</i>

1060
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:36,920
<i>You are just what you are meant to be</i>

1061
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:40,400
<i>Oh, great spirits</i>

1062
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:45,800
<i>Hear my voice today</i>

1063
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:48,680
-I love happy endings, eh.
-I love happy endings, too.

1064
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:50,560
And happy beginnings.

1065
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:52,480
-Beauty, eh.
-Beauty.

1066
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:53,560


1067
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:56,280
-Ow!

1134
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:06,920
<i>For you, I'd swim through</i>
<i>the rivers of time</i>

1135
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:13,600
<i>As you go your way</i>
<i>and I go mine</i>

1136
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:16,920
<i>Our light will shine</i>

1137
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:21,680
<i>And it will be me</i>

1138
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,520
<i>If there is a key</i>

1139
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:32,840
<i>That goes to your heart</i>

1140
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:36,160
<i>A special part</i>

1141
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,360
<i>It will be me</i>

1142
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,360
<i>If you need a friend</i>

1143
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:45,840
<i>Call out to the wind</i>

1144
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:48,920
<i>To hold you again</i>

1145
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,360
<i>It will be me</i>

1146
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:55,520
<i>Oh, how the world</i>

1147
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:58,720
<i>Seems so unfair</i>

1148
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:05,080
<i>Creating a love</i>
<i>that cannot be shared</i>

1149
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:12,200
<i>As you go your way</i>

01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:28,720
<i>Past the everafter</i>

1153
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:34,280
<i>There's a place for two</i>

1154
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:41,160
<i>In your tears</i>
<i>and laughter</i>

1155
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:47,960
<i>I'll be there for you</i>

1156
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:53,920
<i>In the sun and the moon</i>

1157
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:57,240
<i>In the land</i>
<i>and the sea</i>

1158
01:10:57,880 --> 01:11:00,600
<i>Look all around you</i>

1159
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:03,800
<i>It will be me</i>

1160
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:07,280
<i>There is no mountain</i>

1161
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,920
<i>That I can't climb</i>

1162

<i>For you, I'd swim through</i>

1164
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:26,400
<i>Our light will shine</i>

1165
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:31,000
<i>And it will be me</i>

1166
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:37,480
<i>It will be me</i>

1167
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:45,400
