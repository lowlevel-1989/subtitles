00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:48,464
This is a story from long ago,

3
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:52,134
when the great mammoths
still roamed our lands.

4
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:57,890
It's the story
of my two brothers and me.

5
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,350
When the three of us were young,

6
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:04,104
we were taught
that the world is full of magic.

7
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:13,280
The source of this magic
is the ever-changing lights

8
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,574
that dance across the sky.

9
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,121
The shaman woman of our village

10
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:25,209
told us that these lights
are the spirits of our ancestors,

11
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:29,838
and that they have the power
to make changes in our world.

12
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:36,053
Small things become big.

13
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,682
Winter turns to spring.

14
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:47,523
One thing always changes
into another.

15
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:52,778
But the greatest change I ever saw

16
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:54,738
was that of my brother,

17
00:01:55,365 --> 00:02:00,369
a boy who desperately
wanted to be a man.

18
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,707
- Get down.
- What?

19
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:08,001
Get down! Get down!

20
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,301
Kenai.

21
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,740
Never try to milk a caribou.

22
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:46,748
No. No, don't. No. Come on, don't. No.

23
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,251
Hey. Will you two knock it off?

24
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:52,921
That's all right.
After today, he won't treat me like that.

25
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:56,133
Right, the big manhood ceremony.

26
00:02:56,551 --> 00:03:00,012
Doesn't matter what the spirits say,
you'll always be our baby brother.

27
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:02,973
- Well, wait till I get my totem.
- Baby brother.

28
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,768
Hey, I said knock it off.

29
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:10,105
The quicker we get these fish,
the faster we get to your ceremony.

30
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:14,067
Let's all just try and get along
for a few hours. Okay, Denahi?

31
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,403
- Whatever you say.
- Okay, Ken...

32
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,780
So, what are we waiting for?

33
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:33,295
When the Earth was young
and the air was sweet

34
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:38,133
And the mountains kissed the sky

35
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,221
In the great beyond

36
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,640
With its many paths

37
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:48,644
Man and nature lived side by side

38
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,691
In this wilderness of danger and beauty

39
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,988
Lived three brothers bonded by love

40
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:04,826
Their hearts full ofjoy

41
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,329
They ask now for guidance

42
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:11,750
Reaching out to the skies up above

43
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:16,004
Great spirits of all who lived before

44
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,840
Take our hands and lead us

45
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:23,303
Fill our hearts and souls
with all you know

46
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:27,182
Show us that in your eyes

47
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,351
We are all the same

48
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:34,690
Brothers to each other
in this world we remain

49
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:37,776
Truly brothers all the same

50
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:42,030
Give us wisdom to pass to each other

51
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:47,202
And give us strength so we understand

52
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,207
That the things we do

53
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,418
The choices we make

54
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:58,338
Give direction to all life's plans

55
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:04,720
To look and wonder
at all we've been given

56
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:09,975
In a world that's not always as it seems

57
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:14,313
Every corner we turn

58
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,940
Only leads to another

59
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:21,403
A journey ends but another begins

60
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,824
Great spirits of all who lived before

61
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:28,577
Take our hands and lead us

62
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:32,914
Fill our hearts and souls
with all you know

63
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,960
Show us that in your eyes

64
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,046
We are all the same

65
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:44,593
Brothers to each other
in this world we remain

66
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:47,220
Truly brothers all the same

67
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,806
- Kenai's back.
- Kenai.

68
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:53,477
Kenai, are you excited
about getting your spirit rock today?

69
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:56,772
It's not a rock. It'll be my totem.

70
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:01,360
I'll probably get a sabre-tooth tiger
for bravery,

71
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,403
or strength, or greatness.

72
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:06,990
- Something that fits me.
- A mammoth for your fat head?

73
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:10,118
- Make sure you get that basket tied up.
- Don't worry.

74
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,746
No stupid bear
is gonna get near this fish.

75
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:16,875
Just tie it up.

76
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:20,837
- She's back. Tanana's back.
- Come on.

77
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:24,174
- Come on, Kenai, let's go.
- Come on.

78
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:26,510
Tanana's got your rock. Come on.

79
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,977
Great spirits of all who lived before

80
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,355
Take our hands and lead us

81
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:42,818
Fill our hearts and souls
with all you know

82
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:46,696
Show us that in your eyes

83
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:49,533
We are all the same

84
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:54,162
Brothers to each other
in this world we remain

85
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:57,874
Truly brothers all the same

86
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:02,838
Brothers all the same

87
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:04,840
Nana.

88
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:09,553
- Hey, Nana.
- Well, hello there, sweetheart.

89
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:12,013
What a big girl.

90
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:20,105
When each of us comes of age,
the great spirits reveal to us a totem

91
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:23,066
that helps guide us through our lives.

92
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:26,695
Some of us use courage to guide us.

93
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,739
Others patience.

94
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:34,786
And some of us beauty.

95
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:39,207
Kenai.

96
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,463
- You nervous?
- Excited.

97
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,591
You should be. It's a good one.

98
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:53,138
Kenai, I have been to the mountain
where the lights touch the earth,

99
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:58,018
and the great spirits
have revealed to me your totem.

100
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:04,691
To become a man, your actions
must be guided by one thing.

101
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:09,488
Your totem is...

102
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:13,909
Love.

103
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:18,079
- What?
- Yes, love.

104
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,208
The bear of love?

105
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:25,795
A love that connects
and unites all living things.

106
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,840
- Who wants to trade?
- There is no trading.

107
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,593
Oh, Kenai,

108
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,638
love is the most precious of totems.

109
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:37,933
It reveals itself in unexpected ways.

110
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:43,438
Let love guide your actions,
then one day you'll be a man,

111
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:48,902
and we'll place your mark
next to those of our ancestors.

112
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,386
There he is.

113
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,721
Come here, lover boy.

114
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,474
- Leave me alone.
- Kenai, wait.

115
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:22,811
- I'm sorry.
- What?

116
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:25,480
Your totem, I think it's really great.

117
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:28,275
- You do?
- Yeah. And I made you something.

118
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:29,609
Really?

119
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:32,487
Now when you skip around
loving everybody,

120
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,198
you'll smell so sweet.

121
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,158
Well, isn't this nice?

122
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,619
Instead of fighting,
you're giving each other flowers.

123
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:43,498
Yeah, isn't it lovely?
He's so in touch with his totem already.

124
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,835
Hey, dog breath,
go take care of the fish.

125
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:50,005
Sure. Kenai loves me, he loves me not.

126
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:53,925
Kenai loves me, he loves me not.
Kenai loves me, he loves...

127
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,846
- Kenai.
- Someday I'm gonna just...

128
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:00,599
- He's just such a...
- Hey, bonehead.

129
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:03,852
Just because his totem is wisdom
doesn't mean he's wise.

130
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:07,230
- I mean, look at him.
- Kenai loves me, he loves me not.

131
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,691
- Hi, Denahi.
- Hi.

132
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,527
Let go!

133
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,530
Yeah, the spirits messed up
on both of our totems.

134
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:18,074
I felt the same way
when Tanana gave me mine.

135
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,035
- Get out of here.
- No, really.

136
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:24,205
I said, "The eagle of guidance?
What does that mean?"

137
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,167
But now that I'm older,
I know it's about being a leader

138
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:29,044
and keeping an eye on you two.

139
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,757
I just want to get my handprint
on that wall.

140
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:38,386
Just be patient, Kenai.
When you live by your totem, you will.

141
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,555
- Really?
- Guarantee it.

142
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:47,145
But come on, the bear of love?

143
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:49,356
I mean, a bear doesn't love anyone.

144
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:52,400
They don't think. They don't feel.
I mean, they're...

145
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:57,697
- They're thieves.
- You didn't tie it up, did you?

146
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,575
You should get the totem of pinheads.

147
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:01,868
Knock it off.

148
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,037
- We'll just make another basket.
- We?

149
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,707
Oh, no. It took me two weeks
to make that basket.

150
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:11,711
Get lover boy to do it.
He's the one always messing things up.

151
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:15,048
- Typical Kenai.
- All right, I'll go get your basket.

152
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:18,093
Kenai, wait. Kenai!

153
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,430
What?

154
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:49,624
Kenai!

155
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:52,752
- Where'd he go?
- If we're lucky, far away.

156
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:58,591
Kenai!

157
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,848
- Kenai.
- Sitka, no, you gotta get out of here.

158
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:06,766
- What?
- The bear. Behind you.

159
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,480
Hey, bear, come on. Over here.

160
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,858
Come on, bear, come this way.

161
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:29,789
Denahi!

162
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:34,085
- Hold on.
- Pull.

163
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,951
Sitka. Sitka!

164
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,186
Sitka.

165
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:47,659
Come on!

166
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,164
- Sitka!
- Sitka!

167
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,252
Sitka. Sitka!

168
00:13:57,294 --> 00:14:00,088
- Sitka?
- Sitka, where are you?

169
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:02,131
Kenai.

170
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:14,686
No.

171
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:21,234
Sitka!

172
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,446
Denahi, let's find him!

173
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:26,823
Sitka.

174
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,660
Sitka, where are you? Sitka!

175
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:36,100
- You ready?
- For what?

176
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,186
For going after the bear.

177
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:43,858
I know what you're feeling,
but killing that bear is wrong.

178
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:47,779
Wrong? Our brother is dead
and it's because of that monster.

179
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,740
I don't blame the bear, Kenai.

180
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:58,790
- I see.
- Killing the bear won't make you a man.

181
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,208
Now you're trying to be wise.

182
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,044
I'm trying to follow my totem.
Why can't you?

183
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:06,214
You really think love
has anything to do with being a man?

184
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:09,300
A man wouldn't just sit here
and do nothing.

185
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:13,513
Kenai. Don't upset the spirits.

186
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:17,475
Spirits. Thanks for your wisdom.

187
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,544
I've got to stop him.

188
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:55,388
You left too soon, Sitka.

189
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:58,016
Your brothers need your guidance.

190
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:36,757
Kenai.

191
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:39,820
What?

192
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,562
Sitka.

193
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,330
No.

194
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:52,138
I don't blame the bear, Kenai.

195
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:58,561
A man wouldn't just sit here
and do nothing.

196
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:53,741
So, Kenai,
you've decided to join the living.

197
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,285
That's quite a bump you've got.

198
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:59,288
That must have been one heck of a ride
down the rapids.

199
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:00,789
Tanana?

200
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,255
Nana, you won't believe this.

201
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:10,758
I was at the top of this rock,
and all of a sudden...

202
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:15,763
Kenai, honey.

203
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,682
I don't speak bear.

204
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,606
No.

205
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:29,276
No, no! No!

206
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:37,660
All right! All right! All right!
Would you settle down? Settle!

207
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:40,788
Kenai! Kenai...

208
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:44,833
Kenai. Kenai. This isn't going to work.

209
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:51,715
Kenai, listen to me. Sitka did this.

210
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:57,805
Strange. Spirits don't usually
make these kind of changes.

211
00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:00,766
Oh, my, my, my, my.

212
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:04,019
Sitka must have something really big
planned for you. Yep, yep.

213
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:06,772
You are going to get
a whole new perspective on things.

214
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:11,318
Do you see in black and white
or colour?

215
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:14,947
Hey. Listen to me.
You got yourself into this mess.

216
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:18,325
If you want to change,
take it up with your brother's spirit.

217
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:24,748
You'll find him on the mountain
where the lights touch the earth.

218
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,501
He'll help you make up
for what you've done wrong.

219
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:30,337
But I didn't do anything wrong.

220
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:33,257
Tanana? Tanana!

221
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:36,260
Wait. I didn't do anything wrong.

222
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:40,014
- I don't even know how to get there.
- What happened to them?

223
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:43,350
- I don't know.
- They were here. Now they're gone.

224
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:45,394
Yeah, that's pretty weird.

225
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:49,690
So you're telling me you didn't eat them
and you have no idea where they are?

226
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:53,360
Hey, hey, you. You just talked.

227
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:56,614
Just back away, real slow-like.

228
00:26:56,698 --> 00:27:00,367
- How did you do that?
- I knew you had them.

229
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:02,828
Are we there yet?

230
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:05,623
Don't make me
turn this formation around.

231
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:11,128
Hey. Wait. Come back.
I'm trying to find where the lights...

232
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:15,841
- What's he getting worked up about?
- Maybe the goose pooped on him?

233
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:20,137
He's looking over here.
Let's beat it. This way.

234
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:23,307
- No, this way.
- Thank you very much.

235
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:25,893
- Just stay still and...
- Hey, you two!

236
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:28,062
Head down.

237
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:30,064
I think he's seen us. Now what?

238
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:32,900
- Act like we're not here.
- We're not here.

239
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:35,235
- What are you doing?
- You said to...

240
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:37,029
- Don't say anything.
- Okay.

241
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,405
- I said, "Don't say anything."
- Excuse me.

242
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:42,993
- Don't eat us.
- You won't like us, eh? We're gamey.

243
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,079
Yeah. Eat hoof-for-brains over there.

244
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,748
- Pine-cone breath.
- Crusty tail.

245
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:50,292
- Twig legs.
- Big nose.

246
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:52,711
- Sorry.
- You went too far that time.

247
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,672
- Okay, I'm sorry.
- Guys.

248
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:58,092
- Yours is bigger than mine.
- I'm not eating anybody.

249
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:02,805
- That's mighty decent of you, eh.
- My name's Rutt.

250
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:05,099
- This is my brother Tuke.
- How's it going, Bear?

251
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:09,061
- Don't call me that.
- Sorry...

252
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:13,816
- Mr Bear?
- I mean, I'm not a bear. I hate bears.

253
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:17,945
- Well, gee, you're one big beaver.
- No kidding, eh?

254
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:21,115
Do either of you know
where the lights touch the earth?

255
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:27,955
No. No. Sorry, bear... Beaver.

256
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:31,625
I'm not a beaver, I'm a bear...
No, I mean, I'm not a bear.

257
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:33,919
- I'm a man.
- Excuse me.

258
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:36,588
I was transformed into a bear.

259
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:40,300
Magically. I was lifted into the sky
by my brother.

260
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:44,096
- Crazy.
- Gesundheit.

261
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,223
No. Fruitcake.

262
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:49,226
- Are you okay?
- No. That bear. Over there.

263
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,520
- He's crazy.
- I am not crazy.

264
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,857
Whoever said you were?
We understand.

265
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:57,109
- You do?
- Yeah, yeah.

266
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:59,278
You see, we're not moose either.

267
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,821
- We're not?
- No.

268
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:04,283
We're like squirrels. Yeah.

269
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:07,077
Yeah. Beauty, eh?

270
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:11,957
Well, he's actually the squirrel.
I'm more of a purebred wolverine.

271
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,500
Look at these cuspids.

272
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:18,630
- Give him a little room.
- Why am I talking to moose?

273
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:21,216
- No, we're squirrels, eh.
- Wolverine.

274
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:24,344
I'll find it myself.

275
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:27,765
- I wouldn't go that way.
- Why not, eh?

276
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,851
Well, there was a reason.

277
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:33,270
- You brought it up.
- I'm trying to...

278
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:45,365
- So, you think of it yet?
- Well, no, but it's driving me nuts.

279
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,050
Hey. Is the coast clear?

280
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:05,886
- What?
- Are there any hunters around?

281
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:08,889
- No.
- Good!

282
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:11,183
You didn't see the trap?

283
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:15,270
I saw it from a mile away.
You must be pretty embarrassed.

284
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:16,605
Don't worry.

285
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:20,067
I won't tell anyone.

286
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:22,653
- What?
- You need to get down. Let me help.

287
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:23,821
Oh, wait.

288
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:26,990
- Hold still.
- Just... Stop that.

289
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,159
If you just...

290
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:32,120
- Stop it!
- It's no use.

291
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:36,875
The only way to get down
is to chew your own foot off.

292
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:40,879
I don't need some stupid bear's help.
I just need the stick.

293
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:43,257
- Okay, here.
- No, I'll do it myself.

294
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,926
Put it back. No, where you found it.

295
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,887
To the left. By the little rock.

296
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,347
- Here?
- Yes.

297
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:51,807
Okay.

298
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:55,561
Boy, that tree is strong, huh?

299
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:58,689
You know, when I was little,
I was really into climbing trees.

300
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:00,023
All kinds of trees.

301
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:05,863
I climbed pine trees, oaks, cedars,
maples, birch trees, willow trees...

302
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:08,073
My eyes were watering
and my tongue was swollen.

303
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:11,785
From that moment on,
I was more careful about what I lick.

304
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:21,587
See? It's all about using your head.

305
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,509
That was funny. Do it again.

306
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:31,263
- Don't you have someplace to go?
- Yeah, the salmon run.

307
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:36,435
How about this?
I get you down, then we go together.

308
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:39,479
- Deal?
- Yeah, okay, fine.

309
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:42,983
If you can magically get me down,
I'll go with you to this...

310
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:46,111
- Salmon run.
- Whatever. But if you can't...

311
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:50,490
You turn around, walk away,
and never come back, ever.

312
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,326
- You swear?
- Yeah.

313
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:55,329
- Pinkie swear?
- Yeah, sure, fine, pinkie swear.

314
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:58,332
But this is a human trap
and you're just a dumb little bear.

315
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,500
There's no way
you're going to be able...

316
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:09,092
Okay, so I'm thinking
we travel by day and sleep by night.

317
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:12,012
My bedtime is an hour after sunset...

318
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:15,515
Run!

319
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,809
Yeah, good riddance.

320
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:34,201
Denahi.

321
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:35,661
Denahi, you found me.

322
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:39,498
You wouldn't believe
what a nightmare this has been.

323
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,543
Denahi? It's me. Kenai.

324
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,537
Is he gone?

325
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:20,414
I think he was going...

326
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:30,757
Hello. I can't breathe.

327
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:48,650
- Why is he chasing me?
- That's what they do.

328
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:52,446
- But it's not like him.
- Lucky for him, he didn't find us

329
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:55,323
'cause when I get in a fight,
I go all crazy

330
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:57,868
and I'm a raging ball of brown fur.

331
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:02,831
I mean, I don't want to brag or nothing,
but I got some moves.

332
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:06,752
- Really?
- Yep. This first one, well...

333
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:10,922
It's just a little thing
I like to call "The Slasher."

334
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:15,552
And this one I like to call
"Flying Fury of Death."

335
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:19,139
- He's coming back.
- Where?

336
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:21,892
Typical.

337
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:25,228
Yeah, well,
the next time we run into that hunter...

338
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:28,982
There is no "we."
I'm not taking you to any salmon run.

339
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:31,651
What? But you pinkie swore.

340
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,487
Yeah, well, things change.

341
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:35,822
See you, kid.

342
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:38,575
Wait...

343
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:45,999
The truth is,
I got separated from my mom.

344
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:48,794
And now, with this hunter around...

345
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:52,923
- Kid, I got my own problems.
- Come on. Please.

346
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:56,885
Can't we just go together?
There's a lot of bears and a ton of fish,

347
00:34:56,969 --> 00:35:00,597
and every night we watch the lights
touch the mountain. Last year...

348
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:03,683
- Wait, wait. What did you say?
- Lots of bears and fish.

349
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:06,103
No. You know
where the lights touch the earth?

350
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:09,147
Yeah! The top of the mountain
right by the salmon run.

351
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:12,734
- You're kidding me.
- No, no, they're practically next door.

352
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:15,195
Come on, I'll show you. It'll be great.

353
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:19,783
I promise to help you escape
from every trap you walk into.

354
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:21,576
I'm not going to walk into any more...

355
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:27,082
- Traps.
- Come on. What do you say?

356
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:31,503
Sure you can take me
to where the lights touch the earth?

357
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,380
Yeah, no problem.

358
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:42,180
- If you slow me down...
- I won't, I promise.

359
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,809
All right, we leave first thing tomorrow.

360
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,200
And keep all that cuddly bear stuff
to a minimum, okay, kid?

361
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:05,203
My name's not "kid." It's Koda.

362
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:14,671
What's your name?

363
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,262
- Good day.
- How's it going, eh?

364
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:26,683
Beauty. So we got a lot to get done
today. You want to get started?

365
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,768
- Yeah. Just give me one sec, eh?
- Okay.

366
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:34,649
- Just help me crack this.
- All right.

367
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,612
- You ready now?
- Almost.

368
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,991
Just want to do "dog facing forward."

369
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:47,078
- Come on.
- Good. Okay.

370
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:48,747
And go.

371
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,417
This a nice patch here.

372
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,962
Don't go near this patch here.
Something went here.

373
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:39,297
Skinny. Fat. Skinny. Fat.

374
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:42,342
Hey, I've got a mountain to get to.
Come on, kid.

375
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:45,887
I told you before. My name's Koda.

376
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:48,974
Say it with me. Ko... Da.

377
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:52,018
Sure your mom didn't ditch you,
Ko-duh?

378
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:03,363
- Rutt.
- Go away, I'm eating twigs.

379
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:06,700
- Rutt.
- You're breaking my concentration.

380
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:09,536
We should start running, like now!

381
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:14,040
I can't. I'm still digesting. I'll get cramps.

382
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:23,466
- He's after us!
- Come on, little brother.

383
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:25,885
Cramp!

384
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:30,348
If you really want to know
how me and my mom got separated...

385
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:34,894
I was saving this story
for the salmon run, but I'll tell you.

386
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:41,234
It was probably the fifth or sixth
most coldest day in my entire life.

387
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:44,404
- Sounds good. You should save it.
- You think so?

388
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:46,906
Yeah. For your friends.

389
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:50,076
- Well, I have this other story.
- Tell you what.

390
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:53,288
- How about no talking?
- Okay.

391
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:55,707
- Then I'll sing.
- No, no, no.

392
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,376
Tell everybody I'm on my way

393
00:38:58,419 --> 00:38:59,794
Will you stop it?

394
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:01,838
New friends and new places to see

395
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:03,590
Come on, quit it.

396
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:05,467
Koda, stop singing.

397
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,970
Yes, I'm on my way

398
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:13,433
And there's nowhere else
that I'd rather be

399
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:18,563
Tell everybody I'm on my way

400
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:22,442
And I'm loving every step I take

401
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:27,447
With the sun beating down
Yes, I'm on my way

402
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:31,951
And I can't keep this smile off my face

403
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:37,165
'Cause there's nothing like
seeing each other again

404
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:41,211
No matter what the distance between

405
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:48,676
And the stories that we tell
will make you smile

406
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:52,722
Oh, it really lifts my heart

407
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:56,309
So tell them all I'm on my way

408
00:39:56,394 --> 00:40:00,688
New friends and new places to see

409
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:05,693
And to sleep under the stars
Who could ask for more?

410
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:09,322
With the moon keeping watch over me

411
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:15,161
Not the snow, not the rain
can change my mind

412
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:19,499
The sun will come out, wait and see

413
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:23,336
And the feeling of the wind in your face

414
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:27,173
Can lift your heart, whoa

415
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:30,301
There's nowhere I would rather be

416
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:35,515
'Cause I'm on my way now

417
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:40,061
Well and true

418
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:44,816
I'm on my way now

419
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:48,361
Hey, hold on, eh?

420
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,571
Wait up.

421
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:55,160
- How's it going, bear boy?
- And smallish bear.

422
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:57,579
I didn't know you had a little brother.
He's cute.

423
00:40:57,663 --> 00:41:01,583
- Actually, he's...
- There was this hunter following us.

424
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:04,878
We was thinking if we could
maybe just hang out with you guys.

425
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,547
- Just hang out.
- Yeah, it'd be fun.

426
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:10,884
- If the hunter was going to catch up...
- Then you'd eat him.

427
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:14,554
- That's what we was thinking.
- We lost the hunter at the glacier.

428
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,514
You don't think he'll follow those?

429
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:21,311
- They are quite nice.
- I've got an idea.

430
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:23,897
Okay, this is really weird.

431
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:28,234
- I'm driving.
- When can I have a turn?

432
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:31,404
It's not as easy as it looks.
Just watch what I do.

433
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:35,074
Let's get a back seat or something.
I look like you hunted me.

434
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:38,786
Tell everybody I'm on my way

435
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:40,163
Hey, come on.

436
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:43,124
And I just can't wait to be there

437
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:48,922
Blue skies ahead
Yes, I'm on my way

438
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:54,010
Nothing but good times to share

439
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:57,764
So tell everybody I'm on my way

440
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:01,935
And I just can't wait to be home

441
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:07,690
With the sun beating down
Yes, I'm on my way

442
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:12,237
With nothing but good times to show

443
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:15,698
I'm on my way

444
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:19,577
Yes, I'm on my way

445
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:22,121
Beauty, eh?

446
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:27,085
Okay, here's how I remember it.
The snow is white, it's all right.

447
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:29,587
Yellow or green, it's just not clean.

448
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,297
I learned that one the hard way.

449
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:35,969
That reminds me. Last year at the
salmon run my friend Bucky dared me.

450
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:39,138
But I'd heard of a cub
who stuck his tongue to an iceberg.

451
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:41,099
Then he started to float away.

452
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:43,977
To save him
they had to rip off his tongue,

453
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:46,980
so now he hath to talk like thith
all the time and...

454
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:48,940
Do you ever stop talking?

455
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:52,485
Look. The night rainbow.

456
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:56,656
- You can see the spirits from here.
- You know about the great spirits?

457
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,993
Yeah, my grandma's up there,
and my granddad.

458
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:04,747
Mom says the spirits make
all the magical changes in the world.

459
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:08,668
Like how the leaves change colour,
or the moon changes shapes,

460
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:12,380
- or tadpoles change into frogs.
- Yeah, I get it.

461
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:17,010
You know, for a change, maybe
they could just leave things alone.

462
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:20,054
- What do you mean?
- My brother's a spirit.

463
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:23,057
If it wasn't for him, I...

464
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:25,018
I wouldn't be here.

465
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:27,312
You have a brother up there?

466
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:32,734
- What happened to him?
- He was killed by a...

467
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:36,195
By a monster.

468
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:43,786
What's your brother's name?

469
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,997
Sitka.

470
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:50,293
Thanks, Sitka. If it weren't for you,
I would have never met Kenai.

471
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:58,343
I always wanted a brother.

472
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:20,406
So, you want to play "I spy"?

473
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:23,409
- All right. I'll go first.
- Okay.

474
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:27,288
I spy something green.

475
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:30,875
Tree?

476
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:32,126
- My turn?
- Yeah.

477
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:35,213
Okay, I spy something tall.

478
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:38,216
- Tree.
- Okay.

479
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:43,346
I spy something with bark.

480
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:44,764
Tree?

481
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:46,849
Okay, I spy something...

482
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:49,894
- A vertical log.
- Tree.

483
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:53,272
- Okay, I spy something...
- Tree.

484
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:55,149
- My turn.
- Tree.

485
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:56,442
- No, I...
- It counts.

486
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,861
- I didn't even spy anything.
- It counts.

487
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:01,197
Okay. Tree.

488
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:04,617
Let's play something else.

489
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:13,835
Koda. Come on.

490
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:17,213
- Koda, wake up.
- Two more months, Mom.

491
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:22,885
So, where are we?

492
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:32,687
Well, which way?

493
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:37,316
- I think it's that way.
- You think, or you know?

494
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,485
That way?

495
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:42,989
Why wasn't I turned
into a homing pigeon?

496
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:46,659
- Come on.
- Hey, riding mammoths was your idea.

497
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:49,162
Thanks for the ride, guys. See you.

498
00:45:49,204 --> 00:45:51,748
Lucky for you,
I've been lost worse than this.

499
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:55,001
- Last summer, I was with Bucky...
- Enough with the stories.

500
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:57,462
I don't care about the time
you and Binky found

501
00:45:57,504 --> 00:46:00,047
the world's biggest pine cone ever.

502
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:04,010
First of all, his name's Bucky, not Binky.

503
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:06,554
Second, it wasn't a pine cone,
it was a pine nut.

504
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:09,682
And it was huge.
Even bigger than your fat head.

505
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:12,393
Our big guardian bear is leaving, eh?

506
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:14,854
Yeah. We'd better follow him. Come on.

507
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:18,024
- Can you swing your leg...
- I can't get off.

508
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:20,860
Me, neither. Okay, you guys...

509
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:24,906
I guess we'll just catch up
with those guys later, eh?

510
00:46:26,241 --> 00:46:27,825
- Good trip, eh?
- Beauty.

511
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:31,788
You know, I was thinking now
might be a good time for me to drive.

512
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:34,415
Just relax and enjoy the ride.

513
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,209
Yeah. Okay.

514
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:42,131
I'm sorry we're lost, okay?

515
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:45,051
- Even though it's your fault.
- My fault?

516
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:46,552
That's it.

517
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:50,306
Just remember, if it weren't for me,
you'd be hanging upside down.

518
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:54,727
Better than being stuck nowhere
with you and your blabbering mouth.

519
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:58,356
"I'm lost. I can't find my mommy.
Will you take me to the salmon run?"

520
00:46:58,398 --> 00:47:01,442
- Why don't you just grow up?
- Fine. I'll go on my own then.

521
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:03,694
- Fine. Go ahead.
- Fine.

522
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:05,071
- Fine.
- Fine.

523
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:26,425
Koda?

524
00:48:31,366 --> 00:48:33,868
Those monsters are really scary.

525
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:37,163
Especially with those sticks.

526
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:56,474
Come on, let's go.

527
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:01,020
So, you recognise anything yet?

528
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:04,023
Or maybe you can't see past
my fat head.

529
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:09,737
So, do you really think
I have a fat head?

530
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:13,199
Well, if you hunched your shoulders
a little it wouldn't seem so big.

531
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:15,701
You mean like this?

532
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:17,620
Or like this?

533
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:19,705
How about this?

534
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:22,875
Oh, my, that was good.

535
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:25,044
Maybe they can give us directions.

536
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:29,048
- That clears up the sinuses.
- Oh, it does.

537
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:31,342
Okay, okay, hit me again.
I think she's looking.

538
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:35,721
- Hello, sweetie.
- Yes, she's checking me out, all right.

539
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:38,224
- Hey, baby.
- No, come on, you nitwit.

540
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:40,601
Are you out of your head?
She's looking at me.

541
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:43,646
Like she's looking at your ugly mug?
Come on.

542
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:46,065
Excuse me, miss. It's go-time, baby.

543
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:48,150
You want to go? Bring it on.

544
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:49,902
- Horns up.
- Hold on.

545
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:52,154
- Excuse me.
- What do you want?

546
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:55,449
- What is that?
- Just a minute, bear.

547
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:57,618
Hey, shut up.

548
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:02,748
No, you shut up.

549
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:04,792
Hey, will you shut up?

550
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:07,545
Just shut up.

551
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:10,715
Their horns are screwed on too tight.

552
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,094
Wait a second.

553
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:18,723
- I know this place.
- You do?

554
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:21,100
Yeah. The salmon run's not far.

555
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:24,478
We just have to go through here.

556
00:50:37,784 --> 00:50:39,118
What?

557
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:45,082
Hey, you sure you know
where you're going?

558
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:47,126
Yeah, yeah, follow me.

559
00:50:54,551 --> 00:51:04,060
Koda?

560
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:06,687
Where are you?

561
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:17,490
- Don't do that.
- Scared you, didn't I?

562
00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:21,035
There's scared,
and then there's surprised.

563
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:23,120
And you were both.

564
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:39,762
Nice try. You got a little spit right there.

565
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:46,268
- Kenai!
- You're not getting me this time.

566
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:47,728
No, look out.

567
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:53,734
No.

568
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:56,112
Come on.

569
00:52:10,585 --> 00:52:11,669
Kenai.

570
00:52:14,923 --> 00:52:16,715
Kenai, where are you?

571
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:29,645
Left. Left. No, the other left.

572
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,243
Kenai!

573
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:08,434
No!

574
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:15,357
What are you doing?
We got to get out of here.

575
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:26,387
Why do they hate us, Kenai?

576
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:28,597
- We're bears.
- So?

577
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:31,850
So, you know how they are.
They're killers.

578
00:54:31,893 --> 00:54:34,228
Wait a minute, who's the killers?

579
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:36,689
- Bears.
- What? Which bears?

580
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:38,899
I'm not like that, and you're not like that.

581
00:54:38,984 --> 00:54:42,027
Well, obviously not all bears.
I mean, you're okay.

582
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:46,490
Most bears will look for any excuse
to attack a human.

583
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:49,201
But, Kenai, he attacked us.

584
00:54:51,663 --> 00:54:54,206
You're just a cub.
When you're older, you'll understand.

585
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:57,376
Fish! Fish! Fish!

586
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,378
We made it. We're here.

587
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:01,755
- Come on!
- What? Koda.

588
00:55:01,881 --> 00:55:05,050
- Fish! Fish! Fish!
- Hey. Get away from me.

589
00:55:05,927 --> 00:55:08,345
Get away from me. Go on.

590
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:32,911
Hey, you're stirring up the water, dude.

591
00:55:32,954 --> 00:55:35,831
Yeah, try not to scare off
the fish there, buddy.

592
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:37,791
Tug.

593
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:40,544
Hey, Koda. Come here.

594
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:42,588
Look at you.

595
00:55:43,256 --> 00:55:47,259
- Have you seen my mom yet?
- No, as a matter of fact I haven't.

596
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:51,930
- Me and my friend Kenai beat her.
- He's with you?

597
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:54,475
Hi.

598
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:59,021
I've never seen you at the run before.

599
00:55:59,105 --> 00:56:02,900
- Where are you from?
- Well, I...

600
00:56:02,942 --> 00:56:05,861
There's the mountain,
just like I promised.

601
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:07,988
The lights touch the top every night.

602
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:11,825
Gonna be harder getting up there
than riding those mammoths.

603
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:13,619
- Mammoths?
- Are you kidding?

604
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:15,454
- That's weird.
- Yeah.

605
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:19,124
He does weird stuff.
Like the way he drinks water with a leaf.

606
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:22,961
He never sharpens his claws on a tree.
He's never hibernated before...

607
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:24,630
Koda. Koda.

608
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:28,634
Can I talk to you for a second?
Excuse us.

609
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:32,262
He's kind ofjumpy, isn't he?

610
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:34,139
Okay. Okay.

611
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:36,308
Koda, I...

612
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:41,063
- I got to get going.
- Well, when you come back...

613
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:43,315
I won't be coming back.

614
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,484
What? Why not?

615
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:49,988
Because... Well, it's hard to...

616
00:56:50,031 --> 00:56:52,282
- You're leaving?
- No.

617
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:54,118
Well, I mean, yes.

618
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:57,037
Well, it's just that I...

619
00:56:57,122 --> 00:57:00,499
- I don't belong here.
- Don't belong?

620
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:04,503
Every bear belongs here.
Come on, buddy.

621
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:05,754
Everyone's invited

622
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:07,005
Let's have some fun!

623
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:09,258
This is how we live

624
00:57:11,344 --> 00:57:13,595
We're all here for each other

625
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:17,266
Happy to give

626
00:57:19,018 --> 00:57:21,854
All we have, we share

627
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:25,732
And all of us, we care

628
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:27,192
So come on

629
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:31,029
Welcome to our family time

630
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:34,950
Welcome to our brotherly time

631
00:57:35,034 --> 00:57:40,038
We're happy giving and taking
to the friends we're making

632
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:42,708
There's nothing we won't do

633
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:45,627
Welcome to our family time

634
00:57:46,671 --> 00:57:50,424
Welcome to our happy-to-be time

635
00:57:50,508 --> 00:57:55,721
This is our festival
You know that best of all

636
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:58,682
We're here to share it all

637
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:04,271
There's a bond between us
nobody can explain

638
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:08,567
It's a celebration of life

639
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:11,236
And seeing friends again

640
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:16,366
I'd be there for you

641
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:19,703
I know you'd be there for me, too

642
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:25,250
- So come on
- Welcome to our family time

643
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:29,087
Welcome to our brotherly time

644
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:34,259
This is our festival
You know, and best of all

645
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:37,387
We're here to share it all

646
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:40,891
Remembering love once departed

647
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:44,603
Someone dear to your heart

648
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:48,315
Finding love, planning a future

649
00:58:48,399 --> 00:58:52,236
Telling stories
and laughing with friends

650
00:58:52,278 --> 00:58:55,489
Precious moments you'll never forget

651
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:59,952
This has to be the most beautiful

652
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:04,581
The most peaceful place
I've ever been to

653
00:59:05,166 --> 00:59:10,128
It's nothing like I've ever seen before

654
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:15,968
When I think how far I've come
I can't believe it

655
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:18,178
Yet I see it

656
00:59:18,846 --> 00:59:22,641
And then I see family

657
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:26,770
I see the way we used to be

658
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:32,985
- Come on
- Welcome to our family time

659
00:59:33,027 --> 00:59:36,863
Welcome to our brotherly time

660
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:41,952
We're happy giving and taking
to the friends that we're making

661
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:44,580
There's nothing we won't do

662
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:48,458
Welcome to our family time

663
00:59:48,501 --> 00:59:52,337
Welcome to our happy-to-be time

664
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:57,426
This is our festival
You know, and best of all

665
00:59:57,510 --> 00:59:59,886
You're here to share it

666
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:03,932
We're here to share it all

667
01:00:11,482 --> 01:00:15,694
All right, settle down, everyone.
Settle down. Hey.

668
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:18,488
Don't throw your fish bones there.
Somebody could choke on that.

669
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:20,365
Look, okay, I'll go first.

670
01:00:20,408 --> 01:00:25,037
Okay, let's see. The most interesting
thing that happened to me this year.

671
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:29,124
I know, I know, I know! Listen to this.

672
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:31,627
It was when I knocked down that tree

673
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:33,920
that was blocking the view
from my cave.

674
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:37,507
Now I got a family of chipmunks
staying in my place.

675
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:42,137
Yeah.

676
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:44,973
All right, everybody,
let me see some paws in the air.

677
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:48,101
- Who's gonna be next? Come on.
- Tug. I got one.

678
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:51,146
Watch me. Hey, gotcha.

679
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:56,109
This year I lost my dear husband Edgar.

680
01:00:56,194 --> 01:00:58,779
Quit telling everyone I'm dead!

681
01:00:58,863 --> 01:01:03,533
Sometimes I can still hear his voice.

682
01:01:03,576 --> 01:01:05,285
I'm getting the next one.

683
01:01:18,049 --> 01:01:19,966
Oh, yeah.

684
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:26,556
- This is it. I got it. I got...
- I guess it's our turn.

685
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:29,893
This is the year
I met the most gorgeous...

686
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:32,062
No, you're gorgeous.

687
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:35,774
- You're gorgeous-er.
- Get a cave.

688
01:01:37,443 --> 01:01:39,444
If only Edgar was alive...

689
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:42,114
I told you, woman, I'm right here!

690
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:46,243
- I love you, buttercup.
- This has got to be it.

691
01:01:46,285 --> 01:01:49,788
- Here you go, Koda.
- You gotta tell it, Kenai.

692
01:01:49,831 --> 01:01:52,999
- What?
- Yes. You caught it, you tell it.

693
01:01:53,084 --> 01:01:54,960
Didn't you play when you were a cub?

694
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:57,379
Come on, Keno.

695
01:02:00,299 --> 01:02:02,217
Okay, all right already. All right.

696
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:05,303
- You want to know what I did this year?
- Yes.

697
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:10,475
I went on the longest, hardest, most
exhausting journey I've ever been on

698
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:13,979
with the biggest pain in the neck
I've ever met.

699
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:18,316
What do you expect
from a little brother?

700
01:02:20,528 --> 01:02:22,529
Okay, buddy, your turn.

701
01:02:23,197 --> 01:02:26,199
- Let's hear it, Koda.
- Okay, okay, here we go.

702
01:02:27,785 --> 01:02:30,620
This year I watched my mom
in a life-and-death struggle

703
01:02:30,663 --> 01:02:33,498
battling the most fiercest creature ever.

704
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:35,208
- Who's next?
- What?

705
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:40,005
Wait a minute. I think we all want
to hear the rest of that one, Koda.

706
01:02:40,047 --> 01:02:43,717
I thought you might say that. Let's see.

707
01:02:43,801 --> 01:02:48,346
It was probably the fifth or sixth
most coldest day in my entire life.

708
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:51,516
Me and Mom were eating fish,
having a great time.

709
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:56,563
All of a sudden she pushes me into
the bushes and tells me to be real quiet.

710
01:02:56,939 --> 01:03:00,484
She says, "I smell something."
So I started sniffing.

711
01:03:01,527 --> 01:03:04,196
There's something in the woods
running towards us,

712
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:06,782
getting closer and closer.

713
01:03:08,534 --> 01:03:12,537
And then, out of the trees,
jumps a hunter.

714
01:03:14,415 --> 01:03:17,334
And now there's nowhere for Mom to go.

715
01:03:17,376 --> 01:03:21,129
The monster has her backed up
against this giant glacier.

716
01:03:25,551 --> 01:03:29,221
The monster attacks,
but Mom's too quick for him.

717
01:03:29,263 --> 01:03:34,851
And before he can do it again, she
stands up real big and yells, "Go away."

718
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:36,812
Kenai.

719
01:03:36,896 --> 01:03:38,647
Mom smells more of them.

720
01:03:38,731 --> 01:03:40,732
There's a whole pack
coming right at us.

721
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:43,235
Sitka, no. The bear. Behind you.

722
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:45,654
She runs to stop them
before they get to me.

723
01:03:45,738 --> 01:03:48,782
They're all around her,
poking her with sticks.

724
01:03:48,866 --> 01:03:52,661
- Sitka.
- The whole thing broke and fell off.

725
01:03:52,745 --> 01:03:54,579
There was ice everywhere.

726
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:57,374
She couldn't hold her breath
any longer, and pow.

727
01:03:57,416 --> 01:04:01,419
She bursts out of the water.
I've never been so scared in my life.

728
01:04:01,712 --> 01:04:04,631
- I'm going after the bear.
- Koda?

729
01:04:04,715 --> 01:04:06,591
- Sitka wouldn't want it.
- Sitka's not here

730
01:04:06,634 --> 01:04:08,718
because of that monster.

731
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:14,432
Fell off a glacier?
I've never seen anything like that.

732
01:04:14,475 --> 01:04:15,642
Can you imagine?

733
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:19,938
Kenai. What's the matter, Kenai?

734
01:04:20,022 --> 01:04:22,649
- What happened next?
- Was she okay?

735
01:04:23,776 --> 01:04:27,153
Hey, Kenai, what's wrong?
Where you going?

736
01:04:27,238 --> 01:04:30,448
She got out of the water okay.
That's how we got separated.

737
01:04:30,491 --> 01:04:33,451
Right after that I met Kenai.

738
01:04:33,494 --> 01:04:34,661
Kenai?

739
01:05:20,499 --> 01:05:23,168
Scared you again, huh?

740
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:25,128
- Yeah.
- Where have you been?

741
01:05:25,171 --> 01:05:26,796
- You look horrible.
- Koda...

742
01:05:26,839 --> 01:05:29,841
My mom says when
you eat too much fish, just lie down.

743
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:34,262
There's something I...

744
01:05:35,264 --> 01:05:37,432
You know that story
you told me last night?

745
01:05:37,516 --> 01:05:40,810
- Yeah.
- Well, I have a story to tell you.

746
01:05:40,853 --> 01:05:43,188
Really? What's it about?

747
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:46,399
Well, it's kind of about a man,

748
01:05:46,484 --> 01:05:49,069
and kind of about a bear.

749
01:05:49,153 --> 01:05:52,197
But mostly it's about a monster.

750
01:05:53,532 --> 01:05:55,492
A monster who did something so bad...

751
01:05:55,534 --> 01:05:59,913
Everywhere I turn I hurt someone

752
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:06,878
But there's nothing I can say
to change the things I've done

753
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:11,591
I'd do anything within my power

754
01:06:11,676 --> 01:06:14,803
I'd give everything I've got

755
01:06:14,887 --> 01:06:19,474
But the path I seek
is hidden from me now

756
01:06:19,558 --> 01:06:22,769
Koda, I did something very wrong.

757
01:06:22,853 --> 01:06:27,023
Brother bear, I let you down

758
01:06:27,066 --> 01:06:28,775
I don't like this story.

759
01:06:28,859 --> 01:06:33,863
You trusted me, believed in me
and I let you down

760
01:06:33,906 --> 01:06:35,573
Your mother's not coming.

761
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:38,994
Of all the things I hid from you

762
01:06:39,078 --> 01:06:41,830
I cannot hide the shame

763
01:06:41,914 --> 01:06:43,081
And I pray someone

764
01:06:43,124 --> 01:06:44,249
No. No!

765
01:06:44,291 --> 01:06:49,587
Something will come
to take away the pain

766
01:06:50,297 --> 01:06:53,758
There's no way out

767
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:57,095
Of this dark place

768
01:06:57,179 --> 01:07:00,724
No, no future

769
01:07:04,103 --> 01:07:09,441
I know I can't be free

770
01:07:11,652 --> 01:07:15,280
But I can't see another way

771
01:07:16,782 --> 01:07:21,619
And I can't face another day

772
01:07:24,373 --> 01:07:27,333
Koda? Koda?

773
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:31,129
Koda!

774
01:07:35,342 --> 01:07:36,968
Koda, I wish I could...

775
01:07:38,095 --> 01:07:40,805
If there was just some way...

776
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:43,558
I'd give anything if...

777
01:07:46,687 --> 01:07:49,189
If I could just...

778
01:08:00,993 --> 01:08:03,328
I'm sorry, Koda.

779
01:08:03,954 --> 01:08:05,663
I'm so sorry.

780
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:44,911
I'm sorry, Kenai.

781
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:47,705
I don't know what I'm doing any more.

782
01:08:48,749 --> 01:08:50,750
I need help.

783
01:09:04,932 --> 01:09:06,432
Sitka.

784
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:18,862
Look, I am sorry.

785
01:09:18,904 --> 01:09:20,905
If I was driving
this never would have happened.

786
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:26,327
- You never let me do nothing.
- Trample off. I said sorry. Let it go.

787
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:28,705
I can't believe you totalled a mammoth.

788
01:09:28,747 --> 01:09:32,333
- That mountain came out of nowhere.
- I cannot accept your apology.

789
01:09:32,418 --> 01:09:36,171
- It was in my blind spot...
- Look. It's that little cub.

790
01:09:37,214 --> 01:09:40,258
- Something's bugging him.
- What's wrong, smallish bear?

791
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:42,927
Nothing. I'm fine.

792
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:48,391
Good. Where were we? Oh, yeah.
You're a big, selfish, reckless hoofer.

793
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:50,518
- What?
- I'm fed up with it.

794
01:09:50,769 --> 01:09:54,272
- From now on, he's my new brother.
- You can't do that.

795
01:09:54,356 --> 01:09:57,942
Sorry, you've been replaced
with my dear brother...

796
01:09:57,985 --> 01:09:59,819
What's your name again?

797
01:09:59,904 --> 01:10:02,280
I don't want any more brothers.

798
01:10:02,364 --> 01:10:06,201
- See? He's had enough of you, too.
- I promise I'll change.

799
01:10:06,285 --> 01:10:10,038
Trample off. You won't.
Being a brother means nothing to you.

800
01:10:10,122 --> 01:10:12,415
- Of course it does.
- Like what?

801
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:14,959
What about when your hooves
froze in the pond?

802
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:18,546
- Who sat with you all winter, eh?
- You did.

803
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:20,798
Who showed you
where the good grazing is?

804
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:24,302
The really tender stuff
all covered in dew.

805
01:10:24,386 --> 01:10:27,055
Now, why do you think I did that, eh?

806
01:10:27,139 --> 01:10:29,098
Because I...

807
01:10:29,141 --> 01:10:32,060
Because I love... dew.

808
01:10:32,144 --> 01:10:35,605
Excuse me?
I don't believe I heard what you said.

809
01:10:35,731 --> 01:10:38,733
I said, "I love dew."

810
01:10:39,401 --> 01:10:41,736
I love dew, too.

811
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:45,490
Hey, I can change.

812
01:10:45,532 --> 01:10:48,952
- Go away.
- Come on, I can change.

813
01:10:48,994 --> 01:10:52,747
- Go away, don't touch me.
- I can change.

814
01:10:52,831 --> 01:10:54,582
Hey. No.

815
01:10:54,667 --> 01:10:56,709
Not there, that's the spot.

816
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:00,463
Like, we'll see you later, smallish bear.

817
01:11:00,506 --> 01:11:04,425
Yeah, good day.
You know what this calls for?

818
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:08,888
A pile of delicious barley and amber
weed on a cool bed of malted hops.

819
01:11:08,973 --> 01:11:10,974
I like it.

820
01:11:27,449 --> 01:11:30,034
Sitka! Sitka, are you there?

821
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:32,829
Sitka?

822
01:11:34,164 --> 01:11:38,376
Please. Please, Sitka.

823
01:11:38,419 --> 01:11:40,420
I don't know what else to do.

824
01:11:44,717 --> 01:11:45,967
Sitka.

825
01:11:52,891 --> 01:11:54,142
Denahi.

826
01:11:56,228 --> 01:11:58,229
Sitka, hurry, change me back.

827
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:12,577
Where are you, Sitka?

828
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:36,768
Denahi.

829
01:12:38,312 --> 01:12:39,937
Denahi, please.

830
01:12:44,443 --> 01:12:45,568
Koda.

831
01:12:56,705 --> 01:12:58,206
No!

832
01:13:00,292 --> 01:13:01,876
Leave him alone.

833
01:13:04,963 --> 01:13:06,297
Koda!

834
01:13:32,199 --> 01:13:33,825
Kenai?

835
01:13:51,051 --> 01:13:52,593
Sitka?

836
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:21,372
Koda, don't be afraid. It's me.

837
01:15:09,046 --> 01:15:11,088
He needs me.

838
01:15:12,758 --> 01:15:16,260
You know, he did look better as a bear.

839
01:15:26,271 --> 01:15:29,482
But, Denahi...

840
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:32,068
It's all right, Kenai.

841
01:15:39,826 --> 01:15:44,205
No matter what you choose,
you'll always be my little brother.

842
01:16:04,184 --> 01:16:05,518
Did I say little?

843
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:41,220
Kenai.

844
01:17:07,539 --> 01:17:12,627
My brother Kenai went on to live
with Koda and the other bears.

845
01:17:12,711 --> 01:17:16,505
He taught me
that love is very powerful.

846
01:17:17,591 --> 01:17:21,302
And I passed on the wisdom
of his story to our people.

847
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:25,723
The story of a boy who became a man

848
01:17:26,516 --> 01:17:28,559
by becoming a bear.

849
01:17:28,977 --> 01:17:32,063
Great spirits of all who lived before

850
01:17:32,105 --> 01:17:34,899
Take our hands and lead us

851
01:17:34,941 --> 01:17:40,029
Fill our hearts and souls
with all you know

852
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:43,199
Show us that in your eyes

853
01:17:43,241 --> 01:17:46,035
We are all the same

854
01:17:46,078 --> 01:17:51,290
Brothers to each other
in this world we remain

855
01:17:51,375 --> 01:17:54,335
Truly brothers all the same

856
01:17:54,419 --> 01:17:59,382
Brothers all the same

857
01:18:11,728 --> 01:18:14,563
So, like, what are you doing there,
smallish bear?

858
01:18:14,606 --> 01:18:17,233
I'm practising my moves.
Want to see one?

859
01:18:17,275 --> 01:18:19,860
Sure. This ought to be good?

860
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:28,994
Listen to me. I was a man
that was changed into a bear.

861
01:18:29,079 --> 01:18:32,498
No beaver. Man into bear. That's it.

862
01:18:32,582 --> 01:18:36,627
Yeah, so, before that
you was probably like a goat?

863
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:38,963
- What about a water buffalo?
- No, he's a rabbit.

864
01:18:39,005 --> 01:18:42,466
Look at his ears and furry feet.
Watch out for the rabbit, eh.

865
01:18:42,509 --> 01:18:43,801
No way, eh.

866
01:18:43,844 --> 01:18:47,680
Okay, now, everyone, take a big inhale.

867
01:18:47,764 --> 01:18:49,223
And then on...

868
01:18:49,307 --> 01:18:53,519
On the exhale,
shift into salutation to the sun.

869
01:18:56,148 --> 01:19:01,736
No, you shut up.

870
01:19:10,787 --> 01:19:13,998
- How you doing over there, Koda?
- Pretty good.

871
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:32,524
In accordance with all federal
and state wildlife regulations,

872
01:24:32,609 --> 01:24:35,277
no fish were harmed
during the making of this film.

873
01:24:37,363 --> 01:24:39,656
No! He's gonna eat me!

874
01:24:41,826 --> 01:24:43,368
Cut. Cut.

875
01:24:43,953 --> 01:24:46,580
Somebody, help me.
Help me. Somebody.

875
01:24:47,305 --> 01:25:47,628
