Same reason anybody
does anything.

31
00:02:03,727 --> 00:02:05,694
The money.

00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:10,303

00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,213
That's what does it for me.

36
00:02:19,248 --> 00:02:22,843
Ah, the look. Yeah, that look.

37
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:25,076
Lasts about two seconds.

38
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:27,353
As soon as they're finished
unwrapping,

39
00:02:27,388 --> 00:02:29,916
they want the next present,

40
00:02:29,951 --> 00:02:32,589
they want the next cool thing.

41
00:02:32,624 --> 00:02:34,591
That's how this world works.

42
00:02:34,626 --> 00:02:36,692
And kids...
What kids have become.

43
00:02:36,727 --> 00:02:40,894
They're just like
little junkies.

44
00:02:40,929 --> 00:02:43,501
They're little shits.
They just demand.

45
00:02:43,536 --> 00:02:45,162
They don't believe.

46
00:02:45,197 --> 00:02:48,770
They just want, crave, consume.

47
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:56,173
Maybe this is my last year.

48
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,287
The last Christmas.

49
00:03:04,084 --> 00:03:07,591
Well, I can't stand seeing
another Santa in distress.

50
00:03:08,825 --> 00:03:10,363
Put his drinks on my tab.

51
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:11,925
- Okay?
- Yeah.

52
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,466
Oh, very merry of you. Okay.

53
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:16,963
I better get going.

54
00:03:16,998 --> 00:03:18,965
Presents aren't gonna
deliver themselves.

55
00:03:20,232 --> 00:03:22,276
Oh, uh...

56
00:03:22,311 --> 00:03:24,135

Save me a trip.

00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,203

Merry Christmas.

61
00:03:32,321 --> 00:03:34,651
How'd he know
my grandson's name?

62
00:03:34,686 --> 00:03:37,951
How'd he know I have
a grandson? -

63
00:03:37,986 --> 00:03:42,054
Oi! That door leads to the roof.

64
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:43,462
Piss head.

65
00:03:43,497 --> 00:03:45,959
Go easy on him. It's Christmas.

66
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:51,602
Hey! You can't be up here.

67
00:03:51,637 --> 00:03:55,166

I'm the one...

68

80
00:05:39,778 --> 00:05:41,844
She got to stay up late
and watch<i> Home Alone.</i>

Uh-huh.

82
00:05:42,946 --> 00:05:45,848
It was so funny.

83
00:05:45,883 --> 00:05:48,378

Thank you.

86
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,758

87
00:05:54,793 --> 00:05:56,826
I'm not doing it for you.

Hi, Linda. Merry Christmas.

91

- Mr. Lightstone.

92
00:06:25,527 --> 00:06:26,955
Hey, you back there, Tru?

93
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,627
Yeah, I bet you're excited
for Christmas.

94
00:06:28,662 --> 00:06:30,563
What did you ask Santa for?

95
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,224
Not to work on Christmas Eve.

96
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:33,731
Must've been naughty this year,

97
00:06:33,766 --> 00:06:35,502
- 'cause here I am.
- Mm-hmm.

98
00:06:35,537 --> 00:06:37,504
Just make sure you let Santa
through the gates later, Al.

99
00:06:37,539 --> 00:06:38,934
- Yeah.
- Have a merry one, now.

100
00:06:38,969 --> 00:06:40,936
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, Al.

101
00:06:40,971 --> 00:06:42,971
Merry Christmas, Tru.

102
00:06:43,006 --> 00:06:44,401
- Thank you, Al.
- Yeah.

103
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:09,899
I can't remember
where the second one is.

104
00:07:13,201 --> 00:07:15,036
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

105

That doesn't go over there.

108
00:07:29,514 --> 00:07:31,283
Excuse me.

109
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:37,322

Shall we jockey forward?

181
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,459
No.

182
00:11:01,693 --> 00:11:04,166
No, we can hang back.

183
00:11:04,201 --> 00:11:05,695
Yeah.

184
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:07,268
Trudy, honey?

185
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,436
Come on over here.

186
00:11:11,813 --> 00:11:14,011
Just, like...

187
00:11:14,046 --> 00:11:15,749
Threaten 'em or bribe 'em.

188
00:11:15,784 --> 00:11:17,080
This isn't rocket science.

189
00:11:17,115 --> 00:11:18,576
Same shit we always do.

190
00:11:20,217 --> 00:11:21,579
That's what?

191
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:23,889
That's the best you can do?

192
00:11:23,924 --> 00:11:25,759
Excited to see your grandma?

193
00:11:25,794 --> 00:11:27,189
Listen, you cocksucker.

194
00:11:27,224 --> 00:11:29,092
It's Christmas,
so why don't you take

195
00:11:29,127 --> 00:11:31,028
your best offer, gift wrap it,

196
00:11:31,063 --> 00:11:33,965
and ram it up your fucking box.

197
00:11:35,397 --> 00:11:37,771
Maybe you don't
realize who I am.

198
00:11:37,806 --> 00:11:39,267
Those were Grandma words.
You know, forget them.

199
00:11:39,302 --> 00:11:41,071
Oh, boy.
Look at Mr. Cool back here.

200
00:11:41,106 --> 00:11:43,370
Yeah, what's your angle, man?
Hmm?

201
00:11:43,405 --> 00:11:45,911
No angle.
I'm not doing anything.

202
00:11:45,946 --> 00:11:47,473
Oh, yeah.

203
00:11:47,508 --> 00:11:49,244
No, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no. No!

204
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,049
Don't shit in my mouth
and tell me it's chocolate cake.

205
00:11:52,084 --> 00:11:53,380
Grandma's cool.

206
00:11:53,415 --> 00:11:55,745
I can make that story go away...

207
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,417
I think your brother's
up to something.

208
00:11:57,452 --> 00:11:59,122
No, I just decided
to let you guys

209
00:11:59,157 --> 00:12:00,959
have all the fun
sucking up to Mom today.

210
00:12:00,994 --> 00:12:03,720
Please. You are King Suck-up.

211
00:12:03,755 --> 00:12:05,755
You named your kid Gertrude.

212
00:12:07,297 --> 00:12:09,396
Alva, you named
your son Bertrude.

213
00:12:09,431 --> 00:12:11,596
Okay.

214
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:13,499
Sorry, Bert,
but that's not a real name.

215
00:12:13,534 --> 00:12:16,073
Sorry, Linda. We can't all be
lucky enough to have daughters.

216
00:12:16,108 --> 00:12:17,844
Mom, I can hear you.

217
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:21,672
You know something we don't.
What is it?

218
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:23,278
No, I don't. I don't.

219
00:12:23,313 --> 00:12:24,576
I got it. Bingo.

220
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:25,852
I'm onto you, man. Come on!

221
00:12:25,887 --> 00:12:27,612
- We were just...
- Come on,

222
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:28,954
come on, come on, come on.

223
00:12:28,989 --> 00:12:31,088
- You big sack of shit.
- Ooh.

224
00:12:31,123 --> 00:12:32,859
No wonder your husband left you.

225
00:12:32,894 --> 00:12:34,960
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

226
00:12:36,227 --> 00:12:38,458
Merry Christmas to you, too,
Senator.

227
00:12:39,461 --> 00:12:41,164
- Merry Christmas, Mommy.
- Merry Christmas.

228
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:44,299
Merry Christmas.

229
00:12:44,334 --> 00:12:46,730
Why in the hell are you standing
all the way back there?

230
00:12:47,876 --> 00:12:49,766
Merry Christmas, Grandma!

231
00:12:49,801 --> 00:12:51,878
- Aw.
- Little bitch.

232
00:12:51,913 --> 00:12:54,309
Little Gertrude. And how is
my favorite granddaughter?

233
00:12:54,344 --> 00:12:56,707
Everybody calls me Trudy now.

234
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:58,346
Trudy?

235
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:02,152
-Well, that makes her
sound like a whore. -Okay.

236
00:13:02,187 --> 00:13:04,550
Oh, she doesn't even know
the meaning of the word.

237
00:13:04,585 --> 00:13:06,992
I'm starving. Let's eat.

238
00:13:07,027 --> 00:13:08,554
Great.

239
00:13:08,589 --> 00:13:10,963
And, Mom, I think Gertrude
is a beautiful name.

240
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:13,328
Mm-hmm.
I only call her Gertrude.

241
00:13:13,363 --> 00:13:14,659

<i>I made these all by myself.</i>

<i>- No way.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

263
00:14:29,175 --> 00:14:31,142
I even made one
that looks exactly like Santa.

264
00:14:31,177 --> 00:14:33,573
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

265
00:14:34,576 --> 00:14:35,982
Santa gets a candy cane, too?

266
00:14:36,017 --> 00:14:37,280
Yeah.

267
00:14:37,315 --> 00:14:38,677
Mm, okay.

268
00:14:40,186 --> 00:14:41,746
It's perfect.

269
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:43,550
No peeking.

270
00:14:43,585 --> 00:14:45,882
This house has so many chimneys.

271
00:14:47,523 --> 00:14:49,589
How will Santa know
which one to come down?

272
00:14:49,624 --> 00:14:51,426
Oh, Santa just knows.

273
00:14:51,461 --> 00:14:52,966
Christmas magic.

274
00:14:56,136 --> 00:14:57,971
Honey, what's wrong?

275
00:14:58,006 --> 00:15:01,139
Daddy never took me to see
Santa at the mall this year.

276
00:15:02,142 --> 00:15:04,175
He didn't.

277
00:15:06,641 --> 00:15:08,641
I am so sorry.

278
00:15:10,612 --> 00:15:12,513
This year has been weird.

279
00:15:12,548 --> 00:15:16,187
I never got to tell Santa
what I wanted for Christmas.

280
00:15:16,222 --> 00:15:18,552
Oh, honey. Come here.

281
00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:24,921
You know what?

282
00:15:24,956 --> 00:15:29,200
You go put your pj's on,

283
00:15:29,235 --> 00:15:32,071
and I will be two minutes.

284
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,178
Yes!

285
00:15:41,742 --> 00:15:44,281
Okay...

286
00:15:52,192 --> 00:15:53,785
Yes.

287
00:15:57,593 --> 00:15:59,428
Yes!

288
00:16:01,234 --> 00:16:05,500
Because you have been so good
to me and Mommy this year,

289
00:16:05,535 --> 00:16:09,471
we decided that
you could have one gift...

290
00:16:09,506 --> 00:16:11,308
early!

291
00:16:11,343 --> 00:16:13,607
Really?

292
00:16:17,712 --> 00:16:19,778
What is it?

293
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:25,388
That is a very special
walkie-talkie.

294
00:16:25,423 --> 00:16:26,818
It's magic.

295
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:28,193
- Magic?
- Mm-hmm.

296
00:16:28,228 --> 00:16:30,492
What you got right there

297
00:16:30,527 --> 00:16:32,923
is a direct hotline
to Santa Claus himself.

298
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,596
- I can talk to Santa?
- Oh, yeah.

299
00:16:35,631 --> 00:16:39,402
It's just like writing him
a letter... but better.

300
00:16:39,437 --> 00:16:40,568
Mm-hmm.

301
00:16:40,603 --> 00:16:43,340
Now, the only thing is,

302
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,771
he might not have time
to answer you.

303
00:16:45,806 --> 00:16:47,575
He's delivering a lot
of presents tonight.

304
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:49,181
Mm-hmm.

305
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:51,546
But he'll hear everything
you want to say to him.

306
00:16:58,082 --> 00:16:59,884
Hello, Santa?

307
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:03,360
This is Trudy Lightstone.

308
00:17:03,395 --> 00:17:05,527
I hope you're having
a nice night.

309
00:17:05,562 --> 00:17:07,694
Mm.

310
00:17:07,729 --> 00:17:12,171
It's really cold tonight,
so don't forget your mittens.

311
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,571
So, I wanted to tell you, Santa,

312
00:17:16,606 --> 00:17:18,573
I was extra good this year,

313
00:17:18,608 --> 00:17:22,280
so I wrote a big list for you
with all the stuff I wanted.

314
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,778
But then...

315
00:17:25,813 --> 00:17:29,089
then I realized
I don't need any of that.

316
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:33,621
I really only want
one present for Christmas.

317
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,989
I want Mommy and Daddy
to make up

318
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:41,299
so we can be a family again.

319
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:44,401
Okay.

320
00:17:44,436 --> 00:17:46,370
Good night, Santa.

321
00:17:47,835 --> 00:17:49,769
Good night, Mr. Bunny.

322
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:03,948
Which one of you did that?

323
00:18:05,358 --> 00:18:06,786
You can't go two seconds without

324
00:18:06,821 --> 00:18:08,524
crapping on the roof
like a bunch of pigeons?

325
00:18:10,231 --> 00:18:13,133
So unprofessional.

326
00:18:16,127 --> 00:18:18,501
You know, Rudolph
will never do this crap.

327
00:18:31,747 --> 00:18:33,384
Hmm.

328
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,489
Mmm.

329
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,366
Mmm, mmm.

330
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,732
Homemade.

331
00:18:51,767 --> 00:18:53,239
Mmm.

332
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:59,036
Ugh.

333
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:00,543
Skim.

334
00:19:10,885 --> 00:19:12,555
Oh, yeah.

335
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,524
That's the stuff.

336
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:20,926
Mmm.

337
00:19:21,929 --> 00:19:23,863
DuBoi...

338
00:19:23,898 --> 00:19:26,866
- On some prewar shit
right there. -

339
00:19:26,901 --> 00:19:29,132
Good shit.

340
00:19:40,915 --> 00:19:42,420
Mmm.

341
00:19:42,455 --> 00:19:44,015
That pairs well.

342
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,655
What do we have here?

343
00:20:02,937 --> 00:20:04,772
Oh, yeah.

344
00:20:04,807 --> 00:20:06,675
That's the stuff.

345
00:20:15,818 --> 00:20:18,885
You know, uh...

346
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,888
Christmas is all right,

347
00:20:21,923 --> 00:20:25,298
but you Americans don't
celebrate my favorite holiday.

348
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:28,092
Oh, yeah? What?

349
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:29,632
Boxing Day.

350
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:04,766
Yo, yo. B. Lightstone here,

351
00:21:04,801 --> 00:21:06,471
live streaming the dream,
you know.

352
00:21:06,506 --> 00:21:08,968
They say the richest man...

353
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:11,872
Say goodbye.

354
00:21:11,907 --> 00:21:13,643
And if you...

355
00:21:15,075 --> 00:21:17,812
Grandma! Your Wi-Fi sucks dick.

356
00:21:17,847 --> 00:21:19,649
Damn it!

357
00:21:19,684 --> 00:21:22,113
When he was small,
I begged you to beat him.

358
00:21:39,737 --> 00:21:41,704
Hey. Merry Christmas.

359
00:21:41,739 --> 00:21:43,541
Or should I say
"happy holidays" now?

360
00:21:43,576 --> 00:21:45,576
Right? I mean, it's like,
people, make up your minds.

361
00:21:45,611 --> 00:21:47,677
- You know what I'm saying?
- Can I help you?

362
00:21:47,712 --> 00:21:49,646
Oh, yeah. I sure hope so.
See, uh,

363
00:21:49,681 --> 00:21:51,417
my car broke down
a little ways...

364
00:21:51,452 --> 00:21:53,177
Out here?
This is a private road.

365
00:21:53,212 --> 00:21:55,179
You're telling me.

366
00:21:55,214 --> 00:21:57,313
It's the first place
I've seen for miles.

367
00:21:57,348 --> 00:21:58,688
I think I got frostbite.

368
00:21:58,723 --> 00:22:00,085
Where the hell am I, anyway?

369
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,757
G.T. Lightstone family compound.

370
00:22:01,792 --> 00:22:03,363
I'll call you a tow.

371
00:22:12,704 --> 00:22:14,671
All right, revelers.

372
00:22:14,706 --> 00:22:16,409
Time to steal Christmas.

373
00:22:16,444 --> 00:22:17,707
Sound off.

374
00:22:17,742 --> 00:22:19,203
Jingle. Check.

375
00:22:19,238 --> 00:22:20,908
Peppermint. Check.

376
00:22:20,943 --> 00:22:22,371
Sugarplum. Check.

377
00:22:22,406 --> 00:22:25,341
Krampus. Ready to fuck shit up.

378
00:22:25,376 --> 00:22:27,343
Candy Cane. Check.

379
00:22:27,378 --> 00:22:29,884
- Go for Frosty.
- Go for Tinsel.

380
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,754
Go for Gingerbread.

381
00:22:31,789 --> 00:22:34,460
Are we gonna use these stupid
code names all night?

382
00:22:34,495 --> 00:22:36,088
'Tis the season.

383
00:22:36,123 --> 00:22:39,795
Welcome to your worst
Christmas ever.

384
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:43,095
Trudy loves seeing Santa
at the mall.

385
00:22:44,131 --> 00:22:45,867
She loves going with her father.

386
00:22:45,902 --> 00:22:47,440
And you should've
taken her yesterday,

387
00:22:47,475 --> 00:22:48,903
like you do every Christmas,

388
00:22:48,938 --> 00:22:50,542
but we didn't even
hear from you.

389
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:51,939
Mom put me on a special project.

390
00:22:51,974 --> 00:22:53,479
- It's complicated.
- But it's not,

391
00:22:53,514 --> 00:22:55,580
because it keeps happening
over and over.

392
00:22:55,615 --> 00:22:57,846
-Your mother forcing herself
between us. -You're right.

393
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,985
What if we could give Trudy
her Christmas wish?

394
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,119
You're trying to win me back

395
00:23:07,154 --> 00:23:09,726
with a romantic weekend
at your mother's?

396
00:23:09,761 --> 00:23:12,927
What if things
really changed this time?

397
00:23:14,832 --> 00:23:17,129
We got out from under
my mother's thumb.

398
00:23:17,164 --> 00:23:19,131
We'll walk away.

399
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:21,540
From the company, the family.

400
00:23:24,435 --> 00:23:25,973
Tonight.

401
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:28,338
What are you up to?

402
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:15,055
Let's go.

403
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:17,453
We need to get you out of here.

404
00:24:17,488 --> 00:24:19,389
Mommy, where are you going?

405
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:21,127
- She's going for the panic room!
- What?

406
00:24:21,162 --> 00:24:22,568
- Yes. Go, Bertrude.
- Without us?

407
00:24:28,499 --> 00:24:30,367
Fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck.

408
00:24:52,193 --> 00:24:54,094
There isn't room for all of us.

409
00:24:54,129 --> 00:24:55,832
She can fit at least two of us.
Mom, take me.

410
00:24:55,867 --> 00:24:57,768
- Mom!
- Oh. Yeah.

411
00:24:57,803 --> 00:24:59,528
M-Mom, can Bert come, too?

412
00:25:02,137 --> 00:25:03,433
Okay. Move it or lose it, son.

413
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:05,072
- Move it!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

414
00:25:05,107 --> 00:25:07,239
You're supposed to protect us.

415
00:25:07,274 --> 00:25:08,614
We protect the primary asset.

416
00:25:12,785 --> 00:25:14,048
Who the hell are you?

417
00:25:14,083 --> 00:25:16,754
You can call me Mr. Scrooge.

418
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:18,954
Hilarious.

419
00:25:18,989 --> 00:25:20,384
Get him.

420
00:25:29,098 --> 00:25:31,329
Bah humbug, motherfucker.

421
00:25:40,846 --> 00:25:42,912
Hey. Step aside.

422
00:25:44,443 --> 00:25:46,817
Tinsel, Peppermint,
sweep upstairs.

423
00:25:46,852 --> 00:25:48,852
I want all the Lightstones
together.

424
00:25:49,822 --> 00:25:51,481
Kill anybody else you find.

425
00:26:01,702 --> 00:26:04,461
Fuck. Fuck, fuck.

426
00:26:05,464 --> 00:26:07,673
Trudy, honey, we got to go.

427
00:26:08,841 --> 00:26:10,500
Wake up, honey. Wake up.

428
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:13,008
Maybe we can get out the back
by the servants' stairs.

429
00:26:20,116 --> 00:26:22,446
Oh, come on. Not now. Not now.

430
00:26:23,614 --> 00:26:25,581
Fuck! Fuck!

431
00:26:25,616 --> 00:26:27,253
Mistletoe, gingerbread.

432
00:26:51,312 --> 00:26:52,344
Hey!

433
00:26:55,184 --> 00:26:56,480
Oh. Oh.

434
00:26:56,515 --> 00:26:58,020
Hi.

435
00:26:58,055 --> 00:27:00,616
You got me.

436
00:27:00,651 --> 00:27:03,058
I don't want any trouble, okay?

437
00:27:03,093 --> 00:27:04,895
Downstairs. Now.

438
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:08,558
Look, mister,
I don't want to get involved.

439
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:10,835
I just...
I just have a job to do.

440
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:12,331
Okay? That's it.

441
00:27:12,366 --> 00:27:14,905
I'm just gonna take my bag,

442
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:17,468
and I'm just gonna
scooch up that chimney.

443
00:27:19,109 --> 00:27:20,746
Enough talk. Let's go.

444
00:27:21,749 --> 00:27:23,375
You don't want to do this.

445
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:24,640
What? This?

446
00:27:26,347 --> 00:27:27,720
Now, move!

447
00:27:27,755 --> 00:27:29,678
Are you deaf?

448
00:27:29,713 --> 00:27:31,724
Fucking move!

449
00:27:42,462 --> 00:27:44,330
No, no, no.

450
00:27:44,365 --> 00:27:47,498
No! Wait!

451
00:27:47,533 --> 00:27:48,939
Wait.

452
00:27:48,974 --> 00:27:50,501
Wait! Don't go!

453
00:27:50,536 --> 00:27:52,404
Come back!

454
00:29:07,481 --> 00:29:09,151
Oh, fuck!

455
00:29:33,309 --> 00:29:34,880
Oh, shit.

456
00:29:56,266 --> 00:29:59,872
Damn chickenshit reindeer
leave me here to die.

457
00:30:08,608 --> 00:30:11,675
♪ Violent night ♪

458
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:14,744
♪ Gory night ♪

459
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:17,219
♪ All is calm ♪

460
00:30:17,254 --> 00:30:21,058
♪ If all doesn't want to get
shot in the fucking head. ♪

461
00:30:22,061 --> 00:30:23,489
Cute.

462
00:30:23,524 --> 00:30:26,426
Do you have any idea
who you're fucking with?

463
00:30:30,102 --> 00:30:32,938
I know exactly
who I'm fucking with.

464
00:30:32,973 --> 00:30:34,830
Oh, wait, wait.
Did you actually think

465
00:30:34,865 --> 00:30:36,502
that I spent months

466
00:30:36,537 --> 00:30:39,109
planning a complex break-in
to the most secure

467
00:30:39,144 --> 00:30:40,869
private residence in the country

468
00:30:40,904 --> 00:30:42,574
and I didn't know
who lived here?

469
00:30:42,609 --> 00:30:44,048
Well, you're wrong.

470
00:30:44,083 --> 00:30:47,018
'Cause your staff are dead.

471
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:49,185
Your security are dead.

472
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:52,320
Now, sit down
and shut the fuck up!

473
00:31:20,449 --> 00:31:22,482
Oh, fuck.

474
00:31:25,586 --> 00:31:26,992
We planned it. It's all right.

475
00:31:27,027 --> 00:31:28,488
It'll be solved
in a couple minutes.

476
00:31:28,523 --> 00:31:30,160
Better be solved.

477
00:31:30,195 --> 00:31:32,426
So much like a scene
from my movie<i> Dark Ransom.</i>

478
00:31:32,461 --> 00:31:33,790
Oh, my God.

479
00:31:35,002 --> 00:31:36,595
If they didn't have guns,

480
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:38,630
I could take out three,
maybe four of them.

481
00:31:38,665 --> 00:31:40,566
Try all of them.

482
00:31:40,601 --> 00:31:43,305
Ew, Mom. Yuck.

483
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,307
If you'd really done
your research, you'd know

484
00:31:45,342 --> 00:31:47,837
that my brother Rory
was kidnapped in the '70s.

485
00:31:48,939 --> 00:31:51,445
But my father
never called the police.

486
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,085
Dad sent in our own
private extraction team,

487
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:57,517
and Rory was home
safe and sound a week later.

488
00:31:57,552 --> 00:32:01,125
And the kidnappers
were never found.

489
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,028
If you get me.

490
00:32:04,691 --> 00:32:06,295
I know.

491
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:09,166
I know all about
your extraction team

492
00:32:09,201 --> 00:32:11,036
that you affectionately call
"the Kill Squad"

493
00:32:11,071 --> 00:32:13,038
behind closed doors.

494
00:32:13,073 --> 00:32:14,930
I also know
that they're on their way

495
00:32:14,965 --> 00:32:16,932
and how long it's gonna
take 'em to get here.

496
00:32:16,967 --> 00:32:19,605
I even know their credit ratings
and their dick sizes.

497
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,442
If you get me.

498
00:32:21,477 --> 00:32:23,609
Then you should also know
you're already dead.

499
00:32:23,644 --> 00:32:25,380
We don't do ransoms.

500
00:32:25,415 --> 00:32:27,943
Again, I know. I know.

501
00:32:27,978 --> 00:32:29,945
See, I know a lot, Gertrude.

502
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,881
I really do.

503
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:34,983
Like the fact that you have
300 million in U.S. dollars

504
00:32:35,018 --> 00:32:37,161
sitting in your personal vault
downstairs.

505
00:32:37,196 --> 00:32:39,229
- The fuck?
- That's right.

506
00:32:39,264 --> 00:32:42,166
300 million that
the U.S. government

507
00:32:42,201 --> 00:32:45,499
gave Lightstone to quietly
distribute in the Middle East

508
00:32:45,534 --> 00:32:47,336
to all the worst people,

509
00:32:47,371 --> 00:32:51,538
to grease the wheels
and keep that sweet oil flowing.

510
00:32:51,573 --> 00:32:56,004
300 million that... oops...
Disappeared in the fog of war.

511
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:59,007
Except it didn't really
disappear, did it, Gerty?

512
00:32:59,042 --> 00:33:00,415
'Cause you stole it.

513
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:01,911
Did you know about this?

514
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:03,517
Man, this family.

515
00:33:03,552 --> 00:33:06,718
This moneygrubbing family.

516
00:33:06,753 --> 00:33:08,555
Clinging desperately
to your wealth,

517
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:10,854
when your poor employees
don't even have enough coal

518
00:33:10,889 --> 00:33:12,922
to keep Tiny Tim warm.

519
00:33:12,957 --> 00:33:15,892
What is it with you
and all this Christmas shit?

520
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:17,894
Talk all you want.

521
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:19,698
You'll never get in the vault.

522
00:33:19,733 --> 00:33:23,031
Oh, oh, oh, because when
you-you hit the panic button,

523
00:33:23,066 --> 00:33:24,868
it reset the combination?

524
00:33:24,903 --> 00:33:28,278
I keep telling you, I know.

525
00:33:33,483 --> 00:33:36,286
This is what breaking
into a vault has turned into?

526
00:33:36,321 --> 00:33:40,917
Remember when you just had to
drill holes and blow shit up?

527
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:42,457
I don't know,
maybe I'm getting old,

528
00:33:42,492 --> 00:33:44,096
but there was something
romantic about that.

529
00:33:44,131 --> 00:33:46,197
Boss, you copy?

530
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:48,133
I'm kind of busy here.

531
00:33:48,168 --> 00:33:50,498
You're gonna want to see this.

532
00:33:59,905 --> 00:34:01,707
Maybe he fell.

533
00:34:01,742 --> 00:34:03,247
You rappel down buildings
with him.

534
00:34:03,282 --> 00:34:05,282
You gonna tell me
he just fell out a window?

535
00:34:06,351 --> 00:34:08,318
All right, look lively, gang.

536
00:34:08,353 --> 00:34:10,012
We got a gopher.

537
00:34:25,601 --> 00:34:27,172
You know what?

538
00:34:27,207 --> 00:34:31,143
Um, I think Mr. Bunny
wants to go to sleep.

539
00:34:31,178 --> 00:34:33,101
So, let's tuck him in.

540
00:34:33,136 --> 00:34:34,674
Okay?

541
00:34:35,875 --> 00:34:37,545
It's gonna be okay.

542
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:54,023
Hello? Santa?

543
00:34:54,058 --> 00:34:56,025
Are you there?

544
00:35:01,835 --> 00:35:03,505
Shit.

545
00:35:07,907 --> 00:35:10,446
This is
Candy Cane at checkpoint three.

546
00:35:10,481 --> 00:35:12,041
Oh, shit.

547
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:13,812
Shit. Shit. Shit.

548
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:18,916
Video game.

549
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,523
Video game.

550
00:35:21,558 --> 00:35:23,822
Didn't anybody ask
for a bat or a sword

551
00:35:23,857 --> 00:35:26,726
or Molotov cocktails?

552
00:35:35,374 --> 00:35:37,033
Wait.

553
00:35:51,951 --> 00:35:53,753
Mommy, I love you.

554
00:35:54,954 --> 00:35:57,020

Compound is clear and secured.

602
00:39:02,482 --> 00:39:04,273
Copy. What's the
status on the Kill Squad?

603
00:39:06,145 --> 00:39:08,046
Kill Squad
won't be here for two hours.

604
00:39:08,081 --> 00:39:10,686
So we're doing good. The outer
seal's already been breached.

605
00:39:10,721 --> 00:39:13,216
Is there a 911 thing on here?

606
00:39:13,251 --> 00:39:15,790
My...

607
00:39:15,825 --> 00:39:17,759
Am I doing that correct?

608
00:39:17,794 --> 00:39:19,189
Hello?

609
00:39:19,224 --> 00:39:21,125
Hello, can anybody hear me?

610
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,600
Can you hear me, Santa?

611
00:39:25,428 --> 00:39:26,735
Hello?

612
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:28,231
Santa?

613
00:39:31,434 --> 00:39:33,137
Yeah, this is Santa.

614
00:39:36,109 --> 00:39:38,450
I hope I'm not bothering you.

615
00:39:40,146 --> 00:39:42,751
Daddy said you were
very busy tonight.

616
00:39:44,689 --> 00:39:46,557
I'm...

617
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:48,790
I'm on a break.

618
00:39:48,825 --> 00:39:50,858
Who-who am I speaking to?

619
00:39:53,357 --> 00:39:55,423
My name is Trudy Lightstone,

620
00:39:55,458 --> 00:39:58,767
and I've been very good
this year.

621
00:39:58,802 --> 00:40:00,670
Trudy...

622
00:40:02,971 --> 00:40:04,839
Trudy Lightstone.

623
00:40:13,883 --> 00:40:16,147
Yeah, Trudy.

624
00:40:16,182 --> 00:40:18,622
You're on my nice list.

625
00:40:18,657 --> 00:40:20,822
You've been a very good girl
this year.

626
00:40:22,485 --> 00:40:24,529
Where are you now, Trudy?

627
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:28,830
I'm in a big room
with all my relatives.

628
00:40:28,865 --> 00:40:32,064
There's two bad men with guns
watching us.

629
00:40:34,838 --> 00:40:36,673
Oh, no. Six left.

630
00:40:36,708 --> 00:40:38,642
Are you gonna help us, Santa?

631
00:40:40,041 --> 00:40:42,008
Yeah. Of course
I'm gonna help you.

632
00:40:42,043 --> 00:40:44,879
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna get you out of there.

633
00:40:44,914 --> 00:40:48,179
Take all these bad guys
on my naughty list...

634
00:40:49,248 --> 00:40:51,853
I'm gonna take a lump of coal,

635
00:40:51,888 --> 00:40:55,560
each and every one of them,
and shove it straight up...

636
00:40:55,595 --> 00:40:56,693
The ass.

637
00:40:59,731 --> 00:41:01,390
Well, I mean, come on, sweetie.

638
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:04,096
We want to keep you
on the nice list, you know.

639
00:41:05,704 --> 00:41:08,034
Sorry.
Can I say "butthole," then?

640
00:41:09,037 --> 00:41:10,366
I mean, it's borderline.

641
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:12,137
How about "anus"?

642
00:41:12,172 --> 00:41:16,548
Technically, yes,
uh, "anus" is the tech...

643
00:41:16,583 --> 00:41:18,341
Okay, look, uh, Tru...
uh, Trudy.

644
00:41:18,376 --> 00:41:21,047
I got to call for help,
and the phone lines are down.

645
00:41:21,082 --> 00:41:23,654
You probably know this house
better than anybody.

646
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:25,513
You got any suggestions?

647
00:41:25,548 --> 00:41:27,086
I have an idea.

648
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:32,091
All right, you're telling me
there's a goddamn Santa Claus

649
00:41:32,126 --> 00:41:33,796
running around here?

650
00:41:37,263 --> 00:41:39,263
Okay, well,
he looks jolly as fuck,

651
00:41:39,298 --> 00:41:40,935
but who the hell is he?

652
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:42,937
There's no Santa listed
on the employee manifest.

653
00:41:42,972 --> 00:41:44,400
Yeah, there's more.

654
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:46,039
Frosty hasn't checked in.
I can't reach him.

655
00:41:46,074 --> 00:41:47,942
All right, keep trying.

656
00:41:50,617 --> 00:41:52,243
All right, it's official.

657
00:41:52,278 --> 00:41:54,113
We got a gopher on the loose,
and he's dangerous.

658
00:41:54,148 --> 00:41:55,411
Watch your backs.

659
00:42:00,418 --> 00:42:03,089
Al? Al?

660
00:42:09,328 --> 00:42:11,163
Oh, shit.

661
00:42:19,008 --> 00:42:20,810
Oh, shit!

662
00:42:20,845 --> 00:42:23,813
Frosty, what's your status?

663
00:42:27,346 --> 00:42:29,412
Frosty, sound off.

664
00:42:30,415 --> 00:42:33,284
Uh, Frosty?

665
00:42:34,617 --> 00:42:36,155
Is-is that, uh...

666
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:38,091
is that the naughty guy
I met in the basement?

667
00:42:38,126 --> 00:42:39,961
Your-your friend is dead.

668
00:42:39,996 --> 00:42:43,063
Uh, he got a star in his face,
then his head caught on fire.

669
00:42:43,098 --> 00:42:44,933
It's a long story.

670
00:42:44,968 --> 00:42:47,738
Oh.

671
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:49,938
Is this... is this our Santy?

672
00:42:49,973 --> 00:42:52,842
Is this our... our Santy Claus?

673
00:42:52,877 --> 00:42:54,338
Yeah, it is.

674
00:42:55,341 --> 00:42:57,176
To whom am I speaking?

675
00:42:57,211 --> 00:42:59,178
Well, for tonight,
I'm Mr. Scrooge.

676
00:42:59,213 --> 00:43:03,116
Now, what is it
that you want exactly, Santa?

677
00:43:03,151 --> 00:43:05,690
I want you to put down
your weapons,

678
00:43:05,725 --> 00:43:08,660
I want you to let
this family go,

679
00:43:08,695 --> 00:43:10,519
and then I want to find
my reindeer,

680
00:43:10,554 --> 00:43:12,697
and I want to continue
delivering my presents.

681
00:43:15,625 --> 00:43:17,262
Are you fucking with me?

682
00:43:17,297 --> 00:43:19,627
All right, who the hell
are you really, huh?

683
00:43:19,662 --> 00:43:22,168
Some security guard who's
watched too many action flicks?

684
00:43:22,203 --> 00:43:24,775
Some loser ex-cop
stuck in a mall

685
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,810
playing dress-up with fat kids
pissing on your lap?

686
00:43:26,845 --> 00:43:28,339
Stop me when I get it right.

687
00:43:28,374 --> 00:43:30,440
It's a little more complicated
than that.

688
00:43:30,475 --> 00:43:32,211
Not to me, it's not.

689
00:43:32,246 --> 00:43:34,213
'Cause I want to make it
my personal mission,

690
00:43:34,248 --> 00:43:38,646
my holiday to-do list,
to find you and to end you

691
00:43:38,681 --> 00:43:42,221
and to wipe my ass with you
and this whole fucking holiday.

692
00:43:42,256 --> 00:43:44,894
That's what I want
for Christmas, Santa.

693
00:43:44,929 --> 00:43:49,063
That is a terrible thing
to want for Christmas.

694
00:43:49,098 --> 00:43:52,561
But maybe you and I should
discuss that in person.

695
00:43:53,938 --> 00:43:56,499
Santa Claus is coming to town.

696
00:44:08,018 --> 00:44:09,347
Shit.

697
00:44:19,392 --> 00:44:20,765
All right, who did you hire

698
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,328
to play Santa at
your Christmas party, huh?

699
00:44:23,363 --> 00:44:25,396
I said, who's playing Santa

700
00:44:25,431 --> 00:44:26,936
at your fucked-up
Christmas party?

701
00:44:26,971 --> 00:44:29,873
I didn't hire a Santa.

702
00:44:29,908 --> 00:44:32,568
I never have a Santa.
It's tacky.

703
00:44:32,603 --> 00:44:34,042
So, who is he?

704
00:44:34,077 --> 00:44:36,847
♪ Oh, what fun
it is to ride... ♪

705
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:39,674
Huh? Who is he?

706
00:44:39,709 --> 00:44:41,379
Somebody better start talking,

707
00:44:41,414 --> 00:44:44,448
or I'm gonna bash
her brains in with this...

708
00:44:44,483 --> 00:44:48,727
Damn, Gertrude. You really got
a thing for nutcrackers, huh?

709
00:44:50,225 --> 00:44:54,260
So, I'm gonna torture
everyone in your family

710
00:44:54,295 --> 00:44:57,098
until you tell me who's
running around your mansion

711
00:44:57,133 --> 00:44:59,804
playing Santa
and fucking with my shit.

712
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:01,806
And who should I pick first?

713
00:45:01,841 --> 00:45:03,302
Should I go by age?

714
00:45:03,337 --> 00:45:04,908
Shh.

715
00:45:04,943 --> 00:45:06,734
Or should I go by IQ?

716
00:45:06,769 --> 00:45:10,078
Pick Jason.
He's my mom's favorite.

717
00:45:10,113 --> 00:45:12,113
- Yep. Him.
- The one in the sweater.

718
00:45:12,148 --> 00:45:14,577
All right.
Jason Lightstone it is.

719
00:45:14,612 --> 00:45:15,919
- The number one son.
- No.

720
00:45:15,954 --> 00:45:17,283
Wait, wait, wait.
No, we don't need...

721
00:45:17,318 --> 00:45:18,823
We don't need to do that.
No, it's okay.

722
00:45:18,858 --> 00:45:20,792
No. No, no, no.
We don't need to do this.

723
00:45:20,827 --> 00:45:22,057
No. No, no, no, no.

724
00:45:22,092 --> 00:45:23,652
Don't, don't, don't.

725
00:45:23,687 --> 00:45:26,061
- No, don't... Put it...
- Don't... No. -

726
00:45:26,096 --> 00:45:28,063
- No, no, no, no. No, no.
- Give me this fucking...

727
00:45:37,107 --> 00:45:39,943
I'm telling you,
no one hired a Santa.

728
00:45:39,978 --> 00:45:41,472
All right, all right,
all right. You're right.

729
00:45:41,507 --> 00:45:42,506
You're right.
Let's stop it. Let's stop it.

730
00:45:42,541 --> 00:45:44,673
What are we doing here? Come on.

731
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:47,775
What are we, amateurs?
We're half-assing this.

732
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:50,712
Come on. It's not called
a finger cracker.

733
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:53,924
Okay, Candy Cane.

734
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:55,354
Stick one of his bozaks
in there.

735
00:45:55,389 --> 00:45:56,652
I'm not touching his balls.

736
00:45:56,687 --> 00:45:58,291
What, are you a princess
all of a sudden?

737
00:45:58,326 --> 00:46:00,095
I've seen you
scoop out brains before.

738
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:01,360
You want me
to scoop his brains out,

739
00:46:01,395 --> 00:46:02,790
I'll scoop his brains out
right now,

740
00:46:02,825 --> 00:46:04,033
but I'm not touching his junk.

741
00:46:04,068 --> 00:46:05,463
I don't care who does it.

742
00:46:05,498 --> 00:46:07,036
I better be looking
at flat balls,

743
00:46:07,071 --> 00:46:08,334
like, in three seconds.

744
00:46:08,369 --> 00:46:10,798
I'll do it.

745
00:46:10,833 --> 00:46:12,173
Krampus. Perfect.

746
00:46:12,208 --> 00:46:13,669
Oh, not that guy. Not that guy.

747
00:46:13,704 --> 00:46:15,044
That's what I love
about sociopaths.

748
00:46:15,079 --> 00:46:16,375
Always up for trying new things.

749
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:17,805
You don't need to do this, okay?

750
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,708
No, it's all right.
Um... Oh, no.

751
00:46:19,743 --> 00:46:22,150
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

752
00:46:22,185 --> 00:46:24,548
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

753
00:46:26,321 --> 00:46:27,782
Put your nuts in.

754
00:46:27,817 --> 00:46:29,289
Yummy, yummy.

755
00:46:29,324 --> 00:46:31,962
Stop hurting my daddy...

756
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:34,261
or Santa will get mad.

757
00:46:35,264 --> 00:46:37,528
Ah, what a cutie.

758
00:46:37,563 --> 00:46:39,629
So, what do we know
about Santa, little one?

759
00:46:39,664 --> 00:46:41,301
She doesn't know anything
about Santa.

760
00:46:42,403 --> 00:46:44,040
He wasn't asking you.

761
00:46:44,075 --> 00:46:46,570
She's playing make-believe.

762
00:46:46,605 --> 00:46:48,913
She's pretending
to talk to Santa.

763
00:46:48,948 --> 00:46:50,915
It's not pretend.
Santa's my friend,

764
00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:52,543
and he said
he's going to save us.

765
00:46:52,578 --> 00:46:53,885
No.

766
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,217
- And beat you up.
- Oh, is he?

767
00:46:56,252 --> 00:46:58,648
I bet he'd come out of hiding
if you asked him to, huh?

768
00:46:58,683 --> 00:47:00,386
What do you say you come with me

769
00:47:00,421 --> 00:47:02,421
-and we play a little game
with him, huh? -No, no, no.

770
00:47:02,456 --> 00:47:03,928
Trudy, come on.
Tell him the truth now.

771
00:47:03,963 --> 00:47:05,655
- You aren't talking to Santa.
- Yes, I am.

772
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:07,162
No, you're not. Come on, now.

773
00:47:07,197 --> 00:47:09,659
-Yes, I am. -Damn it, Trudy,
Santa isn't real!

774
00:47:17,977 --> 00:47:19,702
I'm sorry, honey.

775
00:47:20,903 --> 00:47:22,870
Santa's just a thing
adults tell kids

776
00:47:22,905 --> 00:47:24,949
to make them feel better, okay?

777
00:47:27,217 --> 00:47:29,283
Your mommy and I
give you the presents,

778
00:47:29,318 --> 00:47:31,285
and we say they're from Santa.

779
00:47:32,552 --> 00:47:34,024
He's not coming to save us.

780
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:36,257
He doesn't exist.

781
00:47:36,292 --> 00:47:38,589
It's all made-up.

782
00:47:40,263 --> 00:47:42,230
- Really?
- Aw.

783
00:47:42,265 --> 00:47:45,035
What a way to find out
that there's no Santa.

784
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:47,070
Hey, let's come back Easter
and ruin the Easter Bunny

785
00:47:47,105 --> 00:47:49,039
for her, too, huh?

786
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:50,568
- Trudy!
- Come back here!

787
00:47:50,603 --> 00:47:52,108
- Stop her!
- Trudy! -Hey!

788
00:47:52,143 --> 00:47:53,472
You idiots, stay at your posts.

789
00:47:53,507 --> 00:47:54,803
Trudy!

790
00:47:54,838 --> 00:47:57,014
I'll find this little brat.

791
00:49:03,379 --> 00:49:04,675
Okay.

792
00:49:33,409 --> 00:49:36,377
Santa. Santa.

793
00:49:36,412 --> 00:49:38,247
Santa!

794
00:49:39,844 --> 00:49:41,679
This is Trudy.

795
00:49:42,682 --> 00:49:45,683
Are you okay, Santa?

796
00:49:47,753 --> 00:49:49,225
Hi. Hey.

797
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:51,018
Are you okay?

798
00:49:51,053 --> 00:49:53,097
I'm good. Uh...

799
00:49:53,132 --> 00:49:55,330
I was just wrapping
something up.

800
00:49:55,365 --> 00:49:57,563
I ran away and hid in the attic.

801
00:49:57,598 --> 00:50:00,896
Okay. If you're safe...

802
00:50:00,931 --> 00:50:03,899
uh, just stay there
and, uh, stay quiet, all right?

803
00:50:03,934 --> 00:50:08,706
Okay. I can set up booby traps,
like in<i> Home Alone.</i>

804
00:50:08,741 --> 00:50:10,246
Okay, I don't know
what that means,

805
00:50:10,281 --> 00:50:11,907
but, uh, yeah, do that.

806
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:13,810
Just do it quietly.

807
00:50:15,286 --> 00:50:17,253
Are you really Santa?

808
00:50:21,083 --> 00:50:23,094
Of course I am, sweetheart.

809
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:26,790
My daddy says
there isn't any Santa.

810
00:50:28,596 --> 00:50:31,564
He says parents just tell
their kids that Santa's real

811
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:33,203
to make them feel better.

812
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:36,030
He said they give us presents

813
00:50:36,065 --> 00:50:38,406
and say they're from Santa.

814
00:50:38,441 --> 00:50:40,573
Yeah.

815
00:50:40,608 --> 00:50:42,872
Yeah, a lot of parents say that.

816
00:50:42,907 --> 00:50:46,678
But I still bring presents
to kids that need me.

817
00:50:48,077 --> 00:50:50,187
Kids who really believe.

818
00:50:51,751 --> 00:50:54,620
How do you know
who really needs you?

819
00:50:54,655 --> 00:50:56,886
Christmas magic.

820
00:50:56,921 --> 00:50:58,987
I'm not really sure
how it works.

821
00:51:06,799 --> 00:51:09,140
But, uh...

822
00:51:11,375 --> 00:51:14,475
I remember, um...

823
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:16,411
when Trudy Lightstone
wrote to me.

824
00:51:16,446 --> 00:51:18,908
She must have been
about six years old,

825
00:51:18,943 --> 00:51:22,681
and she said that
she felt lonely sometimes.

826
00:51:22,716 --> 00:51:24,980
She missed having a best friend.

827
00:51:25,015 --> 00:51:26,421
And so I brought her

828
00:51:26,456 --> 00:51:28,258
a beautiful little
stuffed rabbit.

829
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:29,688
Mr. Bunny.

830
00:51:29,723 --> 00:51:31,657
And then I remember
the next year,

831
00:51:31,692 --> 00:51:33,824
and you said you had
this amazing dream

832
00:51:33,859 --> 00:51:37,630
and that, afterwards,
all you wanted to do was...

833
00:51:37,665 --> 00:51:39,170
To fly!

834
00:51:39,205 --> 00:51:41,238
To fly. To fly.

835
00:51:42,802 --> 00:51:47,101
I mean, Santa might have
some magic, but...

836
00:51:47,136 --> 00:51:50,742
making a little girl fly?

837
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:57,320
But giving you a kite,

838
00:51:57,355 --> 00:52:00,653
floating just beneath
the clouds,

839
00:52:00,688 --> 00:52:03,458
well, it's about
as good as it gets.

840
00:52:03,493 --> 00:52:05,295
I knew it.

841
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:07,528
I knew you were real, Santa.

842
00:52:10,434 --> 00:52:13,204
Don't be too hard
on your parents, all right?

843
00:52:15,373 --> 00:52:17,901
Grown-ups have a hard time
believing things.

844
00:52:18,937 --> 00:52:21,311
Can you use your Christmas magic

845
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:23,478
to make them
love each other again?

846
00:52:23,513 --> 00:52:25,909
I wish I had that kind of power.

847
00:52:26,912 --> 00:52:30,551
Mrs. Claus and I have been
going on year, uh,

848
00:52:30,586 --> 00:52:32,718
1,100, and...

849
00:52:33,787 --> 00:52:36,359
Grown-up relationships
are complicated.

850
00:52:37,395 --> 00:52:39,659
It takes work.

851
00:52:39,694 --> 00:52:41,562
A lot of work.

852
00:52:43,962 --> 00:52:46,193
Do you still love her?

853
00:52:46,228 --> 00:52:48,030
Yeah, I do.

854
00:52:49,231 --> 00:52:52,408
And sometimes, even if you want
to make somebody happy...

855
00:52:53,939 --> 00:52:56,071
the magic just goes away.

856
00:52:58,108 --> 00:53:00,515
Hey.

857
00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:02,209
I've got an idea.

858
00:53:02,244 --> 00:53:03,782
This will be fun.

859
00:53:05,115 --> 00:53:08,391
Why don't you guys
open your presents?

860
00:53:08,426 --> 00:53:12,758
I want to see what you
rich assholes get each other.

861
00:53:12,793 --> 00:53:18,467
And some of you might not
make it till tomorrow morning,

862
00:53:18,502 --> 00:53:21,272
so this could be
your only chance.

863
00:53:22,264 --> 00:53:23,802
Come on.

864
00:53:23,837 --> 00:53:26,310
Where's the Christmas spirit?

865
00:53:27,973 --> 00:53:30,105
Uh...

866
00:53:31,174 --> 00:53:35,418
Gertrude, uh, I got you
something pretty special.

867
00:53:35,453 --> 00:53:36,815
Did you hear that, Gertrude?

868
00:53:36,850 --> 00:53:38,784
He got you something amazing.

869
00:53:38,819 --> 00:53:41,721
Oh, what could it be?

870
00:53:41,756 --> 00:53:43,954
Oh, my God, this is exciting.

871
00:53:43,989 --> 00:53:46,220
Mom.

872
00:53:46,255 --> 00:53:47,925
Can I call you Mom?

873
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:50,664
Mrs. Lightstone.

874
00:53:52,701 --> 00:53:55,966
Okay, so in the business,
they call this...

875
00:53:56,969 --> 00:53:58,276
a pitch deck.

876
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:00,509
- Pitch deck.
- Yeah.

877
00:54:00,544 --> 00:54:02,236
It's called<i> Explosive Force.</i>

878
00:54:02,271 --> 00:54:03,941
Starring me.

879
00:54:03,976 --> 00:54:05,514
And if you look in the back,

880
00:54:05,549 --> 00:54:09,177
there are the financial numbers.

881
00:54:09,212 --> 00:54:12,389
I'm kind of a big deal in Asia.

882
00:54:13,953 --> 00:54:16,151
Parts of Asia, at least.

883
00:54:16,186 --> 00:54:18,252
We were in parts of Asia once,
and, like,

884
00:54:18,287 --> 00:54:19,924
we couldn't even go
to a restaurant.

885
00:54:19,959 --> 00:54:23,290
Ah, what is there
a better gift than...

886
00:54:23,325 --> 00:54:26,535
gift of a golden opportunity?

887
00:54:28,198 --> 00:54:30,198
Oh, no.

888
00:54:31,542 --> 00:54:34,103
Granny doesn't like it.

889
00:54:34,138 --> 00:54:36,413
Mother, I got you something
really special.

890
00:54:42,982 --> 00:54:45,521
It's a sentimental photo
of the day I was born.

891
00:54:45,556 --> 00:54:47,622
I remember.

892
00:54:47,657 --> 00:54:49,052
I was there.

893
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:51,120
She doesn't give a shit.

894
00:54:53,729 --> 00:54:55,322
Swing and miss again!

895
00:54:55,357 --> 00:54:56,697
This is so fun.

896
00:54:56,732 --> 00:54:57,995
Mommy, how about another one?

897
00:54:58,030 --> 00:54:59,634
I got you a lot of good things.

898
00:54:59,669 --> 00:55:01,669
- I'll grab one.
- Alva, Alva, sit down.

899
00:55:01,704 --> 00:55:03,374
You've already given me one.
It's...

900
00:55:03,409 --> 00:55:04,672
It's Jason's turn.

901
00:55:04,707 --> 00:55:06,135
Uh...

902
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:09,743
I th... I-I think
I left it in the car.

903
00:55:09,778 --> 00:55:11,844
No, I-I saw you put one
under the tree earlier.

904
00:55:11,879 --> 00:55:14,308
- No. It's in the...
- Yeah, I did.

905
00:55:14,343 --> 00:55:17,421
I could've sworn.
You know what, it's, uh...

906
00:55:17,456 --> 00:55:19,522
Y-You don't... you don't...
you don't... you...

907
00:55:19,557 --> 00:55:21,821
It's this one, right?
Yeah, I got you, bro.

908
00:55:21,856 --> 00:55:23,350
Come on.

909
00:55:25,090 --> 00:55:27,123
Thank you.

910
00:55:28,192 --> 00:55:30,434
It's my favorite whiskey.

911
00:55:30,469 --> 00:55:33,063
You can skip the note.

912
00:55:56,495 --> 00:55:58,154
Thank you, Jason.

913
00:56:03,667 --> 00:56:05,964
What's the card say?

914
00:56:05,999 --> 00:56:08,934
I think I'll just keep that
between Jason and I.

915
00:56:08,969 --> 00:56:12,905
No one really needs to know.
Right, Jason?

916
00:56:15,481 --> 00:56:17,107
Right.

917
00:56:18,308 --> 00:56:20,484
<i>Did you ever have
a mommy and daddy?</i>

918
00:56:22,521 --> 00:56:24,554
Yeah, of course
I had a mommy and daddy.

919
00:56:24,589 --> 00:56:27,920
I wasn't...
I wasn't always Santa Claus.

920
00:56:28,956 --> 00:56:31,022
I had a life before this.

921
00:56:32,190 --> 00:56:34,663
A long, long, long time ago.

922
00:56:39,098 --> 00:56:41,967
They used to call me, uh...

923
00:56:42,002 --> 00:56:44,134
Nicomund.

924
00:56:47,843 --> 00:56:49,337
<i>Nicomund the Red.</i>

925
00:56:51,143 --> 00:56:53,781
<i>You had a different job then?</i>

926
00:56:53,816 --> 00:56:56,487
<i>Yeah, you could say that.</i>

927
00:56:56,522 --> 00:56:58,313
<i>I was a warrior.</i>

928
00:56:58,348 --> 00:57:00,656
<i>A raider. A thief.</i>

929
00:57:00,691 --> 00:57:04,418
<i>And if somebody got in my way,</i>

930
00:57:04,453 --> 00:57:05,991
<i>me and Skullcrusher would...</i>

931
00:57:06,026 --> 00:57:07,498
<i>Who's Skullcrusher?</i>

932
00:57:08,490 --> 00:57:11,634
Skullcrusher's my, uh...

933
00:57:11,669 --> 00:57:14,296
my hammer.

934
00:57:14,331 --> 00:57:16,606
My favorite hammer.

935
00:57:16,641 --> 00:57:19,037
I was a surgeon with that thing.

936
00:57:19,072 --> 00:57:21,369
Used to be able to take
three heads, line 'em up...

937
00:57:22,911 --> 00:57:25,615
But why?

938
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:27,177
What?

939
00:57:27,212 --> 00:57:29,520
Why'd you do those things?

940
00:57:31,689 --> 00:57:33,557
Because I was mean.

941
00:57:35,022 --> 00:57:36,923
And I was greedy.

942
00:57:38,927 --> 00:57:41,895
And I wanted gold, jewels.

943
00:57:41,930 --> 00:57:44,326
Yeah, I mean, if there was
a naughty list back then,

944
00:57:44,361 --> 00:57:46,361
I'd be top dog.

945
00:57:48,068 --> 00:57:50,002
Well, maybe...

946
00:57:51,005 --> 00:57:52,400
What?

947
00:57:52,435 --> 00:57:54,402
Maybe all those bad things
you used to do...

948
00:57:55,746 --> 00:57:58,615
maybe you can use them
to do good things instead.

949
00:57:59,618 --> 00:58:01,981
To help.

950
00:58:02,016 --> 00:58:03,851
What do you mean?

951
00:58:03,886 --> 00:58:08,317
Mr. Bunny, he wasn't just a toy.

952
00:58:08,352 --> 00:58:11,595
That night, you gave me
what I wished for.

953
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:13,454
A best friend.

954
00:58:14,523 --> 00:58:17,260
'Cause you're good and kind.

955
00:58:17,295 --> 00:58:20,736
And you mean more than just
the presents you bring.

956
00:58:20,771 --> 00:58:23,365
That's why I believe in you,
Santa.

957
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,642
That's why I believe.

958
00:58:31,375 --> 00:58:32,979
Thank you.

959
00:58:34,983 --> 00:58:38,919
You stay hidden, Trudy,
till I come get you.

960
00:58:38,954 --> 00:58:40,888
Stay safe.

961
00:58:42,089 --> 00:58:44,694
All right,
we got satellite confirmation.

962
00:58:44,729 --> 00:58:46,861
Extraction team's on the go.

963
00:58:46,896 --> 00:58:49,193
30 minutes.

964
00:58:49,228 --> 00:58:50,766
We're on schedule.

965
00:58:50,801 --> 00:58:52,295
Everything's good.

966
00:58:52,330 --> 00:58:53,802
All right, fellas.

967
00:58:53,837 --> 00:58:55,298
Look alive, look alive.

968
00:58:55,333 --> 00:58:57,234
You all know the plan,

969
00:58:57,269 --> 00:59:00,710
and I like my operations
like I like to fuck:

970
00:59:00,745 --> 00:59:03,405
hard and fast
with minimal cleanup.

971
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:07,882
Now, some idiot gets
in your way, what do you do?

972
00:59:07,917 --> 00:59:09,950
Fuck their shit up right!

973
00:59:09,985 --> 00:59:11,589
Damn right.

974
00:59:12,581 --> 00:59:14,955
Time to lube up.

975
00:59:16,354 --> 00:59:18,761
Let's go, motherfuckers!
Let's go!

976
00:59:24,934 --> 00:59:26,967
This fucking family.

977
00:59:46,549 --> 00:59:48,582
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

978
00:59:48,617 --> 00:59:50,320
Merry Christmas.

979
00:59:50,355 --> 00:59:51,662
Happy holidays.

980
00:59:51,697 --> 00:59:52,795
Traitor.

981
00:59:54,392 --> 00:59:56,359
I got him in the east wing.

982
00:59:56,394 --> 00:59:58,702
All right,
we're on our way. Hold him.

983
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:13,882
Step aside.

984
01:00:27,766 --> 01:00:30,459
Now, how did this tired, old,

985
01:00:30,494 --> 01:00:33,033
fat piece of shit
get the drop on us?

986
01:00:33,068 --> 01:00:34,628
I don't know.

987
01:00:34,663 --> 01:00:36,630
He's not even armed.

988
01:00:36,665 --> 01:00:38,907
This bag is the only thing
he had on him.

989
01:00:38,942 --> 01:00:40,205
What's in there?

990
01:00:41,175 --> 01:00:42,944
Can't see anything.

991
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:48,609
Here, give it to me.

992
01:00:59,765 --> 01:01:02,359
What kind of moron...

993
01:01:02,394 --> 01:01:04,427
carries a chess set with him?

994
01:01:08,235 --> 01:01:09,872
What the fuck?

995
01:01:09,907 --> 01:01:12,270
Doesn't make any sense.
Look at all this shit.

996
01:01:19,576 --> 01:01:22,346
So, you're gonna tell us what's
the gimmick with the bag?

997
01:01:22,381 --> 01:01:24,117
It's magic.

998
01:01:24,152 --> 01:01:26,823
You put your hand in,
out comes a present.

999
01:01:28,794 --> 01:01:31,256
I don't really understand
how it works, either.

1000
01:01:32,721 --> 01:01:35,766
So, you're Mr. Scrooge.

1001
01:01:35,801 --> 01:01:37,724
That's right.

1002
01:01:37,759 --> 01:01:39,462
But who are you?

1003
01:01:39,497 --> 01:01:41,563
Weihnachtsmann.

1004
01:01:43,072 --> 01:01:44,742
Julenissen.

1005
01:01:45,844 --> 01:01:47,745
Shèngdàn Laorén.

1006
01:01:48,770 --> 01:01:51,782
Babbo Natale, Père Noel,
Kris Kringle.

1007
01:01:51,817 --> 01:01:54,411
Jolly old Saint Nick.

1008
01:01:54,446 --> 01:01:57,249
People call me a lot of things.

1009
01:01:58,285 --> 01:02:00,791
Ha, ha, ha. Very funny.

1010
01:02:00,826 --> 01:02:03,255
Or should I say, "Ho, ho, ho"?

1011
01:02:03,290 --> 01:02:06,720
If you're Santa,
where's your reindeer?

1012
01:02:06,755 --> 01:02:08,755
They were on the roof

1013
01:02:08,790 --> 01:02:11,296
until that guy I turned
into an ice kebab just...

1014
01:02:13,872 --> 01:02:15,333
You don't believe me?

1015
01:02:15,368 --> 01:02:16,763
Go check.

1016
01:02:16,798 --> 01:02:19,469
Prancer left
a tasty log up there.

1017
01:02:19,504 --> 01:02:21,273
This fucking guy.

1018
01:02:21,308 --> 01:02:23,143
You don't think...

1019
01:02:23,178 --> 01:02:26,113
Now, I know you're an idiot,
but don't be an idiot out loud.

1020
01:02:26,148 --> 01:02:28,181
Come on,
he's just in Santy Claus

1021
01:02:28,216 --> 01:02:30,183
with a fucking trick bag.

1022
01:02:30,218 --> 01:02:32,251
Oh, no!

1023
01:02:32,286 --> 01:02:33,989
That bag was full
of kids' dreams!

1024
01:02:34,024 --> 01:02:35,991
Oh, come on.

1025
01:02:36,026 --> 01:02:38,158
Everybody knows that
Christmas dreams are bullshit.

1026
01:02:39,161 --> 01:02:41,359
My father used to make
a big deal out of it

1027
01:02:41,394 --> 01:02:43,361
every Christmas.

1028
01:02:43,396 --> 01:02:45,594
Every freaking Christmas
with the presents

1029
01:02:45,629 --> 01:02:47,871
and the candy
and the decorations

1030
01:02:47,906 --> 01:02:51,369
and the Christmas caroling
and all that bullshit.

1031
01:02:52,878 --> 01:02:55,175
And then when I was...

1032
01:02:55,210 --> 01:02:58,706
I don't know, ten, 11,

1033
01:02:58,741 --> 01:03:00,642
he got laid off,
and that Christmas,

1034
01:03:00,677 --> 01:03:02,017
couldn't even afford a tree.

1035
01:03:02,052 --> 01:03:03,711
No Christmas dinner, no gifts.

1036
01:03:03,746 --> 01:03:06,021
Nothing, nada,<i> culo,</i> dick.

1037
01:03:07,024 --> 01:03:08,485
But our neighbors...

1038
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:10,322
our neighbors,
oh, they had it all.

1039
01:03:10,357 --> 01:03:12,060
I could see
all that yuletide cheer

1040
01:03:12,095 --> 01:03:14,722
through their window mocking me.

1041
01:03:14,757 --> 01:03:18,627
So Christmas Eve
rolls around, and...

1042
01:03:18,662 --> 01:03:21,696
I waited for everybody
to go to bed.

1043
01:03:21,731 --> 01:03:24,908
And then I snuck in there
to take it all.

1044
01:03:26,175 --> 01:03:28,538
Only problem was that
the gramps got up to take a piss

1045
01:03:28,573 --> 01:03:30,804
and the two of us scared
the shit out of each other.

1046
01:03:30,839 --> 01:03:34,148
And, um, he fell down the stairs

1047
01:03:34,183 --> 01:03:38,548
and-and broke his neck,
and he died in the hospital.

1048
01:03:38,583 --> 01:03:40,088
Everybody thought that I did it,

1049
01:03:40,123 --> 01:03:41,716
and every time
I tried to tell them,

1050
01:03:41,751 --> 01:03:43,861
I tried to tell them that...

1051
01:03:45,689 --> 01:03:47,898
Anyway, maybe I did do it.

1052
01:03:47,933 --> 01:03:49,933
Maybe I did push him.

1053
01:03:49,968 --> 01:03:51,935
Poor old fucker.

1054
01:03:51,970 --> 01:03:55,268
So, you see,
Christmas ruined my life.

1055
01:03:55,303 --> 01:03:56,863
Okay? But you know what?

1056
01:03:56,898 --> 01:03:58,337
It set me on the path

1057
01:03:58,372 --> 01:04:00,372
and made me the great man
that I am today.

1058
01:04:00,407 --> 01:04:02,209
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

1059
01:04:03,212 --> 01:04:04,607
I really am.

1060
01:04:05,643 --> 01:04:07,676
But I do gifts.
I do Christmas cheer.

1061
01:04:07,711 --> 01:04:09,920
I don't get involved
in people's lives.

1062
01:04:09,955 --> 01:04:13,583
Oh, yeah? Yeah, well,
maybe you fucking should!

1063
01:04:18,227 --> 01:04:21,393
Um, how did he know your name?

1064
01:04:21,428 --> 01:04:23,032
Oh, Bjorn.

1065
01:04:23,067 --> 01:04:25,199
What's your excuse?

1066
01:04:25,234 --> 01:04:26,893
Huh?

1067
01:04:26,928 --> 01:04:30,072
Didn't I get you that Huffy bike
you wanted back in '82?

1068
01:04:30,107 --> 01:04:33,372
One you wrote me 50 times about!

1069
01:04:33,407 --> 01:04:34,978
What about you, Kira?

1070
01:04:35,013 --> 01:04:37,948
Well, you made your brother
eat worms.

1071
01:04:37,983 --> 01:04:39,576
That's naughty!

1072
01:04:39,611 --> 01:04:41,446
Okay, how does he know
about my bike?

1073
01:04:41,481 --> 01:04:44,988
It's a lucky guess, like:
"Hey, do you like big tits?"

1074
01:04:45,023 --> 01:04:47,254
Come on, every kid wants
a fucking bike.

1075
01:04:47,289 --> 01:04:50,389
-You're gonna tell me who you
work for... -Oh, Christ. No.

1076
01:04:50,424 --> 01:04:53,491
Then you've got five seconds
to tell me who you really are.

1077
01:04:53,526 --> 01:04:56,296
Five, four, three, two...

1078
01:04:56,331 --> 01:04:57,968
I'm Santa Claus!

1079
01:04:58,003 --> 01:05:00,102
Well, not anymore.

1080
01:05:25,195 --> 01:05:27,195
Is it snowing?

1081
01:05:27,230 --> 01:05:30,297
Is he doing this
with Santa magic?

1082
01:05:36,899 --> 01:05:39,141
Let it snow!

1083
01:05:51,012 --> 01:05:52,979
It's not snow.

1084
01:05:53,014 --> 01:05:54,387
It's Styrofoam.

1085
01:05:54,422 --> 01:05:56,488
I told you this guy's
a big phony.

1086
01:06:11,032 --> 01:06:13,142
Where'd he go?

1087
01:06:13,177 --> 01:06:14,638
He went up the chimney.

1088
01:06:14,673 --> 01:06:16,244
- I saw it.
- I don't know,

1089
01:06:16,279 --> 01:06:18,246
he had a rig
or some pulley system

1090
01:06:18,281 --> 01:06:20,314
- that just yanked him up.
- You can't fit up there.

1091
01:06:20,349 --> 01:06:21,909
- It's impossible.
- Oh, you see one weird thing,

1092
01:06:21,944 --> 01:06:24,087
and then you think
you're in a fairy tale?

1093
01:06:24,122 --> 01:06:25,418
Incoming.

1094
01:06:25,453 --> 01:06:26,320
We've got sleigh bells
approaching.

1095
01:06:26,355 --> 01:06:28,058
Oh, my God.

1096
01:06:28,093 --> 01:06:29,917
It's his reindeer.

1097
01:06:31,723 --> 01:06:33,690
It's the extraction team.

1098
01:06:33,725 --> 01:06:35,692
Pull yourselves together!

1099
01:06:50,874 --> 01:06:54,942
And that is the sound
of my Kill Squad.

1100
01:06:56,583 --> 01:06:58,616
Oh, you're fizzity-fucked now.

1101
01:06:58,651 --> 01:07:00,684
Huh? What are you gonna do?
You little elf bitch.

1102
01:07:00,719 --> 01:07:02,224
Fu...

1103
01:07:02,259 --> 01:07:03,423
Bertie.

1104
01:07:03,458 --> 01:07:04,853
Hashtag "blessed."

1105
01:07:07,957 --> 01:07:10,463
Yeah!

1106
01:07:10,498 --> 01:07:11,695
Parkour.

1107
01:07:11,730 --> 01:07:12,894
Kill him, babe!

1108
01:07:12,929 --> 01:07:15,270
Oh!

1109
01:07:16,405 --> 01:07:17,932
Morgan's gonna save us.

1110
01:07:19,837 --> 01:07:23,311
Jean-Claude Van Dipshit
just ditched us, sweetie.

1111
01:07:30,584 --> 01:07:32,485
Hold your fire.

1112
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:34,047
Barrel roll!

1113
01:07:35,754 --> 01:07:37,050
Easy, easy.

1114
01:07:37,085 --> 01:07:38,953
- Yeah!
- Easy.

1115
01:07:38,988 --> 01:07:40,295
Identify yourself.

1116
01:07:40,330 --> 01:07:42,792
I'm one of the hostages.

1117
01:07:42,827 --> 01:07:45,960
Morgan Steel, the actor.

1118
01:07:45,995 --> 01:07:48,930
Played a lot of soldiers
in my career.

1119
01:07:48,965 --> 01:07:52,208
Can I just say, thank you
for your service. Semper fi.

1120
01:07:53,277 --> 01:07:55,145
What's the situation inside?

1121
01:07:55,180 --> 01:07:57,642
Bunch of ex-military guys,

1122
01:07:57,677 --> 01:07:59,644
but I got to warn you,
they know you're coming.

1123
01:07:59,679 --> 01:08:01,250
I think they're ready for you.

1124
01:08:01,285 --> 01:08:03,010
They better be.

1125
01:08:03,045 --> 01:08:05,111
We're on a tight schedule.

1126
01:08:05,146 --> 01:08:06,981
Shit.

1127
01:08:10,393 --> 01:08:12,492
Oh, f...

1128
01:08:12,527 --> 01:08:15,660
- All right, let's move out.
- Let's move out.

1129
01:08:19,864 --> 01:08:21,633
Come on.

1130
01:08:21,668 --> 01:08:23,866
You got to be kidding me.

1131
01:08:23,901 --> 01:08:25,505
Hey, Thorp,
you're ten minutes late.

1132
01:08:25,540 --> 01:08:27,001
What kept you?

1133
01:08:27,036 --> 01:08:29,377
Looks to me like your net's
got a hole in it.

1134
01:08:29,412 --> 01:08:31,709
Or are you just letting your
hostages out for some exercise?

1135
01:08:31,744 --> 01:08:34,041
No, no, no. We got
a wild gopher running around

1136
01:08:34,076 --> 01:08:36,516
complicating shit
and causing problems.

1137
01:08:36,551 --> 01:08:38,287
Who? Lightstone security?

1138
01:08:38,322 --> 01:08:39,717
Nah, I don't think so.
Some intruder dressed as Santa.

1139
01:08:39,752 --> 01:08:41,290
But I'm telling you,
I'm telling you,

1140
01:08:41,325 --> 01:08:43,292
there's something weird
about him.

1141
01:08:43,327 --> 01:08:45,052
Might be the real Santa.

1142
01:08:45,087 --> 01:08:47,362
- The fuck did she just say?
- Nothing, nothing.

1143
01:08:47,397 --> 01:08:48,495
She's joking.

1144
01:08:48,530 --> 01:08:50,893
My squad will take care of it.

1145
01:08:53,370 --> 01:08:55,964
Beta Team, go find this asshole.

1146
01:08:55,999 --> 01:08:58,241
Go.

1147
01:08:58,276 --> 01:09:02,377
Now, let's unwrap our present,
shall we?

1148
01:09:02,412 --> 01:09:04,709
All right, you heard the man.

1149
01:09:04,744 --> 01:09:07,250
Time to kill Santa.

1150
01:09:07,285 --> 01:09:09,813
I've got him. He's on the roof.

1151
01:09:09,848 --> 01:09:11,947
Roger that. I got eyes on him.

1152
01:09:29,472 --> 01:09:31,439
Right, Sugarplum.
Hit that button.

1153
01:09:38,415 --> 01:09:40,250
Here we go.

1154
01:09:40,285 --> 01:09:41,713
Our skeleton key.

1155
01:09:41,748 --> 01:09:43,550
The "open" magic stick.

1156
01:09:43,585 --> 01:09:45,420
This better fucking work.

1157
01:09:45,455 --> 01:09:48,016
I'm flushing my career for this,
my reputation.

1158
01:09:48,051 --> 01:09:50,557
Yeah, well, then you can
buy yourself a new rep.

1159
01:09:59,667 --> 01:10:01,304
As a kid, I loved

1160
01:10:01,339 --> 01:10:03,372
unwrapping Christmas presents
so much

1161
01:10:03,407 --> 01:10:06,067
that my mom would wrap
empty boxes for me.

1162
01:10:07,235 --> 01:10:09,279
I didn't care
that nothing was inside.

1163
01:10:21,458 --> 01:10:23,920
Is this a fucking joke?

1164
01:10:23,955 --> 01:10:25,185
No.

1165
01:10:26,661 --> 01:10:28,562
You said it would
fucking be here!

1166
01:10:28,597 --> 01:10:32,060
I'm telling you,
my intel was rock solid.

1167
01:10:32,095 --> 01:10:34,469
I had guys on the inside.

1168
01:10:35,769 --> 01:10:39,133
300 million in cash
was delivered here yesterday

1169
01:10:39,168 --> 01:10:41,278
to this fucking mansion.

1170
01:10:46,516 --> 01:10:49,143
Somebody must've intercepted it.

1171
01:10:53,149 --> 01:10:55,182
Son of a bitch.

1172
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:19,041
Oh, shit.

1173
01:11:19,076 --> 01:11:21,714
Santa, you okay?

1174
01:11:21,749 --> 01:11:23,485
Santa.

1175
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:25,619
A bunch of new bad guys
showed up.

1176
01:11:25,654 --> 01:11:27,621
They're on the naughty list.

1177
01:11:27,656 --> 01:11:30,393
They got their gadgets
and their gizmos on them.

1178
01:11:31,396 --> 01:11:33,858
I'm sorry.
I think this is it, kid.

1179
01:11:33,893 --> 01:11:35,629
No, no, don't say that.

1180
01:11:35,664 --> 01:11:37,631
The naughty list...

1181
01:11:37,666 --> 01:11:39,897
just grows and grows.

1182
01:11:48,842 --> 01:11:52,580
He's in that structure.
Body cams on.

1183
01:11:52,615 --> 01:11:54,681
Don't give up.

1184
01:11:54,716 --> 01:11:57,145
You make a wish this time,
Santa.

1185
01:11:57,180 --> 01:11:58,916
Just this once.

1186
01:11:58,951 --> 01:12:01,853
If you could have anything
in this world,

1187
01:12:01,888 --> 01:12:03,921
what would it be?

1188
01:12:09,863 --> 01:12:12,864
I wish I could see
Mrs. Claus again,

1189
01:12:12,899 --> 01:12:16,032
tell her how much I love her.

1190
01:12:16,067 --> 01:12:18,837
Then you make
that wish come true.

1191
01:12:18,872 --> 01:12:21,004
Oh, shit.

1192
01:12:21,039 --> 01:12:23,204
No, no, no, no. No, no.

1193
01:12:24,911 --> 01:12:26,372
Oh, God.

1194
01:12:26,407 --> 01:12:29,243
No.

1195
01:12:41,730 --> 01:12:44,698
You said these guys,
they're naughty.

1196
01:12:44,733 --> 01:12:47,602
And what do you do
to the naughty ones?

1197
01:12:47,637 --> 01:12:49,472
I give them a lump of coal.

1198
01:12:49,507 --> 01:12:51,573
Yeah. Give them their lumps.

1199
01:12:53,104 --> 01:12:55,137
Take that coal and shove it
straight up their...

1200
01:12:55,172 --> 01:12:57,480
- Anuses.
- Yeah!

1201
01:13:03,488 --> 01:13:04,982
They're right outside.

1202
01:13:19,537 --> 01:13:21,900
Santa's gonna eat
through these guys

1203
01:13:21,935 --> 01:13:23,803
like a plate full of cookies.

1204
01:13:28,469 --> 01:13:29,710
Move, move.

1205
01:13:33,551 --> 01:13:35,309
Hey, lock it up.

1206
01:13:37,181 --> 01:13:38,983
Lights down.

1207
01:13:40,184 --> 01:13:42,283
Stay at my back.

1208
01:13:42,318 --> 01:13:44,186
All right, we got this, boys.

1209
01:14:03,306 --> 01:14:05,515
All right, where the fuck
is my money?!

1210
01:14:05,550 --> 01:14:07,748
Where's the money?!

1211
01:14:18,827 --> 01:14:21,388
All right, I've been
a sweetheart up to now.

1212
01:14:21,423 --> 01:14:22,994
But that's all over.

1213
01:14:23,029 --> 01:14:24,699
No more fucking games!

1214
01:14:24,734 --> 01:14:26,360
Where's the money?

1215
01:14:26,395 --> 01:14:29,198
Or I will shoot every last
one of you and enjoy it.

1216
01:14:33,611 --> 01:14:36,238
- It's in the vault.
- I just looked in the vault.

1217
01:14:36,273 --> 01:14:37,745
Had the money been in there,

1218
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:39,340
I'd have a different
expression on my face.

1219
01:14:39,375 --> 01:14:40,814
Impossible.

1220
01:14:40,849 --> 01:14:42,882
Takes days to get
into that thing.

1221
01:14:42,917 --> 01:14:46,281
Not if we have the key,
Mrs. Lightstone.

1222
01:14:47,790 --> 01:14:49,823
Thorp.

1223
01:14:51,288 --> 01:14:53,728
You can't trust anyone
these days.

1224
01:14:53,763 --> 01:14:55,928
I'm not sure how, but you

1225
01:14:55,963 --> 01:14:58,832
or one of your shithead kids
moved the money.

1226
01:14:58,867 --> 01:15:00,669
And this upsets me.

1227
01:15:00,704 --> 01:15:02,704
It upsets me

1228
01:15:02,739 --> 01:15:06,466
in a way that makes me want to
just randomly shoot at people.

1229
01:15:07,469 --> 01:15:09,711
Hold on. Just... Sorry.

1230
01:15:09,746 --> 01:15:11,240
- Um...
- What? What?

1231
01:15:11,275 --> 01:15:12,714
Uh, what if you randomly shoot

1232
01:15:12,749 --> 01:15:14,980
the only person
who knows where it is?

1233
01:15:16,214 --> 01:15:18,346

Well, my wife has a fucking
gun to her head, so...

1296
01:19:02,176 --> 01:19:04,011
Yeah, how did you find out
that we were coming, huh?

1297
01:19:04,046 --> 01:19:05,606
I didn't. I was stealing it.

1298
01:19:07,049 --> 01:19:08,345
- Yeah, coincidence.
- Oh, my God.

1299
01:19:08,380 --> 01:19:09,852
I was planning to take the money

1300
01:19:09,887 --> 01:19:12,822
and leave with my wife
and daughter tonight

1301
01:19:12,857 --> 01:19:14,780
and never come back here.

1302
01:19:14,815 --> 01:19:18,289
Oh, and then my mom would, uh,

1303
01:19:18,324 --> 01:19:20,291
read the note with her whiskey
in the morning

1304
01:19:20,326 --> 01:19:21,996
and know what I had done.

1305
01:19:22,031 --> 01:19:24,361
For years,
I have been telling you

1306
01:19:24,396 --> 01:19:26,869
to stop caring about
your mother's fucking money!

1307
01:19:26,904 --> 01:19:29,971
And you think the solution
was to steal a bunch of it.

1308
01:19:30,974 --> 01:19:32,941
Well, it...
yeah, it does sound stupid

1309
01:19:32,976 --> 01:19:34,536
when you say it like that.

1310
01:19:34,571 --> 01:19:36,538
How can you do this right now?

1311
01:19:36,573 --> 01:19:38,672
It's disgusting. After all
that Mother has given us?

1312
01:19:38,707 --> 01:19:40,674
Come on, Alva.
Everything she ever gave you,

1313
01:19:40,709 --> 01:19:42,016
she made damn sure we knew

1314
01:19:42,051 --> 01:19:43,347
she had the power
to take right back.

1315
01:19:43,382 --> 01:19:47,186
I have spent years
groveling to you.

1316
01:19:47,221 --> 01:19:49,958
In the meanwhile,
I was destroying

1317
01:19:49,993 --> 01:19:51,993
the only good thing in my life.

1318
01:19:52,028 --> 01:19:53,489
What are we doing here, huh?

1319
01:19:53,524 --> 01:19:56,228
Family therapy or doing a heist?

1320
01:19:56,263 --> 01:19:59,330
- Yeah, enough of this sharing
bullshit. -

1321
01:19:59,365 --> 01:20:01,035
All right. Where'd you put it?

1322
01:20:07,505 --> 01:20:09,879
Look at this little idiot.

1323
01:20:13,742 --> 01:20:15,181
Oh, no.

1324
01:20:15,216 --> 01:20:16,985
What?

1325
01:20:17,020 --> 01:20:18,888
- The bad guys found me.
- Okay.

1326
01:20:18,923 --> 01:20:20,714
I'm coming.

1327
01:20:27,426 --> 01:20:31,098
You know, booby traps don't work
unless you hide them.

1328
01:20:33,938 --> 01:20:35,267

1329
01:20:38,602 --> 01:20:40,767

01:20:44,872 --> 01:20:46,773
Help me! Help me! Help!

1331
01:20:48,315 --> 01:20:50,447
You'll be f... You'll be fine.

1332
01:20:50,482 --> 01:20:52,449
Sit tight.
I'll be back in a sec.

this little piece of shit!

1336
01:21:53,215 --> 01:21:55,545
You're so fucking dead!

1337
01:22:02,818 --> 01:22:05,126
Fucking piece of shit.

1338
01:22:10,463 --> 01:22:12,969

Fuck.

1343
01:23:06,783 --> 01:23:08,387
Yeah? Heads up.

1344
01:23:10,787 --> 01:23:12,325
That's all you got?
You fucking...

01:23:15,132 --> 01:23:17,561

1346
01:23:43,259 --> 01:23:44,291

Hi, Trudy. Hi.

1348
01:23:56,767 --> 01:23:59,537
I made booby traps like
in the movie. It was so funny.

1349
01:23:59,572 --> 01:24:02,034
Ho, ho, ho.

1350
01:24:08,075 --> 01:24:11,813
Trudy, I want you to, uh...
just do me a favor.

1351
01:24:12,849 --> 01:24:15,751
Just turn around
and close your eyes.

1352
01:24:15,786 --> 01:24:18,490
Maybe put your fingers
in your ears and, uh,

1353
01:24:18,525 --> 01:24:21,592
sing "Jingle Bells"

So I get why you did
what you did.

1366
01:24:45,046 --> 01:24:47,112
When your grandfather told me
I'd never run the company

1367

doesn't have what it takes,

1370
01:24:52,988 --> 01:24:54,658
a Lightstone takes

1374
01:25:03,372 --> 01:25:06,274

presented him with gifts

1376
01:25:11,248 --> 01:25:14,315

Come on. Come on.
You don't want to kill us.

1389

Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

1395
01:25:53,917 --> 01:25:55,521
You got to kill
Aunt Linda first.

1396
01:25:55,556 --> 01:25:57,490
What the hell, Bert?

1397
01:25:57,525 --> 01:25:59,327
You want to squeeze in
being a little shit

1398
01:25:59,362 --> 01:26:00,988
before you die, Bertrude?

1399
01:26:01,023 --> 01:26:02,528
- I say shoot him first.
- What?

1400
01:26:02,563 --> 01:26:04,596
Wait. No, no, no.
Don't shoot him.

1401
01:26:04,631 --> 01:26:06,697
Don't shoot him first.
And don't you call him

1402
01:26:06,732 --> 01:26:08,336
a little shit,
you gold-digging bitch.

1403
01:26:08,371 --> 01:26:10,195
Okay. I changed my mind.

1404
01:26:10,230 --> 01:26:12,164
-Shoot the alcoholic bitch
first. -Don't call my mom

1405
01:26:12,199 --> 01:26:14,276
- an alcoholic bitch.
- Your mom's an alcoholic.

1406
01:26:14,311 --> 01:26:16,036
- I'm sorry.
- You're a gold-digging bitch.

1407
01:26:16,071 --> 01:26:18,280
Oh, I'm a gold-digger,
when I have a whole-ass career?

1408
01:26:18,315 --> 01:26:19,842
You're not even part
of the fucking family.

1409
01:26:19,877 --> 01:26:22,548
- She's an engineer.
- You know goddamn well...

1410
01:26:22,583 --> 01:26:23,780
Shut up!

1411
01:26:27,654 --> 01:26:31,557
Just like rats in a barrel.

1412
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:34,725
Why don't you die
with some dignity?

1413
01:26:39,798 --> 01:26:41,699
Get off of me!

1414
01:26:41,734 --> 01:26:43,371
Okay, okay.

1415
01:26:43,406 --> 01:26:44,702
Fuck you!

1416
01:26:44,737 --> 01:26:47,133
This is for yelling at my child!

1417
01:26:47,168 --> 01:26:48,640
Creep!

1418
01:26:48,675 --> 01:26:50,378
That's for slapping me,
motherfucker!

1419
01:26:50,413 --> 01:26:52,204
This is for
your dumb fucking hat!

1420
01:27:01,787 --> 01:27:03,589
Is he...

1421
01:27:03,624 --> 01:27:05,019
Is he dead?

1422
01:27:08,926 --> 01:27:10,761
Yeah.

1423
01:27:11,764 --> 01:27:13,467
Thanks, Linda.

1424
01:27:13,502 --> 01:27:16,470
Well, it's nice to do something
as a family for a change.

1425
01:27:17,770 --> 01:27:19,341
Oh, shit!

1426
01:27:19,376 --> 01:27:21,167
I'm gonna...

1427
01:27:25,349 --> 01:27:26,975
That was for Morgan.

1428
01:27:27,010 --> 01:27:31,782
He may have been stupid,
but he was very, very hot.

1429
01:27:33,214 --> 01:27:35,654
Oh. Trudy!

1430
01:27:35,689 --> 01:27:37,953
Mommy!

1431
01:27:37,988 --> 01:27:39,757
Thank God, baby.

1432
01:27:39,792 --> 01:27:41,627
Are you okay?

1433
01:27:41,662 --> 01:27:43,332
I'm okay, Mommy.

1434
01:27:43,367 --> 01:27:44,531
Okay.

1435
01:27:44,566 --> 01:27:46,962
This is my friend, Santa.

1436
01:27:51,474 --> 01:27:53,507
What the fuck?

1437
01:27:53,542 --> 01:27:55,344
I can't thank you enough,
Mister...

1438
01:27:55,379 --> 01:27:57,709
Claus. But please call me Santa.

1439
01:27:57,744 --> 01:27:59,205
Mm-hmm.

1440
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:01,108
You guys should get out of here.

1441
01:28:01,143 --> 01:28:02,681
It's dangerous.

1442
01:28:02,716 --> 01:28:04,881
They took my husband
and her grandmother.

1443
01:28:06,918 --> 01:28:08,456
Anybody know how to work
these gizmos?

1444
01:28:08,491 --> 01:28:09,853
I think so.

1445
01:28:09,888 --> 01:28:11,525
I used to hunt with my dad.

1446
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:12,724
Ow.

1447
01:28:12,759 --> 01:28:14,561
Copy that. How's that looking?

1448
01:28:14,596 --> 01:28:17,124
- Yeah, I got it on lockdown.
- Heads on a swivel, boys.

1449
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:20,061
- Incoming!
- Heads up!

1450
01:28:21,570 --> 01:28:22,998
Oh, oh! Who's shooting?

1451
01:28:23,033 --> 01:28:24,835
Who's...

1452
01:28:24,870 --> 01:28:27,574
- Cap, get down!
- Watch it! Watch it!

1453
01:28:32,911 --> 01:28:35,109
Gun 'em down. Mow them all down.

1454
01:28:51,193 --> 01:28:53,930
-All right, let's get the fuck
out of here. -Let's go.

1455
01:28:53,965 --> 01:28:56,372
- Go where?
- Come on, move, you old bat.

1456
01:28:57,298 --> 01:28:58,968
Get your fucking
hands off of me.

1457
01:29:09,145 --> 01:29:11,552
Oh! Oh, shit.

1458
01:29:11,587 --> 01:29:14,819
My balls! My fucking balls!

1459
01:29:31,838 --> 01:29:34,410
Ow, my balls! Why did you
shoot me in the ball...

1460
01:29:38,174 --> 01:29:40,614
Oh, Jesus.

1461
01:29:40,649 --> 01:29:42,209
Sorry.

1462
01:29:44,312 --> 01:29:46,818
Don't worry about us, Mr. Claus.
We got this.

1463
01:29:46,853 --> 01:29:49,150
Who is that guy?

1464
01:29:49,185 --> 01:29:51,493
He said he was Mr. Claus.

1465
01:29:53,453 --> 01:29:55,497
- Fuck. Trudy.
- No, no.

1466
01:29:55,532 --> 01:29:56,993
She's in the house. She's okay.

1467
01:29:57,028 --> 01:29:58,500
She's safe.

1468
01:29:58,535 --> 01:30:00,667
- Oh, thank God.
- Yeah.

1469
01:30:21,349 --> 01:30:22,920
No, no.

1470
01:30:22,955 --> 01:30:25,494
- Oh... go, go, go, go, go.
- No, no, no. Wait, wait.

1471
01:31:11,267 --> 01:31:13,575
Oh, shit!

1472
01:31:16,107 --> 01:31:18,613
Ho, ho!

1473
01:31:20,507 --> 01:31:21,550
Fuck!

1474
01:32:05,486 --> 01:32:07,827
Fucking die.

1475
01:33:01,278 --> 01:33:03,113
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1476
01:33:03,148 --> 01:33:06,182
Yeah, over here. Over here.

1477
01:33:06,217 --> 01:33:07,546
Santa!

1478
01:33:08,516 --> 01:33:10,285
Come on!

1479
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:11,858
Yeah.

1480
01:33:55,596 --> 01:33:56,672
Fuck.

1481
01:34:20,555 --> 01:34:22,588
You're real?

1482
01:34:24,064 --> 01:34:26,361
You're... him.

1483
01:34:29,366 --> 01:34:30,871
You're you.

1484
01:34:30,906 --> 01:34:33,500
That's what I've been trying
to tell you.

1485
01:34:33,535 --> 01:34:36,745
The real goddamn Santa Claus.

1486
01:34:36,780 --> 01:34:39,275
This is not your night, pal.

1487
01:34:39,310 --> 01:34:42,443
Oh, I don't know.
I think you're wrong.

1488
01:34:42,478 --> 01:34:45,754
I think my whole shitty life's
built up to this moment.

1489
01:34:45,789 --> 01:34:47,217
Because when I kill you,

1490
01:34:47,252 --> 01:34:50,385
this whole goddamn holiday
finally ends.

1491
01:34:52,290 --> 01:34:53,927
Whatever it takes...

1492
01:34:55,898 --> 01:34:57,931
Christmas dies tonight.

1493
01:35:50,282 --> 01:35:51,776
Whoa!

1494
01:37:17,105 --> 01:37:19,600
The last Christmas.

1495
01:37:29,645 --> 01:37:31,953
Not if you still believe.

1496
01:37:33,913 --> 01:37:35,924
No!

1497
01:38:04,185 --> 01:38:07,516
I have no idea what the fuck
is going on here.

1498
01:38:10,026 --> 01:38:11,927
But this ends now.

1499
01:38:17,099 --> 01:38:18,824
Damn right it does.

1500
01:38:28,044 --> 01:38:30,011
Trudy, be careful.

1501
01:38:33,874 --> 01:38:35,775
Santa!

1502
01:38:35,810 --> 01:38:38,151
Oh, no. Santa.

1503
01:38:39,715 --> 01:38:41,187
Oh, no.

1504
01:38:48,163 --> 01:38:50,130
You saved my daughter.

1505
01:38:51,133 --> 01:38:52,528
No.

1506
01:38:53,531 --> 01:38:55,003
She saved me.

1507
01:38:55,038 --> 01:38:57,929
Help him. Please help him.

1508
01:38:57,964 --> 01:39:00,305
Honey, I don't think
there's anything we can do.

1509
01:39:00,340 --> 01:39:01,636
It's okay. It's okay.

1510
01:39:01,671 --> 01:39:03,803
It's too late for that.

1511
01:39:03,838 --> 01:39:05,981
Too late.

1512
01:39:06,973 --> 01:39:09,776
I'm cold.

1513
01:39:09,811 --> 01:39:11,844
I haven't felt cold in years.

1514
01:39:11,879 --> 01:39:13,912
We need to keep him warm.

1515
01:39:14,981 --> 01:39:17,190
All of the fires are going out.

1516
01:39:17,225 --> 01:39:19,357
We need to find
something to burn.

1517
01:39:20,756 --> 01:39:22,195
I got an idea.

1518
01:39:25,365 --> 01:39:27,068
Whoa.

1519
01:39:28,731 --> 01:39:30,236
No.

1520
01:39:30,271 --> 01:39:32,469
No, no, no, no. No, Jason, no.

1521
01:39:32,504 --> 01:39:33,569
Please, Santa.

1522
01:39:33,604 --> 01:39:36,374
I don't want you to die.

1523
01:39:39,742 --> 01:39:41,346
Jason, let's slow this down.

1524
01:39:41,381 --> 01:39:42,974
What are you doing?

1525
01:39:43,009 --> 01:39:46,351
I've lived longer
than any man should ever live.

1526
01:39:46,386 --> 01:39:48,980
He's pretty much dead.
What the hell is happening?

1527
01:39:49,015 --> 01:39:51,059
- You don't need to burn money.
- Okay. More. Yeah.

1528
01:39:51,094 --> 01:39:54,392
You can't die, Santa.
You have to get up.

1529
01:39:54,427 --> 01:39:56,889
I think I used up
all my Christmas magic.

1530
01:39:57,859 --> 01:39:59,397
Sorry.

1531
01:40:01,731 --> 01:40:05,370
I'm s... I'm sorry I can't
give you what you asked for.

1532
01:40:06,868 --> 01:40:09,209
Take that. Take that.

1533
01:40:09,244 --> 01:40:10,639
But you did.

1534
01:40:13,611 --> 01:40:15,743
Santa, please don't die.

1535
01:40:15,778 --> 01:40:18,416
Wake up. Wake up.

1536
01:40:18,451 --> 01:40:21,012
We need to get him
close to the fire.

1537
01:40:21,047 --> 01:40:22,882
Jason.

1538
01:40:23,819 --> 01:40:25,555
Just wake up.

1539
01:40:26,591 --> 01:40:28,019
Please.

1540
01:40:28,054 --> 01:40:29,922
No.

1541
01:40:34,302 --> 01:40:37,402
Oh, I am so, so sorry.

1542
01:40:42,508 --> 01:40:45,179
This man...

1543
01:40:46,248 --> 01:40:49,744
This brave, brave man,
whoever he was...

1544
01:40:49,779 --> 01:40:51,075
He's Santa.

1545
01:40:51,110 --> 01:40:53,418
The real Santa. He is.

1546
01:40:53,453 --> 01:40:56,322
And I still believe in him.

1547
01:40:57,325 --> 01:40:59,952
I'll always believe in you,
Santa.

1548
01:41:04,695 --> 01:41:06,431
I believe in him, too.

1549
01:41:09,667 --> 01:41:12,437
He saved Trudy.

1550
01:41:12,472 --> 01:41:14,538
He saved our family.

1551
01:41:16,707 --> 01:41:18,872
What's realer than that?

1552
01:41:22,845 --> 01:41:24,614
Then maybe...

1553
01:41:27,223 --> 01:41:29,157
I believe in him, too.

1554
01:41:30,149 --> 01:41:31,621
So do I.

1555
01:41:32,657 --> 01:41:36,021
Oh, shit.

1556
01:41:36,056 --> 01:41:38,199
I guess...

1557
01:41:38,234 --> 01:41:40,300
I guess I do, too.

1558
01:41:40,335 --> 01:41:42,093
Fuck me.

1559
01:41:42,128 --> 01:41:43,864
I believe, too.

1560
01:41:54,382 --> 01:41:55,810
Oh, my God.

1561
01:41:55,845 --> 01:41:57,042
Santa!

1562
01:42:02,049 --> 01:42:03,488
You...

1563
01:42:05,426 --> 01:42:07,228
You were dead.

1564
01:42:08,231 --> 01:42:10,891
Christmas magic.

1565
01:42:10,926 --> 01:42:13,465
I still don't really
understand...

1566
01:42:13,500 --> 01:42:15,170
how it works.

1567
01:42:20,936 --> 01:42:23,068
Thank you.

1568
01:42:23,103 --> 01:42:25,136
I don't know
how we can ever repay you.

1569
01:42:25,171 --> 01:42:27,072
Well, you brought me back
from the dead,

1570
01:42:27,107 --> 01:42:28,579
so we'll call it even.

1571
01:42:29,846 --> 01:42:31,318
Even?

1572
01:42:31,353 --> 01:42:33,683
We just burned
half a million dollars.

1573
01:42:34,719 --> 01:42:36,180
- Look, Santa!
- Hmm?

1574
01:42:36,215 --> 01:42:37,687
Look who came.

1575
01:42:44,927 --> 01:42:48,335
Now you show up, huh?

1576
01:42:48,370 --> 01:42:49,897
You leave me here to die,

1577
01:42:49,932 --> 01:42:52,196
come back after
all the work's done, huh?

1578
01:42:52,231 --> 01:42:54,902
You know what? I should make
you guys into a stew

1579
01:42:54,937 --> 01:42:56,937
and feed you to the elves!

1580
01:42:59,205 --> 01:43:03,845
Yes, Blitzen!
Yes, I'm talking to you!

1581
01:43:03,880 --> 01:43:05,781
You, too, Prancer.

1582
01:43:11,250 --> 01:43:13,558
You got my sack.

1583
01:43:13,593 --> 01:43:17,430
My spare... You went home
and you got my spare sack?

1584
01:43:19,566 --> 01:43:22,193
Oh, God, I can't stay mad
at you guys.

1585
01:43:22,228 --> 01:43:23,931
I...

1586
01:43:23,966 --> 01:43:28,133
Aw. I can't. I can't.

1587
01:43:28,168 --> 01:43:30,905
Aw.

1588
01:43:31,941 --> 01:43:34,040
Aw.

1589
01:43:44,954 --> 01:43:46,591
Hello, beautiful.

1590
01:43:46,626 --> 01:43:48,296
Skullcrusher!

1591
01:44:01,509 --> 01:44:03,102
Guess this is goodbye.

1592
01:44:03,137 --> 01:44:04,444
I got to go.

1593
01:44:05,546 --> 01:44:07,447
Do you have to?

1594
01:44:11,046 --> 01:44:13,244
It's Christmas Eve,
