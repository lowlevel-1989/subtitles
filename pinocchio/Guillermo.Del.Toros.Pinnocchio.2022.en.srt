1
00:00:45,084 --> 00:00:48,001
<i>By the time</i>
<i>Master Geppetto made Pinocchio,</i>

2
00:00:48,084 --> 00:00:49,959
<i>he had already lost a son.</i>

3
00:00:52,876 --> 00:00:55,376
<i>Now this was quite a few years</i>
<i>before my time,</i>

4
00:00:55,959 --> 00:00:57,459
<i>but I learnt the story.</i>

5
00:00:57,959 --> 00:00:59,501
<i>And then it became my story.</i>

6
00:01:03,751 --> 00:01:06,834
<i>Geppetto lost Carlo during the Great War.</i>

7
00:01:07,418 --> 00:01:09,626
<i>They'd been together only ten years.</i>

8
00:01:11,209 --> 00:01:15,459
<i>But it was as if Carlo had taken</i>
<i>the old man's life with him.</i>

9
00:01:28,876 --> 00:01:30,209
Whoa.

10
00:01:33,668 --> 00:01:34,876
Whoa!

11
00:01:44,876 --> 00:01:46,459
-Papa! Papa!
-Yes?

12
00:01:46,543 --> 00:01:48,459
-Guess what I saw?
-What?

13
00:01:48,543 --> 00:01:50,584
-Guess!
-I've no idea.

14
00:01:50,668 --> 00:01:54,376
-I saw some planes!
-Oh, did you? Good.

15
00:01:55,334 --> 00:01:58,334
-What is it you're making this time, Papa?
-Guess!

16
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:00,876
-A soldier? A magician? A witch?
-No.

17
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,459
No! No, no, no, no, no,
you have to wait and see, Carlo!

18
00:02:04,543 --> 00:02:07,959
-All good things require patience.

19
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:09,334
Huh.

20
00:02:12,293 --> 00:02:13,668
<i>They wanted for nothing.</i>

21
00:02:13,751 --> 00:02:17,293
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

22
00:02:17,376 --> 00:02:19,876
<i>All they needed</i>
<i>was each other's company.</i>

23
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:23,876
And the old witch
warned the little hedgehog,

24
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:30,626
"Do not tell lies,
or your nose will grow and grow

25
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:31,834
up to here!"

26
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:36,126
His nose would grow?

27
00:02:36,751 --> 00:02:41,084
Lies, my dear boy,
are found out immediately

28
00:02:41,168 --> 00:02:43,459
because they are like long noses,

29
00:02:43,543 --> 00:02:47,626
visible to all but the teller of the lie.

30
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:52,251
And the more you lie, the more it grows!

31
00:02:59,126 --> 00:03:02,626
Sing me Mama's song so I can sleep.
Please, Papa?

32
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:04,834
All right.

33
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:31,501
-Higher, Papa! Higher!

34
00:03:44,751 --> 00:03:45,751
Try it.

35
00:03:50,043 --> 00:03:54,251
-Thank you, ladies.

36
00:04:01,084 --> 00:04:03,584
-For you.

37
00:04:03,668 --> 00:04:05,709
-For me?

38
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:30,709
Pull, Carlo! Pull!

39
00:04:30,793 --> 00:04:34,126
-Magnificent job, Geppetto.

40
00:04:34,209 --> 00:04:35,709
-Thank you.

41
00:04:42,584 --> 00:04:43,834
Watch out, Carlo!

42
00:04:50,168 --> 00:04:53,209
When one life is lost,
another must grow.

43
00:04:54,459 --> 00:04:55,793
How about this one?

44
00:04:57,334 --> 00:04:59,251
No, no, no, no, Carlo.

45
00:04:59,334 --> 00:05:01,418
It has to be perfect. Complete!

46
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:02,501
See?

47
00:05:03,584 --> 00:05:06,376
This one's missing some of its scales.

48
00:05:36,876 --> 00:05:38,209
Good night, Papa.

49
00:05:40,251 --> 00:05:41,751
Good night, my son.

50
00:05:44,251 --> 00:05:46,168
I love my new shoes, Papa!

51
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,668
I am very glad, Carlo.

52
00:05:49,334 --> 00:05:52,376
-We're going to church first, right?
-Oh, yes. Yes.

53
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:56,251
Hello there, little dog!

54
00:05:59,834 --> 00:06:01,834
<i>Buongiorno, Geppetto.</i>

55
00:06:03,043 --> 00:06:04,959
-Morning!
-Morning.

56
00:06:05,043 --> 00:06:08,793
Master Geppetto,
you gonna finish the crucifix today?

57
00:06:08,876 --> 00:06:10,376
We're gonna do our best.

58
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:14,376
-Ladies.
-Aw, such a perfectionist.

59
00:06:18,251 --> 00:06:20,376
A model Italian citizen.

60
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:21,959
And such a good father.

61
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:27,751
Carlo, nice shoes. Catch!

62
00:06:28,251 --> 00:06:29,251
Thank you, sir!

63
00:06:29,334 --> 00:06:30,793
-Good morning.
-Hi!

64
00:06:33,084 --> 00:06:36,584
-<i>Buongiorno.</i>
-<i>Buongiorno, Dottore!</i>

65
00:06:40,126 --> 00:06:41,668
Ah, Carlo.

66
00:06:43,543 --> 00:06:44,626
Geppetto.

67
00:06:56,543 --> 00:06:57,376
Yes…

68
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:59,084
-It looks great, Papa.
-Oh.

69
00:06:59,668 --> 00:07:01,709
Is it almost time to go home?

70
00:07:02,293 --> 00:07:03,251
Almost!

71
00:07:03,334 --> 00:07:06,293
-Send up a little more red for me, Carlo.

72
00:07:16,584 --> 00:07:18,918
Oh! I forgot to show you what I found.

73
00:07:19,001 --> 00:07:20,209
What is it, my boy?

74
00:07:21,584 --> 00:07:22,584
You'll see.

75
00:07:28,751 --> 00:07:31,126
-Ta-da!

76
00:07:31,668 --> 00:07:34,001
The perfect pine cone.

77
00:07:34,501 --> 00:07:36,043
It still has all its scales!

78
00:07:36,126 --> 00:07:39,418
I thought I could plant it myself
and watch the tree grow.

79
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:43,459
And then carve toys for myself.
Like you do.

80
00:07:43,543 --> 00:07:48,918
I think that's as good an idea
as any boy ever had, Carlo.

81
00:07:51,543 --> 00:07:52,543
Isn't it?

82
00:07:58,251 --> 00:08:00,876
What's that sound, Papa? Is it a plane?

83
00:08:03,543 --> 00:08:04,584
Gather the tools.

84
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:06,001
Quickly.

85
00:08:06,918 --> 00:08:11,959
We'll go home to a warm fire and hot soup.

86
00:08:12,043 --> 00:08:14,584
-Could we have some hot chocolate too?
-Sure. Sure.

87
00:08:14,668 --> 00:08:17,626
It seems like a hot chocolate sort of day,
doesn't it?

88
00:08:17,709 --> 00:08:19,626
Oh, yes, yes, yes. Fine.

89
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:21,876
Papa! What is it?

90
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,543
Nothing. I'm sure it's nothing but…

91
00:08:25,126 --> 00:08:26,626
Oh, wait. My pine cone!

92
00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:38,709
<i>It was later said Geppetto's</i>
<i>little town was not even a target.</i>

93
00:08:41,043 --> 00:08:43,126
<i>That these planes</i>
<i>were heading back to base</i>

94
00:08:44,168 --> 00:08:47,459
<i>and simply let go of their bombs</i>
<i>to make their ballasts lighter.</i>

95
00:08:56,501 --> 00:08:57,334
Carlo!

96
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:05,126
Ah!

97
00:09:15,668 --> 00:09:18,501
Huh?

98
00:09:22,001 --> 00:09:23,709
Huh?

99
00:09:25,251 --> 00:09:26,251
No…

100
00:09:33,001 --> 00:09:34,084
Carlo.

101
00:10:16,668 --> 00:10:21,084
<i>Geppetto never left his side.</i>
<i>And that was that.</i>

102
00:10:21,918 --> 00:10:25,418
<i>He worked very little. He ate even less.</i>

103
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:29,668
<i>And the church's crucifix</i>
<i>remained unfinished.</i>

104
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:37,001
-<i>The years passed.</i>

105
00:10:40,709 --> 00:10:42,126
<i>The world moved on…</i>

106
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:47,126
<i>but Geppetto did not.</i>

107
00:11:02,126 --> 00:11:04,251
<i>And this is where I come in.</i>

108
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,376
<i>You see, I was a writer.</i>

109
00:11:10,459 --> 00:11:13,001
<i>And for years, I'd been looking</i>
<i>for the ideal conditions to set</i>

110
00:11:13,084 --> 00:11:16,584
<i>my illustrious,</i>
<i>fascinating life story to paper.</i>

111
00:11:24,501 --> 00:11:25,793
<i>Until, at long last,</i>

112
00:11:27,126 --> 00:11:28,293
<i>I found it.</i>

113
00:11:31,293 --> 00:11:33,001
<i>My sanctuary.</i>

114
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:34,543
<i>Home.</i>

115
00:11:34,626 --> 00:11:35,709
Ah.

116
00:11:35,793 --> 00:11:40,168
<i>Here I could write my memoirs.</i>
<i>And what a tale it would be.</i>

117
00:11:41,584 --> 00:11:44,376
<i>I had lived</i>
<i>in a barrister's fireplace in Sardinia,</i>

118
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:46,751
<i>sailed on the Adriatic in a fishing boat,</i>

119
00:11:46,834 --> 00:11:50,959
<i>nested one Perugian winter</i>
<i>with an acclaimed sculptor.</i>

120
00:11:53,168 --> 00:11:55,668
Stridulations of My Youth

121
00:11:56,293 --> 00:11:58,751
<i>by Sebastian J. Cricket.</i>

122
00:12:01,584 --> 00:12:04,043
I dreamed of you, Carlo.

123
00:12:07,168 --> 00:12:11,876
I dreamed you were
right back here with me.

124
00:12:14,251 --> 00:12:15,251
My son.

125
00:12:18,126 --> 00:12:19,126
Oh dear.

126
00:12:21,793 --> 00:12:24,793
If only I could have you back.

127
00:12:24,876 --> 00:12:26,459
I am so sorry.

128
00:12:28,668 --> 00:12:32,084
<i>I watched the old man weep.</i>
<i>And it moved me.</i>

129
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:35,876
<i>And it turns out</i>
<i>that I wasn't the only one watching him.</i>

130
00:12:38,834 --> 00:12:41,209
<i>In my many wanderings on this earth,</i>

131
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:46,126
<i>I've learned that there are old spirits</i>
<i>living in the mountains, in the forests,</i>

132
00:12:46,209 --> 00:12:49,126
<i>who rarely involve themselves</i>
<i>in the human world.</i>

133
00:12:49,209 --> 00:12:51,543
<i>But on occasion, they do.</i>

134
00:12:53,251 --> 00:12:55,251
I want you back, Carlo.

135
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,334
Right here!

136
00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:01,584
With me!

137
00:13:02,876 --> 00:13:06,251
-Why won't you listen to my prayers?

138
00:13:06,334 --> 00:13:08,043
Why?

139
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,251
Where were we?

140
00:13:15,001 --> 00:13:16,793
Ah yes. Perug--

141
00:13:16,876 --> 00:13:18,459
-Whoa!

142
00:13:18,543 --> 00:13:19,918
What in my antennae?

143
00:13:23,084 --> 00:13:25,918
I will have him back.

144
00:13:26,001 --> 00:13:30,209
I'll make Carlo again…

145
00:13:30,293 --> 00:13:31,793
Wha-- Hey!

146
00:13:31,876 --> 00:13:35,084
…out of this accursed pine!

147
00:13:37,126 --> 00:13:39,501
Whoa! Ah!

148
00:14:00,793 --> 00:14:02,626
-What on earth?!

149
00:14:03,668 --> 00:14:04,834
No!

150
00:14:10,876 --> 00:14:12,918
-Ah! Ooh! Yah!

151
00:14:13,001 --> 00:14:15,334
It's a house of horrors!

152
00:14:26,876 --> 00:14:28,043
Ah!

153
00:14:29,918 --> 00:14:30,918
Ah!

154
00:14:31,626 --> 00:14:32,959
Ah!

155
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,709
Huh?

156
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:34,418
I… I will finish you tomorrow.

157
00:15:35,084 --> 00:15:37,209
Yes, tomorrow.

158
00:15:42,918 --> 00:15:44,793
Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!

159
00:15:44,876 --> 00:15:46,709
Hey! Get away from there. Go away!

160
00:15:48,543 --> 00:15:49,751
Bugger off.

161
00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:53,251
No, no, no, no, no, no. This is my home!

162
00:15:53,334 --> 00:15:54,918
No trespassing. Go! Go! Go! Go!

163
00:15:55,001 --> 00:15:57,626
Get away from here. Go away! Go away!

164
00:15:57,709 --> 00:15:58,793
Yes, that's right.

165
00:16:25,626 --> 00:16:27,501
Little wooden boy,

166
00:16:27,584 --> 00:16:32,043
may you rise with the sun
and walk the earth.

167
00:16:32,126 --> 00:16:35,876
Excuse me. Can I help you?
This is my home we're talking about.

168
00:16:37,501 --> 00:16:40,459
May I ask, who on earth are you?

169
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:42,543
On earth?

170
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:43,793
A guardian.

171
00:16:43,876 --> 00:16:46,376
-I care for the little things…

172
00:16:46,459 --> 00:16:47,918
…the forgotten things,

173
00:16:48,001 --> 00:16:49,293
the lost ones.

174
00:16:49,376 --> 00:16:52,793
Well, I am
Sebastian J. Cricket, homeowner.

175
00:16:52,876 --> 00:16:56,543
And I have every right to be consulted
about your schemes and machinations

176
00:16:56,626 --> 00:16:58,376
regarding my property.

177
00:16:58,459 --> 00:17:03,209
Well, since you already live
in the heart of the wooden boy,

178
00:17:03,293 --> 00:17:04,668
perhaps you can help me.

179
00:17:05,251 --> 00:17:06,209
Help you what?

180
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:08,168
To watch over him.

181
00:17:08,668 --> 00:17:10,751
Guide him to be good.

182
00:17:10,834 --> 00:17:12,668
I'm not a governess, madam.

183
00:17:12,751 --> 00:17:15,293
I'm a novelist, a raconteur,

184
00:17:15,376 --> 00:17:18,084
currently immersed in writing my memoirs.

185
00:17:18,168 --> 00:17:22,584
Well, in this world,
you get what you give.

186
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:27,918
Take on this responsibility,
and I will grant you one wish.

187
00:17:28,001 --> 00:17:30,334
And that could be anything?

188
00:17:30,418 --> 00:17:31,668
Anything at all?

189
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:33,501
The publication of my book?

190
00:17:33,584 --> 00:17:34,918
Fame? Fortune?

191
00:17:35,001 --> 00:17:36,334
Anything.

192
00:17:36,418 --> 00:17:37,251
Oh.

193
00:17:37,334 --> 00:17:41,418
Maybe I can help. I'll try my best,
and that's the best anyone can do.

194
00:17:42,001 --> 00:17:43,668
That's rather clever, isn't it?

195
00:17:44,626 --> 00:17:47,293
Little wooden boy made of pine,

196
00:17:48,459 --> 00:17:51,918
we shall call you Pinocchio.

197
00:17:52,501 --> 00:17:54,293
May you rise with the sun

198
00:17:55,626 --> 00:17:57,418
and wander the earth…

199
00:17:58,293 --> 00:17:59,584
Ah!

200
00:18:03,293 --> 00:18:08,209
…and bring joy and company
to that poor heartbroken man.

201
00:18:09,126 --> 00:18:10,293
Be his son.

202
00:18:11,126 --> 00:18:16,668
Fill his days with light
so he'll never be alone.

203
00:18:36,084 --> 00:18:37,001
Ah.

204
00:18:50,793 --> 00:18:51,668
Huh.

205
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:23,418
Who goes there?

206
00:19:27,251 --> 00:19:29,501
I'm… I'm warning you!

207
00:19:32,793 --> 00:19:34,459
I… I have a weapon!

208
00:19:43,001 --> 00:19:44,418
-Wha--

209
00:19:51,543 --> 00:19:53,918
Good morning, Papa!

210
00:19:55,293 --> 00:19:58,043
What is this? What kind of sorcery?

211
00:19:58,126 --> 00:20:01,709
You wanted me to live.
You asked for me to live.

212
00:20:01,793 --> 00:20:03,126
Who… Who are you?

213
00:20:05,418 --> 00:20:07,668
My name is Pinocchio!

214
00:20:07,751 --> 00:20:09,126
I'm your son!

215
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:12,543
You are not my son! Don't come near me!

216
00:20:12,626 --> 00:20:14,501
The boy's telling the truth,
Master Geppetto!

217
00:20:14,584 --> 00:20:16,918
It's full of cockroaches!

218
00:20:17,418 --> 00:20:18,626
Ah!

219
00:20:21,376 --> 00:20:22,876
Ugh.

220
00:20:23,668 --> 00:20:24,626
Ah!

221
00:20:42,459 --> 00:20:43,834
Wow!

222
00:20:43,918 --> 00:20:45,334
Ah! Huh?

223
00:20:46,418 --> 00:20:48,334
What is this?

224
00:20:54,293 --> 00:20:56,751
Huh? No, no, get away from me!

225
00:21:00,376 --> 00:21:02,959
You… You stand back! Don't come near me!

226
00:21:09,709 --> 00:21:12,043
It's a clock. Don't touch it.

227
00:21:13,918 --> 00:21:16,126
It sings at six o'clock.

228
00:21:19,459 --> 00:21:21,459
No! Ah!

229
00:21:27,876 --> 00:21:29,084
That's a hammer.

230
00:21:31,751 --> 00:21:33,793
You tap. You smash. You shatter.

231
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:36,251
-Ugh!

232
00:22:06,043 --> 00:22:09,876
-Uh, a ch… chamber pot.

233
00:22:10,459 --> 00:22:14,084
-Um, uh, I… Oh.

234
00:22:17,626 --> 00:22:18,834
-Ah!

235
00:22:29,251 --> 00:22:31,376
-Don't…

236
00:22:34,876 --> 00:22:36,001
You must stop!

237
00:22:38,543 --> 00:22:41,459
That was so much fun, Papa!

238
00:22:41,543 --> 00:22:43,668
You're not my son!

239
00:22:48,459 --> 00:22:50,293
What is wrong with you?

240
00:22:51,668 --> 00:22:52,584
Papa?

241
00:22:54,334 --> 00:22:55,459
I'm sorry.

242
00:23:14,668 --> 00:23:16,126
I, uh…

243
00:23:19,584 --> 00:23:22,543
Just stay here. Don't come out.

244
00:23:24,209 --> 00:23:25,709
Time for church.

245
00:23:25,793 --> 00:23:28,418
-Church? I wanna go to church.
Stay there.

246
00:23:28,501 --> 00:23:30,376
-Church! Church!
-Do you understand?

247
00:23:30,459 --> 00:23:32,334
Church! Church! Church! Church!

248
00:23:33,668 --> 00:23:34,543
Church!

249
00:23:34,626 --> 00:23:36,709
No, no, he told you to stay.

250
00:23:36,793 --> 00:23:41,501
-I'm going to church! I'm going to church!
-No, no, no! Please, stop!

251
00:23:41,584 --> 00:23:42,751
You must obey your papa.

252
00:23:43,751 --> 00:23:44,584
Obey?

253
00:23:44,668 --> 00:23:46,543
To do as you're told!

254
00:23:46,626 --> 00:23:48,626
But I don't want to obey!

255
00:23:48,709 --> 00:23:50,751
Well…

256
00:23:50,834 --> 00:23:54,751
…you must try your best,
and that's the best anybody can do.

257
00:23:58,376 --> 00:24:00,793
-I'm going to church!

258
00:24:00,876 --> 00:24:03,459
I'm going to church!

259
00:24:09,084 --> 00:24:10,168
Whoa!

260
00:24:16,043 --> 00:24:17,751
-Hi!

261
00:24:19,001 --> 00:24:20,168
Okay, bye!

262
00:24:22,126 --> 00:24:23,001
Hmm.

263
00:24:24,043 --> 00:24:25,834
Oops.

264
00:24:26,709 --> 00:24:28,709
Uh, uh, ah!

265
00:25:04,459 --> 00:25:07,626
-Look, Father, over there!

266
00:25:07,709 --> 00:25:09,084
What is that?

267
00:25:11,459 --> 00:25:12,293
Papa!

268
00:25:12,376 --> 00:25:14,584
-It speaks!

269
00:25:16,418 --> 00:25:18,834
Papa! Papa! Over here!

270
00:25:18,918 --> 00:25:20,209
Pinocchio.

271
00:25:20,293 --> 00:25:21,626
It's me!

272
00:25:21,709 --> 00:25:23,793
I came to church.

273
00:25:23,876 --> 00:25:26,501
-It's a demon!
-Witchcraft!

274
00:25:26,584 --> 00:25:27,501
<i>Malocchio!</i>

275
00:25:27,584 --> 00:25:28,709
Pinocchio.

276
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:30,668
No! No, please!

277
00:25:30,751 --> 00:25:33,668
It's… It's a puppet
to… to entertain!

278
00:25:33,751 --> 00:25:36,126
If he's a puppet, where are his strings?

279
00:25:36,209 --> 00:25:39,209
That's true. Who controls you, wooden boy?

280
00:25:39,293 --> 00:25:41,293
Of course, I control him--

281
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,751
Who controls you?

282
00:25:45,876 --> 00:25:49,709
No one talks to the Podesta like that.

283
00:25:49,793 --> 00:25:52,084
He… He's a puppet. Just a puppet!

284
00:25:52,168 --> 00:25:56,084
No, I'm not. I'm made
of flesh and bone and meaty bits!

285
00:25:56,168 --> 00:25:58,751
-I'm a real boy!

286
00:25:58,834 --> 00:26:01,001
-A monster!
-Demon!

287
00:26:01,084 --> 00:26:04,126
-It's an abomination.

288
00:26:04,209 --> 00:26:07,501
-This is the work of the devil!
-Enough!

289
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:11,626
This is a house of God.

290
00:26:11,709 --> 00:26:13,084
You drunken fool!

291
00:26:13,168 --> 00:26:14,834
You carving this… this thing

292
00:26:14,918 --> 00:26:18,209
while our blessed Christ
hangs unfinished all these years?

293
00:26:18,293 --> 00:26:21,793
Take that unholy thing away.
Take it away! Now!

294
00:26:23,543 --> 00:26:24,751
Yes. Yes, Padre.

295
00:26:24,834 --> 00:26:26,876
-Shame on you, Geppetto!
-Burn him!

296
00:26:26,959 --> 00:26:28,251
-So sorry.
-Chop him up!

297
00:26:28,334 --> 00:26:29,668
-Oh <i>Dio mio.</i>
-Sorry, sorry.

298
00:26:29,751 --> 00:26:31,251
-He'll be fine.

299
00:26:31,334 --> 00:26:34,584
-Curse you, Geppetto!
- The Lord will punish him!

300
00:26:34,668 --> 00:26:36,751
-Get out!

301
00:26:42,668 --> 00:26:45,209
-Stop fidgeting, please.
-Hello!

302
00:26:51,251 --> 00:26:53,834
Carlo never acted like this.

303
00:26:53,918 --> 00:26:57,001
Papa, why did my nose grow today?

304
00:26:58,501 --> 00:27:00,293
You lied, Pinocchio,

305
00:27:00,376 --> 00:27:05,293
and a lie is plain to see
as your nose and--

306
00:27:05,376 --> 00:27:08,418
And the more you lie, the more it grows.

307
00:27:09,043 --> 00:27:11,126
-Is that it?
-That…

308
00:27:11,209 --> 00:27:13,709
-Yes, that's it.

309
00:27:26,209 --> 00:27:28,209
-There you go.
-Chocolate.

310
00:27:28,293 --> 00:27:30,043
-Thank you, Geppetto.

311
00:27:30,126 --> 00:27:32,376
We appreciate your hospitality.

312
00:27:32,459 --> 00:27:34,793
Candlewick, go sit by the fire.

313
00:27:35,376 --> 00:27:40,043
We are here to talk about
the incident at the church today.

314
00:27:41,001 --> 00:27:44,293
The community was startled
by your creation.

315
00:27:44,376 --> 00:27:45,709
As Podesta,

316
00:27:45,793 --> 00:27:50,501
I must ensure that this puppet of yours
poses no threat to our community.

317
00:27:50,584 --> 00:27:52,626
Oh, no, no, nothing like that.

318
00:27:52,709 --> 00:27:54,668
Oh! Is that

319
00:27:55,668 --> 00:27:57,001
hot chocolate?

320
00:27:57,668 --> 00:28:00,459
You're a puppet!
You've never eaten anything in your life!

321
00:28:00,543 --> 00:28:04,418
Oh! Oh, that must be why I'm so hungry!

322
00:28:05,043 --> 00:28:08,376
Oh, I'm starving, Papa.
I'm starving to death!

323
00:28:08,459 --> 00:28:09,501
You are not!

324
00:28:09,584 --> 00:28:13,334
Now go sit by the fire
and let me talk to our guests.

325
00:28:13,418 --> 00:28:16,043
But I don't want to! I want hot chocolate!

326
00:28:16,126 --> 00:28:19,126
-Please, Papa. Please! Please! Please!
-There, there now.

327
00:28:19,209 --> 00:28:20,251
Here you go.

328
00:28:20,334 --> 00:28:23,584
Oh boy! Thank you! Thank you!
Thank you! Thank you!

329
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:27,876
Yes. Yes, Pinocchio.
Go… Go warm your feet by the fire.

330
00:28:27,959 --> 00:28:29,418
Obey your papa.

331
00:28:29,501 --> 00:28:32,959
Oh yes, I will obey if I get chocolate.

332
00:28:33,043 --> 00:28:35,084
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!

333
00:28:35,834 --> 00:28:38,834
He really is a charming boy.

334
00:28:38,918 --> 00:28:43,376
Podesta watches over the town's
moral well-being, you understand?

335
00:28:43,876 --> 00:28:46,251
His authority cannot be questioned--

336
00:28:46,334 --> 00:28:48,668
That's right!
And I won't be mocked!

337
00:28:48,751 --> 00:28:52,043
I will do just as you wish.
You have my word.

338
00:28:54,043 --> 00:28:55,959
-So, what about this wooden boy?
-Ah.

339
00:28:56,043 --> 00:28:58,501
Will you let him run wild
through town all day?

340
00:28:58,584 --> 00:29:02,293
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
I'll keep him locked up!

341
00:29:02,376 --> 00:29:03,501
Right here in the house.

342
00:29:03,584 --> 00:29:05,209
I won't be locked up.

343
00:29:05,293 --> 00:29:07,709
I'll smash the windows out, I will.

344
00:29:07,793 --> 00:29:10,501
This abnormal boy lacks discipline.

345
00:29:11,084 --> 00:29:16,209
But he seems strong, sturdy,
made of good Italian pine.

346
00:29:16,293 --> 00:29:18,668
-Oh, very good pine, yes.

347
00:29:18,751 --> 00:29:22,168
Not perfect, you see,
but, uh, he means well.

348
00:29:22,709 --> 00:29:26,626
Hey. Try to get closer to the fire
to get warm.

349
00:29:26,709 --> 00:29:28,001
Son, come here.

350
00:29:34,543 --> 00:29:36,293
Look at my boy, Candlewick.

351
00:29:36,376 --> 00:29:37,293
Yes. Yes.

352
00:29:37,376 --> 00:29:38,709
A model fascist youth.

353
00:29:39,209 --> 00:29:40,626
Proud and brave.

354
00:29:41,126 --> 00:29:43,209
Virile, like his father.

355
00:29:43,293 --> 00:29:47,376
And his teeth, perfect teeth.
And no sign of jaundice.

356
00:29:47,459 --> 00:29:49,084
Papa? Papa!

357
00:29:49,168 --> 00:29:51,793
My feet feel hot, like chocolate.

358
00:29:51,876 --> 00:29:52,793
Look!

359
00:29:53,876 --> 00:29:55,293
Ah! What?!

360
00:29:55,918 --> 00:29:58,251
Fire! My house is on fire!

361
00:29:58,334 --> 00:30:01,793
-Yes! Look at me!

362
00:30:01,876 --> 00:30:06,209
Look! I'm on fire! Yay!

363
00:30:08,334 --> 00:30:12,959
Aw. Look what you did, Papa.
You've ruined the nice light on my feet.

364
00:30:13,043 --> 00:30:15,751
This is what you get
with an undisciplined mind.

365
00:30:15,834 --> 00:30:17,918
You must send this child to school.

366
00:30:18,418 --> 00:30:21,084
To school? Pinocchio?

367
00:30:21,168 --> 00:30:23,293
Yes. Tomorrow.

368
00:30:26,376 --> 00:30:28,334
School.

369
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:37,251
Oh, what a day. What a day.

370
00:30:37,334 --> 00:30:40,001
Oh, what a day. What a day.

371
00:30:41,543 --> 00:30:42,876
Time for bed.

372
00:30:48,084 --> 00:30:53,418
You know, Papa, I like my old legs.
And I like them on fire.

373
00:30:53,501 --> 00:30:55,584
Pinocchio, if you go to sleep,

374
00:30:55,668 --> 00:30:58,626
I'll make you a new pair of legs
in the morning.

375
00:30:58,709 --> 00:31:00,418
Just like the old ones?

376
00:31:00,501 --> 00:31:03,209
Better than the old ones.

377
00:31:03,293 --> 00:31:07,251
Better? Can I have cricket legs, Papa?
Can you make me four of them?

378
00:31:07,334 --> 00:31:10,084
No, no, no, no. No, just two.

379
00:31:10,709 --> 00:31:12,376
Two will do.

380
00:31:14,959 --> 00:31:16,293
Good night, Papa.

381
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:18,834
Good night, my…

382
00:31:19,751 --> 00:31:22,793
Good night, Pinocchio.

383
00:31:27,126 --> 00:31:28,376
Sebastian?

384
00:31:33,418 --> 00:31:34,668
Yes, Pinocchio?

385
00:31:36,959 --> 00:31:38,084
Who's Carlo?

386
00:31:40,584 --> 00:31:41,959
Carlo was a boy.

387
00:31:42,918 --> 00:31:45,084
Geppetto lost him many years ago.

388
00:31:45,668 --> 00:31:50,543
Where did he put him?
How can you lose a whole person?

389
00:31:50,626 --> 00:31:53,959
I mean, he… he died, Pinocchio.

390
00:31:54,626 --> 00:31:55,959
He's no longer alive.

391
00:31:57,043 --> 00:31:58,418
Is that a bad thing?

392
00:31:58,918 --> 00:32:03,084
Yes. It's a great burden
for a father to lose a child so young.

393
00:32:05,084 --> 00:32:06,501
What's a burden?

394
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:12,084
It's something painful you must carry

395
00:32:13,418 --> 00:32:15,834
even though it hurts you very much.

396
00:32:25,709 --> 00:32:27,626
<i>I wrote a lot that night.</i>

397
00:32:27,709 --> 00:32:29,626
<i>I had so much to say.</i>

398
00:32:29,709 --> 00:32:32,084
<i>Not about my own life, for a change,</i>

399
00:32:32,834 --> 00:32:36,084
<i>but about imperfect fathers</i>
<i>and imperfect sons.</i>

400
00:32:36,168 --> 00:32:38,584
<i>And about loss and love.</i>

401
00:32:38,668 --> 00:32:39,709
Hmm.

402
00:32:39,793 --> 00:32:41,834
<i>And for that one evening,</i>
<i>at least,</i>

403
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:46,126
<i>we were, all of us, blissfully oblivious.</i>

404
00:32:46,834 --> 00:32:48,418
You were right, Papa!

405
00:32:48,501 --> 00:32:52,168
These legs are much, much, much,
<i>much</i> better than the old ones!

406
00:32:53,751 --> 00:32:58,126
Ha! Look at me! I can walk backwards. Hup!

407
00:32:58,209 --> 00:32:59,959
And… And jump forwards!

408
00:33:00,043 --> 00:33:00,876
Hup!

409
00:33:00,959 --> 00:33:03,668
-I couldn't do it before!
-Huh?

410
00:33:05,793 --> 00:33:11,001
Ooh, Papa! Can you see this?
He looks just like me.

411
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:16,751
What is that?

412
00:33:20,084 --> 00:33:22,543
Pinocchio! Come on.
Hurry up. Hurry up.

413
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:27,334
Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy!
I love these new legs, Papa.

414
00:33:28,209 --> 00:33:30,293
-Can we go to the carnival?
-Hmm.

415
00:33:30,376 --> 00:33:32,626
Perhaps, Pinocchio. Perhaps.

416
00:33:33,501 --> 00:33:35,876
Right now we have work to do.

417
00:33:35,959 --> 00:33:38,751
-Work? I love work!
-Hmm.

418
00:33:38,834 --> 00:33:40,793
Papa, what is work?

419
00:33:40,876 --> 00:33:45,043
Oh, Pinocchio, please.
No more questions.

420
00:33:45,126 --> 00:33:46,126
Huh.

421
00:34:00,334 --> 00:34:02,418
-Stupid monkey!

422
00:34:03,918 --> 00:34:05,168
-Whoa!

423
00:34:23,501 --> 00:34:24,834
I'm coming!

424
00:34:26,834 --> 00:34:29,834
What is it? What are you doing here?

425
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:31,459
Ah!

426
00:34:31,543 --> 00:34:34,168
I told you to put up posters
and draw big crowds.

427
00:34:34,251 --> 00:34:36,793
This carnival is going to pot! And you?!

428
00:34:36,876 --> 00:34:40,501
Can you not see
how desperate the situation is?

429
00:34:45,126 --> 00:34:45,959
A what?

430
00:34:48,584 --> 00:34:52,251
A living puppet? Are you absolutely sure?

431
00:34:56,126 --> 00:34:58,376
This could get us to the top again!

432
00:34:59,293 --> 00:35:02,626
This could make us kings again!

433
00:35:36,418 --> 00:35:40,001
-Hey!

434
00:36:15,168 --> 00:36:17,668
-Now let it down.

435
00:36:19,334 --> 00:36:21,876
More. That's it. That's it.

436
00:36:21,959 --> 00:36:24,334
Just a little more. Stop.

437
00:36:26,876 --> 00:36:27,959
There we go.

438
00:36:31,918 --> 00:36:34,709
Very good, child. Very good.

439
00:36:35,251 --> 00:36:38,501
Papa, there's something
I don't understand.

440
00:36:38,584 --> 00:36:40,168
What is it, Pinocchio?

441
00:36:40,959 --> 00:36:42,543
Everybody likes <i>him</i>.

442
00:36:43,168 --> 00:36:44,168
Who?

443
00:36:44,251 --> 00:36:45,084
Him.

444
00:36:45,709 --> 00:36:47,709
-Huh?
-They were all singing to him.

445
00:36:48,709 --> 00:36:50,418
He's made of wood too.

446
00:36:50,501 --> 00:36:52,751
Why do they like <i>him</i> and not me?

447
00:36:55,459 --> 00:36:57,209
Come here, Pinocchio.

448
00:37:01,126 --> 00:37:05,501
People are sometimes
afraid of things they don't know,

449
00:37:05,584 --> 00:37:12,168
but they'll get to know you
and like you, and for that, uh…

450
00:37:13,918 --> 00:37:15,334
Are you ready for school?

451
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:20,334
Then I have something
I'd like to give you.

452
00:37:21,293 --> 00:37:22,501
Ta-da!

453
00:37:24,584 --> 00:37:26,084
I love it, Papa!

454
00:37:26,834 --> 00:37:28,584
I love it! I love it! I love it!

455
00:37:32,168 --> 00:37:33,084
What is it?

456
00:37:35,418 --> 00:37:36,751
It is a schoolbook.

457
00:37:37,501 --> 00:37:40,418
A very special schoolbook.

458
00:37:40,918 --> 00:37:44,501
One which belonged to a very special boy.

459
00:37:45,126 --> 00:37:48,334
Carlo, the boy you lost?

460
00:37:48,418 --> 00:37:49,376
Uh-huh.

461
00:37:49,876 --> 00:37:51,668
Was he a very good boy, Papa?

462
00:37:52,168 --> 00:37:53,209
Yes, he was.

463
00:37:56,293 --> 00:37:58,126
And you loved him very much?

464
00:37:58,793 --> 00:37:59,709
I did.

465
00:38:00,543 --> 00:38:02,459
I… I do.

466
00:38:04,959 --> 00:38:07,293
Then I will be just like Carlo!

467
00:38:07,376 --> 00:38:11,459
I will obey and go to school,
and I'll be the very, very best

468
00:38:11,543 --> 00:38:13,501
at… whatever they do there.

469
00:38:14,293 --> 00:38:15,543
I'll make you proud!

470
00:38:23,043 --> 00:38:24,876
Hup! Hup!

471
00:38:24,959 --> 00:38:26,251
Hup! Hup!

472
00:38:28,584 --> 00:38:29,876
He exists!

473
00:38:29,959 --> 00:38:34,043
Oh, this dream, this wonder exists!

474
00:38:34,126 --> 00:38:38,293
-You beautiful, brilliant baboon!

475
00:38:39,209 --> 00:38:40,168
I must have him.

476
00:38:40,918 --> 00:38:43,126
-Whoa!

477
00:38:46,501 --> 00:38:47,376
Hup!

478
00:38:47,459 --> 00:38:50,293
School! Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!

479
00:38:50,959 --> 00:38:54,918
-What do you learn in school, Mr. Cricket?
-You'll learn reading and writing.

480
00:38:55,001 --> 00:38:57,501
You learn the multiplication tables!

481
00:38:57,584 --> 00:39:00,376
What's the <i>mulplitication</i> tables?

482
00:39:00,459 --> 00:39:04,751
Well, say you have four carts,
each with, uh, 27 apples.

483
00:39:04,834 --> 00:39:09,043
I don't care what the table says.
I have no apples, and I refuse to lie!

484
00:39:09,126 --> 00:39:10,584
Oh, no. It's just math!

485
00:39:10,668 --> 00:39:14,626
So you multiply the four and the seven…
four past seven? And you get--

486
00:39:14,709 --> 00:39:16,209
I get confused.

487
00:39:16,293 --> 00:39:19,084
I don't think
I like school anymore, Sebastian.

488
00:39:19,168 --> 00:39:21,501
Ah! We have found him!

489
00:39:21,584 --> 00:39:24,334
Look, Spazzatura! Our miracle!

490
00:39:24,418 --> 00:39:26,418
-Our sensation!
-Hey, watch it!

491
00:39:26,501 --> 00:39:28,168
Our star!

492
00:39:28,751 --> 00:39:29,751
Who? Me?

493
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:31,334
Yes, <i>mon étoile</i>!

494
00:39:31,418 --> 00:39:34,668
I am Count Volpe! You have been chosen!

495
00:39:34,751 --> 00:39:38,501
Come partake in
the fun, fanciful, carefree carnival life

496
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:42,334
as the star of my puppet show!

497
00:39:42,418 --> 00:39:44,043
Don't listen to him, Pinocchio!

498
00:39:44,126 --> 00:39:46,834
You promised your papa
you would go to school!

499
00:39:46,918 --> 00:39:50,376
Oh, yeah.
I promised my papa I'd go to school.

500
00:39:50,459 --> 00:39:53,293
See? He gave me Carlo's book.

501
00:39:54,084 --> 00:39:56,834
Carlo's book? Yes! Yes!

502
00:39:56,918 --> 00:39:59,251
A classical, canonical work.

503
00:39:59,334 --> 00:40:01,709
I can see
you're intrinsically an intellectual!

504
00:40:01,793 --> 00:40:06,209
But then now, book learning cannot compare
to witnessing the wide world

505
00:40:06,293 --> 00:40:11,084
with one's own eyes
from atop the glorious stage.

506
00:40:11,168 --> 00:40:13,043
-Wow.

507
00:40:13,709 --> 00:40:17,626
You shall see all
of the nations of the earth for yourself

508
00:40:17,709 --> 00:40:20,376
as they bow at your feet.

509
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:22,459
My brand-new feet!

510
00:40:23,084 --> 00:40:25,001
No! No, wait!

511
00:40:25,084 --> 00:40:26,876
You have to go to school!

512
00:40:26,959 --> 00:40:29,959
Oh, can we do it tomorrow?

513
00:40:30,043 --> 00:40:32,418
Regretfully, no.

514
00:40:32,501 --> 00:40:34,168
For today's the only day

515
00:40:34,251 --> 00:40:37,668
that our cacophonous carnival
will visit your vicinity,

516
00:40:37,751 --> 00:40:41,168
but if you must go to school,
then you must go to school.

517
00:40:41,251 --> 00:40:43,293
Come, Spazzatura.

518
00:40:43,376 --> 00:40:44,959
We must find someone else

519
00:40:45,043 --> 00:40:48,584
to eat all our ice cream
and popcorn and hot chocolate.

520
00:40:48,668 --> 00:40:51,043
-Hot chocolate?
-Oh no.

521
00:40:51,126 --> 00:40:52,043
Yes, of course!

522
00:40:52,126 --> 00:40:55,584
All the hot chocolate you can drink
and all the games you can play.

523
00:40:55,668 --> 00:40:57,459
Oh boy, oh boy!

524
00:40:57,543 --> 00:41:01,668
Maybe it'll be okay
if I'm a little bit late for school?

525
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:04,959
Yeah, perfectly fine.
No one will even notice.

526
00:41:05,043 --> 00:41:07,293
Don't listen to him, Pinocchio!

527
00:41:07,376 --> 00:41:10,543
Ah, we have
one last detail to take care of.

528
00:41:11,251 --> 00:41:12,209
Whoa!

529
00:41:12,293 --> 00:41:15,418
Sign here, here, and here. Need a pen?

530
00:41:16,168 --> 00:41:19,001
-No, Pinocchio! Don't!

531
00:41:22,959 --> 00:41:24,084
Like this?

532
00:41:26,334 --> 00:41:30,626
Perfect! I will now make you
burn bright like a star!

533
00:41:30,709 --> 00:41:32,626
Follow me, my boy!

534
00:41:39,501 --> 00:41:40,793
Oh, the pain.

535
00:41:40,876 --> 00:41:43,334
Life is such hideous pain.

536
00:41:47,334 --> 00:41:50,709
Master Geppetto,
would you mind coming down?

537
00:41:59,501 --> 00:42:02,043
Oh, at last!

538
00:42:02,126 --> 00:42:05,251
Our savior is restored.

539
00:42:18,251 --> 00:42:20,834
Oh, I'm… I'm so sorry.

540
00:42:23,876 --> 00:42:26,918
Your boy didn't show up at school today.

541
00:42:28,168 --> 00:42:31,376
But he left this morning.
I… I sent him there.

542
00:42:31,459 --> 00:42:34,334
Obviously, the puppet
is quite a dissident.

543
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:36,918
An independent thinker, I'd say.

544
00:42:37,001 --> 00:42:40,043
-Uh, uh, uh, yes.
-You better look for him.

545
00:42:40,126 --> 00:42:44,668
I trust we will see
the wooden boy tomorrow at school.

546
00:42:46,043 --> 00:42:49,126
Tomorrow?
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

547
00:42:51,584 --> 00:42:52,876
Ah!

548
00:42:53,793 --> 00:42:56,251
Boy, the carnival sure is grand.

549
00:42:56,334 --> 00:42:59,251
How about some more popcorn?

550
00:42:59,876 --> 00:43:03,293
Oh, I couldn't eat
another bite, Mr. Diavolo.

551
00:43:06,043 --> 00:43:08,501
I better get going to school, I guess.

552
00:43:08,584 --> 00:43:11,751
-Stay a while, Pinocchio.

553
00:43:11,834 --> 00:43:15,376
I am sorry to keep you waiting,
my little puppet.

554
00:43:15,959 --> 00:43:19,126
I don't like being called a puppet.

555
00:43:19,209 --> 00:43:23,001
My boy. Puppets are <i>le meilleur qui soit!</i>

556
00:43:23,084 --> 00:43:25,376
The tops! Lift your arm.

557
00:43:25,459 --> 00:43:28,418
Puppets are well respected
in every station of life.

558
00:43:28,501 --> 00:43:30,918
But I thought it was best
to be a normal boy.

559
00:43:31,001 --> 00:43:34,668
Oh, no, no, no. People love puppets.

560
00:43:34,751 --> 00:43:37,876
Like Il Diavolo, Columbina, Punchinello.

561
00:43:37,959 --> 00:43:41,751
Of course, there's but one puppet
who is king of them all!

562
00:43:41,834 --> 00:43:44,168
Oh boy, I'd like to meet that guy.

563
00:43:44,251 --> 00:43:48,084
Pinocchio!

564
00:43:48,168 --> 00:43:49,959
Wait. That's me!

565
00:43:50,501 --> 00:43:53,668
That's right. You are a wonder! A miracle.

566
00:43:53,751 --> 00:43:55,209
They'll love you!

567
00:43:55,293 --> 00:43:56,126
Who?

568
00:43:56,209 --> 00:43:57,376
<i>Les Idiots!</i>

569
00:43:57,459 --> 00:43:59,626
The wonderful children of the world!

570
00:43:59,709 --> 00:44:03,168
Lift your leg. Everyone shall love you
and call your name.

571
00:44:03,251 --> 00:44:07,959
-Pinocchio! Pinocchio! Pinocchio!

572
00:44:08,043 --> 00:44:11,626
Pinocchio, the living puppet!

573
00:44:19,043 --> 00:44:21,793
Oh.

574
00:44:24,376 --> 00:44:25,876
A one and a two and…

575
00:44:32,918 --> 00:44:36,834
<i>
-Yeah!</i>

576
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:50,543
-Pinocchio! Pinocchio!

577
00:44:56,001 --> 00:44:57,584
Pinocchio!

578
00:45:00,209 --> 00:45:01,084
No.

579
00:45:01,959 --> 00:45:03,626
Carlo's book.

580
00:45:06,418 --> 00:45:07,251
What?

581
00:45:08,584 --> 00:45:10,251
Over there.

582
00:45:14,959 --> 00:45:19,418
That song. How could he know that song?

583
00:45:23,209 --> 00:45:25,959
One nightmare after another.

584
00:45:39,251 --> 00:45:41,293
Yay! Pinocchio!

585
00:45:41,376 --> 00:45:42,293
Thank you!

586
00:45:42,376 --> 00:45:45,376
And all those treats are
for sale at the carnival.

587
00:45:45,459 --> 00:45:46,293
Thank you!

588
00:45:46,376 --> 00:45:49,126
Pinocchio? What's all this?

589
00:45:50,251 --> 00:45:51,334
What are you doing?

590
00:45:51,418 --> 00:45:52,584
Papa!

591
00:45:52,668 --> 00:45:55,834
I'm a star, Papa! A star!

592
00:45:55,918 --> 00:45:58,168
-They love me! They accept me!
-Oh, what are you--

593
00:45:58,251 --> 00:46:02,376
Enough of this nonsense.
You were supposed to be at school.

594
00:46:03,543 --> 00:46:06,293
And how do you know that song anyway?

595
00:46:07,834 --> 00:46:09,959
You simian simpleton!

596
00:46:11,626 --> 00:46:12,876
-My star!

597
00:46:12,959 --> 00:46:15,626
Where is my star?

598
00:46:16,334 --> 00:46:18,543
-Thank you. Thank you.

599
00:46:18,626 --> 00:46:20,001
Oh, you're very kind.

600
00:46:20,084 --> 00:46:25,959
You ruined Carlo's book,
and you didn't go to school! Why?

601
00:46:26,043 --> 00:46:29,501
You promised me
you would behave like… like… like--

602
00:46:29,584 --> 00:46:30,584
Carlo.

603
00:46:32,876 --> 00:46:33,959
Yes.

604
00:46:34,043 --> 00:46:36,293
I was going to, Papa, but… but…

605
00:46:37,001 --> 00:46:38,918
Yes, Pinocchio. What?

606
00:46:39,626 --> 00:46:42,043
Ten bandits came out
of the bushes and took--

607
00:46:43,584 --> 00:46:46,918
…out of the bushes,
and they took the book.

608
00:46:47,001 --> 00:46:48,793
Oh, I… I see.

609
00:46:48,876 --> 00:46:51,168
And then what happened?

610
00:46:51,251 --> 00:46:54,043
They had an axe,
and they wanted chocolate.

611
00:46:54,126 --> 00:46:55,293
Hot chocolate!

612
00:46:55,376 --> 00:46:58,751
Pinocchio, you shouldn't lie to me.

613
00:46:58,834 --> 00:47:00,209
I am your papa!

614
00:47:00,293 --> 00:47:02,751
-But I'm telling the truth!

615
00:47:03,251 --> 00:47:05,501
Then why is your nose growing?

616
00:47:05,584 --> 00:47:07,709
-It's not!

617
00:47:07,793 --> 00:47:10,834
Lies, lies, and more lies!

618
00:47:10,918 --> 00:47:13,501
I am not lying!

619
00:47:15,543 --> 00:47:17,168
Will you look at you?

620
00:47:22,626 --> 00:47:23,668
Go away!

621
00:47:23,751 --> 00:47:25,626
This is not a spectacle!

622
00:47:26,668 --> 00:47:28,209
But it is!

623
00:47:28,293 --> 00:47:30,793
Unhand my <i>carissimo</i>, you carousing…

624
00:47:32,668 --> 00:47:34,126
kleptomaniac!

625
00:47:34,209 --> 00:47:35,834
Do not touch him!

626
00:47:36,876 --> 00:47:38,084
I made him!

627
00:47:38,168 --> 00:47:39,793
And I discovered him!

628
00:47:39,876 --> 00:47:43,543
-He's not your puppet. He's mine!
-Oh!

629
00:47:43,626 --> 00:47:45,001
Perhaps we should--

630
00:47:45,084 --> 00:47:46,543
Oh, he is neither!

631
00:47:46,626 --> 00:47:50,626
-He's an actor. My actor.

632
00:47:51,334 --> 00:47:52,376
Give him to me!

633
00:47:52,459 --> 00:47:54,251
Never!

634
00:47:56,084 --> 00:47:57,959
-Oh dear.

635
00:48:00,251 --> 00:48:02,959
That was so much fun, Papa!

636
00:48:03,043 --> 00:48:04,168
-No!

637
00:48:11,084 --> 00:48:13,043
No…

638
00:48:17,376 --> 00:48:18,376
Pinocchio.

639
00:48:18,459 --> 00:48:20,293
He came out of nowhere!

640
00:48:20,376 --> 00:48:22,668
That's what happens
when you let your children run wild!

641
00:48:22,751 --> 00:48:24,168
<i>Pinocchio was dead.</i>

642
00:48:24,251 --> 00:48:27,251
<i>That much was apparent</i>
<i>to any astute observer.</i>

643
00:48:28,459 --> 00:48:32,126
<i>But little did I know</i>
<i>that death was not the end.</i>

644
00:48:45,001 --> 00:48:46,959
-Did you hear that?
-Who's there?

645
00:48:47,043 --> 00:48:51,001
-I thought he was dead.
-He is dead. I saw the paperwork myself.

646
00:48:51,084 --> 00:48:53,459
-Hello?

647
00:49:03,293 --> 00:49:05,459
All right. So, where were we?

648
00:49:05,543 --> 00:49:06,418
Whose deal?

649
00:49:06,501 --> 00:49:07,334
Mine, right?

650
00:49:07,834 --> 00:49:09,584
All right, boys, ante up.

651
00:49:09,668 --> 00:49:12,709
-What's the limit again?
-Twenty's the limit, ya mook.

652
00:49:12,793 --> 00:49:14,626
You got something under there, don't ya?

653
00:49:14,709 --> 00:49:17,501
Probably has a <i>leibedik</i> six.

654
00:49:17,584 --> 00:49:20,334
-Very funny.
-Are you playing a game?

655
00:49:21,126 --> 00:49:25,876
-Flush!
-I wanna play! Please, please, can I play?

656
00:49:25,959 --> 00:49:28,751
What part of dead
don't you understand, <i>schmendrick</i>?

657
00:49:28,834 --> 00:49:32,334
-It's boring in there. I hate being dead.

658
00:49:32,418 --> 00:49:34,334
Uh-oh, now you did it.

659
00:49:34,418 --> 00:49:35,293
What's that?

660
00:49:35,376 --> 00:49:36,793
Processing.

661
00:49:36,876 --> 00:49:39,001
Go see the boss, kid.

662
00:49:39,584 --> 00:49:40,959
Through there.

663
00:49:41,043 --> 00:49:43,126
-You'll see her.

664
00:49:43,626 --> 00:49:48,168
-Give me a freakin' ace, please.

665
00:50:02,459 --> 00:50:05,459
Hello? Hello?

666
00:50:09,001 --> 00:50:10,334
Who are you?

667
00:50:11,209 --> 00:50:14,126
I feel as though you've been here before.

668
00:50:14,209 --> 00:50:16,834
I am Pinocchio. I'm a boy.

669
00:50:16,918 --> 00:50:19,876
And I think I'm… dead.

670
00:50:19,959 --> 00:50:22,918
Ah, yes. I see.

671
00:50:24,376 --> 00:50:28,751
The wooden boy with the borrowed soul.

672
00:50:29,501 --> 00:50:31,334
My sister's folly.

673
00:50:31,418 --> 00:50:33,793
The sentimental fool.

674
00:50:34,584 --> 00:50:39,918
She gave you life, Pinocchio,
when you were not supposed to have it.

675
00:50:40,001 --> 00:50:43,418
No more than a chair or a table should.

676
00:50:44,209 --> 00:50:48,959
As a result, you cannot truly, truly die.

677
00:50:49,793 --> 00:50:51,168
Oh boy, oh boy!

678
00:50:51,251 --> 00:50:53,001
And… And that's good, right?

679
00:50:53,084 --> 00:50:55,209
Well, it means that you are not,

680
00:50:55,293 --> 00:50:59,668
nor will you ever be,
a real boy like Carlo.

681
00:51:01,418 --> 00:51:05,376
The one thing that makes human life
precious and meaningful, you see,

682
00:51:06,251 --> 00:51:07,918
is how brief it is.

683
00:51:08,876 --> 00:51:09,709
Oh.

684
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:14,501
Don't get me wrong, you will die

685
00:51:14,584 --> 00:51:17,209
many, many times.

686
00:51:17,293 --> 00:51:19,168
This being one of them.

687
00:51:21,543 --> 00:51:23,709
But they are not real deaths.

688
00:51:24,709 --> 00:51:27,043
Just waiting periods.

689
00:51:28,334 --> 00:51:30,209
There are rules, you see.

690
00:51:31,959 --> 00:51:35,209
Despite my sister's disregard for them.

691
00:51:36,668 --> 00:51:40,168
We will both have to wait
for the sand to run out.

692
00:51:41,376 --> 00:51:46,793
You will stay here with me
a little longer each time you cross

693
00:51:46,876 --> 00:51:49,084
until the end of time.

694
00:51:51,459 --> 00:51:54,168
And then, after that sand runs out?

695
00:51:54,876 --> 00:51:58,084
I will simply send you back
every time.

696
00:51:58,668 --> 00:51:59,959
I see.

697
00:52:00,459 --> 00:52:04,459
Well, in that case,
I'd like to ask you one thing.

698
00:52:07,584 --> 00:52:09,126
See you next time.

699
00:52:15,418 --> 00:52:16,251
No.

700
00:52:19,501 --> 00:52:20,334
No.

701
00:52:20,918 --> 00:52:22,668
Ah, Pinocchio.

702
00:52:24,376 --> 00:52:27,918
<i>Niente</i>. There's not much we can do.

703
00:52:28,001 --> 00:52:30,626
I'm afraid the body is rigid.

704
00:52:30,709 --> 00:52:33,876
Well, he's always been rigid.
He's made of wood.

705
00:52:33,959 --> 00:52:36,751
Even if he's dead, I could still book him.

706
00:52:36,834 --> 00:52:39,084
How dare you, sir!

707
00:52:39,168 --> 00:52:40,751
Show some respect.

708
00:52:41,334 --> 00:52:45,251
You show respect to me
and my projected quarterly earnings!

709
00:52:45,334 --> 00:52:46,709
Gentlemen, please.

710
00:52:46,793 --> 00:52:49,334
This is no time for your petty grievances.

711
00:52:52,126 --> 00:52:54,293
How do you intend
to dispose of the dead body?

712
00:52:54,376 --> 00:52:56,084
-A dead body? Where?

713
00:52:57,334 --> 00:52:59,626
Pinocchio! You're alive!

714
00:52:59,709 --> 00:53:00,834
He is immortal!

715
00:53:00,918 --> 00:53:02,834
Long live the arts!

716
00:53:02,918 --> 00:53:05,084
It's a miracle.

717
00:53:07,501 --> 00:53:09,334
Take it easy, my child.

718
00:53:10,126 --> 00:53:11,209
Lean on me.

719
00:53:11,293 --> 00:53:13,084
We're going home.

720
00:53:13,168 --> 00:53:16,001
-Uh, uh, uh. Wait a moment.

721
00:53:16,084 --> 00:53:17,876
I have a legally binding contract.

722
00:53:18,543 --> 00:53:22,251
Signed by both artist and management.

723
00:53:23,209 --> 00:53:28,376
He either performs,
or you owe me ten million lire!

724
00:53:29,001 --> 00:53:30,376
Well, that's ridiculous.

725
00:53:30,459 --> 00:53:32,251
It's just a smiling sun.

726
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:34,709
It's still his signature, is it not?

727
00:53:35,334 --> 00:53:36,418
I drew that.

728
00:53:36,501 --> 00:53:37,376
Ha ha!

729
00:53:37,876 --> 00:53:40,501
I demand full restitution before the law,

730
00:53:40,584 --> 00:53:44,293
including transportation,
transmutation, all the future represe--

731
00:53:44,376 --> 00:53:46,459
Our country comes first.

732
00:53:46,543 --> 00:53:48,251
This boy cannot be killed.

733
00:53:48,751 --> 00:53:50,334
-He's the ideal soldier.
-Hmm?

734
00:53:50,418 --> 00:53:53,376
He must be drafted
into the youth camps by law.

735
00:53:54,168 --> 00:53:55,918
You will learn to fight,

736
00:53:56,001 --> 00:53:59,126
and fire a weapon,
and be a real Italian boy.

737
00:53:59,209 --> 00:54:01,543
Now we… we must go.

738
00:54:01,626 --> 00:54:03,584
We truly must go.

739
00:54:03,668 --> 00:54:07,293
We will all speak later, I am sure.

740
00:54:07,376 --> 00:54:10,709
Not to me, sir. Speak to my lawyers!

741
00:54:12,001 --> 00:54:16,209
What… What a day. What a day!

742
00:54:16,293 --> 00:54:17,418
A fun day!

743
00:54:17,918 --> 00:54:19,501
What will we do?

744
00:54:19,584 --> 00:54:20,918
Oh, don't worry, Papa.

745
00:54:21,001 --> 00:54:23,376
I'll go to war. It sounds quite fun.

746
00:54:23,459 --> 00:54:27,209
I can learn to fight
and fire a weapon and march like the--

747
00:54:27,293 --> 00:54:28,793
No, Pinocchio.

748
00:54:28,876 --> 00:54:31,751
War is not fun!

749
00:54:31,834 --> 00:54:34,126
War is not good. War…

750
00:54:35,543 --> 00:54:38,793
War took Carlo away from me.

751
00:54:39,459 --> 00:54:40,751
Then I simply won't go.

752
00:54:40,834 --> 00:54:43,626
But you have to go now. It's the law.

753
00:54:43,709 --> 00:54:45,501
Even when it's something bad?

754
00:54:45,584 --> 00:54:50,584
Yes, we all have to obey the law
whether we like it or not.

755
00:54:51,084 --> 00:54:51,918
Why?

756
00:54:52,793 --> 00:54:57,459
I don't have time or patience enough
to explain that to you. I… I…

757
00:54:58,251 --> 00:55:00,834
I owe that man a fortune.

758
00:55:00,918 --> 00:55:07,251
And you… you will be taken far away
and recruited into military youth camp.

759
00:55:07,334 --> 00:55:11,001
And now… now look
what you've turned me into.

760
00:55:11,959 --> 00:55:14,876
I made you to be like Carlo.

761
00:55:14,959 --> 00:55:17,459
Why can't you be more like Carlo?

762
00:55:17,543 --> 00:55:19,293
Because I'm not Carlo.

763
00:55:19,376 --> 00:55:21,334
I don't wanna be like Carlo.

764
00:55:21,418 --> 00:55:22,876
-Carlo is--
-Enough!

765
00:55:24,918 --> 00:55:28,209
You are such a burden.

766
00:55:35,126 --> 00:55:36,001
Oh.

767
00:55:53,293 --> 00:55:55,168
His nose didn't grow.

768
00:55:56,418 --> 00:55:57,709
What's that?

769
00:55:57,793 --> 00:56:01,376
When he called me a burden,
his nose didn't grow.

770
00:56:02,834 --> 00:56:04,459
That's how he really feels.

771
00:56:06,334 --> 00:56:08,043
I don't want to be a burden.

772
00:56:08,876 --> 00:56:12,376
I don't want to hurt Papa
and make him want to yell at me like that.

773
00:56:13,584 --> 00:56:14,668
Oh, Pinocchio.

774
00:56:15,918 --> 00:56:19,793
Sometimes fathers feel despair
like everybody else.

775
00:56:20,376 --> 00:56:21,709
And they say things,

776
00:56:22,376 --> 00:56:25,209
things they only think they mean
in the moment.

777
00:56:25,876 --> 00:56:27,918
But with time, they learn that…

778
00:56:29,376 --> 00:56:31,668
well, that they
never really meant it at all.

779
00:56:33,209 --> 00:56:34,293
Do you understand?

780
00:56:39,709 --> 00:56:42,834
Hey. Hey, where are you going?

781
00:56:42,918 --> 00:56:44,584
I've got a plan.

782
00:56:44,668 --> 00:56:48,251
-Pinocchio, wha… what are you doing?
-You'll see!

783
00:56:48,334 --> 00:56:50,001
I'm going to the carnival.

784
00:56:50,834 --> 00:56:54,209
That way, I can help Papa,
and I won't go to war.

785
00:56:54,834 --> 00:56:57,293
I'll leave him a note
explaining everything.

786
00:56:59,209 --> 00:57:01,168
No, Pinocchio, don't do this.

787
00:57:02,959 --> 00:57:04,251
Oh, that's--

788
00:57:05,251 --> 00:57:06,751
No! No!

789
00:57:06,834 --> 00:57:07,751
Hmm.

790
00:57:08,626 --> 00:57:10,418
No! No, don't do this!

791
00:57:11,126 --> 00:57:13,668
You tell him that I will send him money.

792
00:57:14,584 --> 00:57:16,126
And tell him I love him.

793
00:57:16,918 --> 00:57:19,001
And I won't be a burden anymore.

794
00:57:23,668 --> 00:57:25,709
No!

795
00:57:51,084 --> 00:57:53,251
-Huh?

796
00:57:53,959 --> 00:57:55,459
-What is it?

797
00:57:55,543 --> 00:57:57,293
What do you want in the middle of the…

798
00:57:57,376 --> 00:58:00,001
My beloved star!

799
00:58:01,293 --> 00:58:03,626
How can I be of assistance?

800
00:58:04,293 --> 00:58:08,084
If I work for you, will you forget
the money you want from my papa?

801
00:58:08,668 --> 00:58:10,084
Huh?

802
00:58:10,793 --> 00:58:13,584
Oh, absolutely, my dear boy.

803
00:58:14,168 --> 00:58:17,334
And will you send him
my share of the profits?

804
00:58:17,418 --> 00:58:19,959
Clear accounting all the way.

805
00:58:20,709 --> 00:58:23,084
Fifty-fifty, right down the middle.

806
00:58:29,293 --> 00:58:31,834
-Oh.

807
00:58:31,918 --> 00:58:34,793
-Everybody up!

808
00:58:37,168 --> 00:58:38,876
We're leaving!

809
00:59:07,876 --> 00:59:08,751
Oh.

810
00:59:10,459 --> 00:59:11,834
The pain.

811
00:59:16,626 --> 00:59:19,001
Pinocchio. Son.

812
00:59:20,001 --> 00:59:22,168
I just wanted to say…

813
00:59:26,293 --> 00:59:27,251
Pinocchio!

814
00:59:35,209 --> 00:59:36,251
Oh!

815
00:59:37,334 --> 00:59:38,584
Little cricket.

816
00:59:48,043 --> 00:59:50,376
He's gone! To the carnival!

817
00:59:52,293 --> 00:59:53,418
Pinocchio!

818
00:59:55,793 --> 00:59:57,001
Pinocchio!

819
00:59:58,626 --> 00:59:59,751
Pinocchio!

820
01:00:13,043 --> 01:00:14,126
Get! Get!

821
01:00:16,418 --> 01:00:17,334
Oh.

822
01:00:19,543 --> 01:00:21,168
How will I ever find him?

823
01:00:21,876 --> 01:00:24,418
Oh, now you want to find him?

824
01:00:25,376 --> 01:00:28,876
After all the things you said.
After you called him a burden!

825
01:00:28,959 --> 01:00:30,209
A burden?!

826
01:00:30,918 --> 01:00:32,334
Why are you so blind?

827
01:00:32,418 --> 01:00:34,543
So absolutely blind!

828
01:00:34,626 --> 01:00:35,959
The boy loves you.

829
01:00:37,334 --> 01:00:41,168
He has much to learn,
but he loves you for who you are.

830
01:00:41,251 --> 01:00:43,751
Would it kill you to do as much for him?

831
01:00:43,834 --> 01:00:47,043
You should start acting like a father.
A real father!

832
01:00:47,126 --> 01:00:51,459
Not an old stubborn goat who's so busy
moaning and crying about his losses…

833
01:00:51,543 --> 01:00:54,084
"Me, me, me, poor me!"

834
01:00:54,168 --> 01:00:57,334
…that he cannot see
the love he actually has!

835
01:00:57,418 --> 01:00:59,668
I may be a bug, sir,

836
01:00:59,751 --> 01:01:02,001
but I have a thing or two
to teach you about…

837
01:01:02,084 --> 01:01:04,334
Hey! Where are you going?

838
01:01:04,418 --> 01:01:06,251
After my son!

839
01:01:06,334 --> 01:01:09,459
Excuse… If I may,
per… perhaps we should… Wait!

840
01:01:14,084 --> 01:01:16,168
-Wait! Wait! Wait!

841
01:03:01,709 --> 01:03:02,834
Ah!

842
01:04:38,084 --> 01:04:41,251
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

843
01:04:43,126 --> 01:04:46,293
<i>Viva Benito Mussolini, nostro duce!</i>

844
01:04:47,293 --> 01:04:50,918
<i>Viva! Viva! Viva!</i>

845
01:05:08,043 --> 01:05:10,668
Just one last stop.

846
01:05:10,751 --> 01:05:14,418
Don't forget to send
my share of the money back home to Papa.

847
01:05:14,501 --> 01:05:16,793
Oh, I wouldn't dream of forgetting.

848
01:05:16,876 --> 01:05:19,168
See? Fifty-fifty…

849
01:05:20,668 --> 01:05:24,376
minus expenses,
transportation, and promotion.

850
01:05:25,168 --> 01:05:26,459
Huh?

851
01:05:26,543 --> 01:05:31,418
Tomorrow we go
to a small town by the sea. Catania.

852
01:05:33,001 --> 01:05:38,459
And there we will perform
for his excellency, <i>Il Duce.</i>

853
01:05:38,543 --> 01:05:40,126
<i>Il Dolce?</i>

854
01:05:40,209 --> 01:05:41,793
No, my brightest star.

855
01:05:41,876 --> 01:05:47,501
Our fearless leader,
<i>Il Duce</i>, Benito Mussolini!

856
01:05:48,126 --> 01:05:52,584
He heard of our act
and is coming to see us! Oh!

857
01:05:54,709 --> 01:05:56,918
He and I are very close.

858
01:05:58,334 --> 01:06:00,334
Here we are in Roma.

859
01:06:01,459 --> 01:06:02,918
That's him, back there.

860
01:06:03,959 --> 01:06:08,584
You will make me and your papa so proud.

861
01:06:08,668 --> 01:06:09,709
Proud.

862
01:06:13,918 --> 01:06:15,168
Excuse me, sir.

863
01:06:16,001 --> 01:06:19,376
Catania. Do you go there?

864
01:06:19,459 --> 01:06:21,418
Can… Can you take me there?

865
01:06:21,501 --> 01:06:22,668
Please?

866
01:06:22,751 --> 01:06:24,918
It's just across the strait.

867
01:06:26,251 --> 01:06:28,168
That's not the sea out there.

868
01:06:34,668 --> 01:06:36,793
-It's a graveyard!

869
01:06:36,876 --> 01:06:38,293
Oh dear… Oh…

870
01:06:38,376 --> 01:06:42,376
The dogfish, risen from the icy depths

871
01:06:42,459 --> 01:06:45,709
to take its tribute in blood and steel.

872
01:06:46,209 --> 01:06:50,209
A monster the size o' 20 ships,

873
01:06:50,293 --> 01:06:54,209
full of hunger and rage.

874
01:06:54,293 --> 01:06:57,834
Oh please. That's just children's stories.

875
01:06:57,918 --> 01:06:58,876
Captain,

876
01:07:00,084 --> 01:07:04,001
my son is on the other side of the gulf.

877
01:07:04,918 --> 01:07:07,793
He is performing tomorrow.

878
01:07:10,834 --> 01:07:13,043
This is all I have in the world.

879
01:07:13,126 --> 01:07:14,626
Take it. It's yours.

880
01:07:14,709 --> 01:07:17,126
I just want to see him again.

881
01:07:21,709 --> 01:07:25,084
-Step and turn. And step and turn.

882
01:07:25,168 --> 01:07:27,251
And look alive and step.

883
01:07:27,334 --> 01:07:30,209
-Step. Step.
-Can I take a moment to rest?

884
01:07:30,293 --> 01:07:33,084
No. Your tempo
is getting sloppier and sloppier.

885
01:07:33,168 --> 01:07:35,001
-No rest whatsoever.

886
01:07:39,084 --> 01:07:40,793
Five minutes, please.

887
01:07:43,001 --> 01:07:44,209
Three minutes.

888
01:07:45,418 --> 01:07:47,043
-Ooh.

889
01:07:53,626 --> 01:07:56,334
Are you feeling okay, Pinocchio?

890
01:07:56,418 --> 01:07:57,418
We're concerned.

891
01:07:57,501 --> 01:07:59,751
You look so tired and worn out.

892
01:07:59,834 --> 01:08:01,668
You need a good long rest.

893
01:08:01,751 --> 01:08:06,251
And some trousers and another ear
wouldn't hurt either if you ask me.

894
01:08:06,334 --> 01:08:08,751
Why not go home
and visit your papa for a while?

895
01:08:08,834 --> 01:08:10,543
This is no place for you.

896
01:08:11,043 --> 01:08:13,084
I can't.

897
01:08:13,168 --> 01:08:17,001
I have to keep working
and working and sending money.

898
01:08:17,084 --> 01:08:17,918
Yeah…

899
01:08:18,001 --> 01:08:19,168
The truth is

900
01:08:19,668 --> 01:08:22,001
Count Volpe is using you.

901
01:08:23,418 --> 01:08:26,751
He hasn't sent a penny to your father.

902
01:08:26,834 --> 01:08:28,168
What?

903
01:08:28,251 --> 01:08:31,584
He keeps all the money for himself.

904
01:08:31,668 --> 01:08:33,168
He doesn't care about you.

905
01:08:33,251 --> 01:08:34,584
You're not his favorite.

906
01:08:34,668 --> 01:08:36,709
Spazzatura is his favorite.

907
01:08:36,793 --> 01:08:39,584
He's always been. He's a genius.

908
01:08:39,668 --> 01:08:42,293
No! Count Volpe wouldn't lie to me.

909
01:08:42,376 --> 01:08:43,918
I'm… I'm his star!

910
01:08:44,959 --> 01:08:46,793
You're… You're all just jealous!

911
01:08:50,668 --> 01:08:52,709
Ugh.

912
01:09:08,334 --> 01:09:11,126
You think we will find him, Sebastian?

913
01:09:11,959 --> 01:09:13,501
My Pinocchio?

914
01:09:14,376 --> 01:09:16,793
I do. You see…

915
01:09:29,751 --> 01:09:31,084
Arrivederci!

916
01:09:47,751 --> 01:09:49,584
Ha ha! It's me!

917
01:09:49,668 --> 01:09:51,501
-Look, here he comes!
It's him! It's him!

918
01:09:51,584 --> 01:09:55,418
-It's Pinocchio! Let me talk to him.
-Thank you. Oh, you're very kind.

919
01:09:55,501 --> 01:09:57,126
Not right now, I'm sorry.

920
01:09:59,376 --> 01:10:01,459
-You worthless…

921
01:10:01,543 --> 01:10:05,584
…mangy, deranged ape!

922
01:10:05,668 --> 01:10:06,668
Hmm?

923
01:10:08,209 --> 01:10:10,168
What have you been saying to him, huh?

924
01:10:10,251 --> 01:10:14,418
On the night before the big performance,
you could cost me everything!

925
01:10:14,959 --> 01:10:19,209
-You know who's coming? You have any idea?

926
01:10:19,293 --> 01:10:23,501
I found you
at the bottom of that cage in the rain.

927
01:10:23,584 --> 01:10:25,543
You were left there to die.

928
01:10:25,626 --> 01:10:28,459
Nobody wanted you, and I saved you.

929
01:10:28,543 --> 01:10:29,584
Rescued you!

930
01:10:30,084 --> 01:10:31,959
I should've let you die!

931
01:10:32,793 --> 01:10:34,709
Hey! Stop that!

932
01:10:34,793 --> 01:10:36,168
Don't hurt him anymore!

933
01:10:36,668 --> 01:10:41,251
This does not concern you, Pinocchio.
You're a star. Go rehearse your steps.

934
01:10:41,334 --> 01:10:42,959
I demand that you stop!

935
01:10:43,543 --> 01:10:45,959
You said it! I am the star of this show,

936
01:10:46,043 --> 01:10:48,584
and I won't have
my costar treated this way.

937
01:10:48,668 --> 01:10:52,126
And what's this I hear about
my papa not getting any money?

938
01:10:52,209 --> 01:10:54,876
I might just go home
right now and ask him.

939
01:10:54,959 --> 01:10:56,251
What do you think about that?

940
01:10:56,334 --> 01:10:59,251
You can perform for <i>Il Dolce</i> yourself.

941
01:11:01,793 --> 01:11:06,418
I think you misunderstand
our relationship, my little fire hazard.

942
01:11:07,126 --> 01:11:08,668
I am the puppeteer.

943
01:11:09,876 --> 01:11:11,668
-Uh!
-You are the puppet.

944
01:11:12,334 --> 01:11:14,459
I am the master.

945
01:11:14,543 --> 01:11:16,001
You are the slave!

946
01:11:16,084 --> 01:11:18,834
-And you will do as I command

947
01:11:18,918 --> 01:11:21,334
until your wooden body rots,

948
01:11:21,418 --> 01:11:23,793
and I use you to warm my furnace!

949
01:11:23,876 --> 01:11:25,459
-Oh.

950
01:11:25,543 --> 01:11:28,209
You may have no strings,

951
01:11:28,293 --> 01:11:30,418
but I control you.

952
01:11:30,501 --> 01:11:32,876
You obey me.

953
01:11:35,543 --> 01:11:36,626
Capisce?

954
01:11:37,793 --> 01:11:39,168
Spazzatura.

955
01:11:56,168 --> 01:11:59,334
A son knows when his father is alive.

956
01:11:59,959 --> 01:12:02,126
He will look for us, you'll see.

957
01:12:02,209 --> 01:12:04,543
-You have nothing to worry about.

958
01:12:04,626 --> 01:12:06,168
Easy for you to say.

959
01:12:09,376 --> 01:12:11,709
We are having dinner tonight.

960
01:12:14,043 --> 01:12:15,918
We're so lucky!

961
01:12:46,751 --> 01:12:49,626
Oh, Your Excellency!

962
01:12:49,709 --> 01:12:53,251
I wrote this number just for you.

963
01:12:54,209 --> 01:12:55,459
I like puppets.

964
01:12:58,793 --> 01:13:00,376
-Hey, Spazzatura.
-Hmm?

965
01:13:00,876 --> 01:13:04,418
You know, I think we ought to make
this big showstopper extra special

966
01:13:04,501 --> 01:13:07,251
for the all-important <i>Dolce</i> tonight.

967
01:13:07,334 --> 01:13:10,376
-Huh?
-I got some real good ideas.

968
01:13:11,168 --> 01:13:13,168
I think
that will definitely work.

969
01:13:16,209 --> 01:13:19,209
<i>In bocca al lupo, </i>my puppet.

970
01:13:19,293 --> 01:13:23,626
Delight the <i>Duce,</i>
and I will shower you with glory.

971
01:13:23,709 --> 01:13:27,668
Oh, we'll give him
a show he will never forget.

972
01:13:46,251 --> 01:13:48,751
-Poop?

973
01:13:48,834 --> 01:13:50,459
Yes. Poop, Your Excellency.

974
01:13:58,293 --> 01:14:02,001
-Poop! Poop! Poop! Poop!
-Ah!

975
01:14:20,959 --> 01:14:22,876
These puppets, I do not like.

976
01:14:23,709 --> 01:14:24,626
Shoot him!

977
01:14:26,584 --> 01:14:28,126
And burn it all down.

978
01:14:33,376 --> 01:14:35,043
Oh, hi! It's me!

979
01:14:35,126 --> 01:14:37,043
Ugh, it's him again.

980
01:14:37,126 --> 01:14:38,293
I cannot die!

981
01:14:38,376 --> 01:14:39,793
We know.

982
01:14:39,876 --> 01:14:42,043
-I can't die.

983
01:14:42,626 --> 01:14:44,126
I can't die!

984
01:14:44,918 --> 01:14:47,001
Through the door.

985
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:50,334
Can you believe it?

986
01:14:50,418 --> 01:14:53,584
I've escaped war, bullets, fire…

987
01:14:53,668 --> 01:14:54,876
I was run over!

988
01:14:54,959 --> 01:14:57,584
I could get killed a lot!

989
01:14:57,668 --> 01:15:00,168
I'm the luckiest boy in the world.

990
01:15:00,251 --> 01:15:04,376
As I see it,
you were charged with a terrible burden.

991
01:15:04,459 --> 01:15:06,251
Huh? A burden?

992
01:15:06,959 --> 01:15:08,334
No, I'm not.

993
01:15:09,418 --> 01:15:12,126
That's a horrible thing to say to a boy.

994
01:15:13,001 --> 01:15:15,709
Life can bring great suffering.

995
01:15:16,459 --> 01:15:20,168
And eternal life
can bring eternal suffering.

996
01:15:21,543 --> 01:15:23,876
Aw, it's not so bad as all that.

997
01:15:23,959 --> 01:15:26,543
Yeah, I get a little beat up every time,

998
01:15:26,626 --> 01:15:29,376
but as soon as I get back,
I'm going home to my papa.

999
01:15:29,459 --> 01:15:35,626
Ah, but, Pinocchio,
what if you don't see your father again?

1000
01:15:36,251 --> 01:15:37,334
Of course I will.

1001
01:15:38,209 --> 01:15:39,709
Why wouldn't I?

1002
01:15:39,793 --> 01:15:42,584
While you may have eternal life,

1003
01:15:43,084 --> 01:15:47,543
your friends,
your loved ones, they do not.

1004
01:15:48,126 --> 01:15:51,959
Every moment shared with them
may be the very last.

1005
01:15:52,876 --> 01:15:57,376
You never know how long
you have with someone until they're gone.

1006
01:15:57,459 --> 01:16:00,168
Huh? I… I don't understand.

1007
01:16:00,876 --> 01:16:03,043
Can… Can you tell me more?

1008
01:16:03,959 --> 01:16:07,918
Please? No! No! No!

1009
01:16:14,043 --> 01:16:15,084
Aha!

1010
01:16:16,334 --> 01:16:19,209
I knew it! You came back to life.

1011
01:16:21,543 --> 01:16:22,668
Hi, Candlewick.

1012
01:16:23,251 --> 01:16:27,501
Most of us, we have but one life
to give for our fatherland, but you…

1013
01:16:28,168 --> 01:16:30,168
you have no limit!

1014
01:16:31,793 --> 01:16:33,376
-Me?
-Yes!

1015
01:16:33,459 --> 01:16:34,376
You!

1016
01:16:35,209 --> 01:16:40,168
Follow my orders, learn to obey,
and you will be the perfect soldier.

1017
01:16:41,001 --> 01:16:42,793
But, my papa…

1018
01:16:42,876 --> 01:16:44,709
You'll return home a hero.

1019
01:16:44,793 --> 01:16:47,043
Any father would be proud of such a son.

1020
01:16:49,168 --> 01:16:51,168
-We're here.

1021
01:17:28,543 --> 01:17:29,918
Wow!

1022
01:17:30,001 --> 01:17:31,459
What's all this?

1023
01:17:31,543 --> 01:17:34,876
The Elite Military Project
for Special Patriotic Youth.

1024
01:17:34,959 --> 01:17:37,001
-What's an elite?
-We are.

1025
01:17:37,084 --> 01:17:39,918
We're gonna learn to be elite soldiers!

1026
01:17:40,001 --> 01:17:41,793
Learn? Like school?

1027
01:17:41,876 --> 01:17:46,584
To… To read and write
and do the <i>mulplitication</i> thingies?

1028
01:17:47,709 --> 01:17:49,543
You're funny.

1029
01:17:56,918 --> 01:17:57,918
Listen up.

1030
01:17:58,459 --> 01:18:01,543
They're reporting
hostile planes in the area.

1031
01:18:01,626 --> 01:18:06,334
But <i>we</i> will carry on
with the exercises tomorrow.

1032
01:18:07,918 --> 01:18:10,001
Anyone here afraid of the enemy?

1033
01:18:10,668 --> 01:18:12,626
-Uh-huh!
-No, sir!

1034
01:18:14,293 --> 01:18:15,334
Mm-mm.

1035
01:18:15,418 --> 01:18:16,668
Good.

1036
01:18:16,751 --> 01:18:20,251
You may be boys,
but you have the hearts of men.

1037
01:18:23,543 --> 01:18:27,001
Tomorrow, you train
for the glory of Italy!

1038
01:18:27,084 --> 01:18:30,793
Tomorrow, you will
make your fatherland proud.

1039
01:18:35,334 --> 01:18:37,209
Pinocchio. Pinocchio.

1040
01:18:37,709 --> 01:18:38,626
Yeah?

1041
01:18:39,209 --> 01:18:41,543
What do you think
my father meant about those planes?

1042
01:18:41,626 --> 01:18:43,084
I don't know.

1043
01:18:43,876 --> 01:18:47,043
I still don't really understand
what we're even doing here.

1044
01:18:48,334 --> 01:18:51,543
We're preparing to be soldiers. For war.

1045
01:18:51,626 --> 01:18:54,459
But my papa said war is bad.

1046
01:18:54,543 --> 01:18:56,293
That's 'cause he's a coward.

1047
01:18:56,376 --> 01:18:59,043
A coward? My papa?

1048
01:18:59,126 --> 01:19:01,126
Well, he's afraid of war, isn't he?

1049
01:19:01,209 --> 01:19:04,626
My father says if you're afraid to die
for your country, you're weak.

1050
01:19:04,709 --> 01:19:05,751
You're a coward.

1051
01:19:05,834 --> 01:19:07,251
Are you afraid?

1052
01:19:07,334 --> 01:19:08,418
I'm not afraid at all.

1053
01:19:08,501 --> 01:19:11,376
Well, neither am I. Or my papa.

1054
01:19:11,459 --> 01:19:13,418
-I love war.
-I love it more!

1055
01:19:13,501 --> 01:19:16,959
I love it twenty-four seven,
every day and anytime!

1056
01:19:17,043 --> 01:19:20,501
-So do I!
-Well, we'll see about that, won't we?

1057
01:19:25,084 --> 01:19:26,626
I'll show him I'm no coward.

1058
01:19:27,126 --> 01:19:28,376
I'll make him like me.

1059
01:19:30,543 --> 01:19:34,876
You know,
all fathers love their sons, but…

1060
01:19:36,334 --> 01:19:41,668
sometimes fathers feel despair,
like everyone else.

1061
01:19:41,751 --> 01:19:45,251
And they say things
they only think they mean in the moment.

1062
01:19:46,959 --> 01:19:51,543
But with time, they learn
they never really meant it at all.

1063
01:19:52,668 --> 01:19:58,834
And they may even call you ugly things
like a burden or a coward,

1064
01:19:59,418 --> 01:20:00,626
but inside…

1065
01:20:02,501 --> 01:20:03,751
they love you.

1066
01:20:08,126 --> 01:20:09,209
Are you scared?

1067
01:20:10,501 --> 01:20:11,543
Of dying?

1068
01:20:12,376 --> 01:20:14,709
Me? Nah.

1069
01:20:14,793 --> 01:20:16,293
I died a couple times.

1070
01:20:16,376 --> 01:20:17,376
It was all right.

1071
01:20:17,876 --> 01:20:22,709
There's rabbits and card games
and a lot of sand.

1072
01:20:23,334 --> 01:20:24,751
Blue sand.

1073
01:20:26,126 --> 01:20:27,376
You're so weird.

1074
01:20:27,459 --> 01:20:29,751
No weirder than you, pal!

1075
01:20:38,084 --> 01:20:40,209
I'm… I'm glad you're here.

1076
01:20:43,626 --> 01:20:44,626
Me too.

1077
01:20:49,043 --> 01:20:51,168
And as with all great empires,

1078
01:20:51,668 --> 01:20:54,668
the destiny of Italy will be forged

1079
01:20:54,751 --> 01:20:56,709
in the strength of its youth.

1080
01:20:57,834 --> 01:21:02,126
Today, you'll get your first taste of war.

1081
01:21:03,209 --> 01:21:04,834
You'll form two teams.

1082
01:21:05,834 --> 01:21:09,001
In the center of the battlefield
is a tower.

1083
01:21:09,709 --> 01:21:16,043
The first team to place their flag
at the top of the tower wins.

1084
01:21:16,543 --> 01:21:17,834
And remember,

1085
01:21:18,584 --> 01:21:21,126
no matter who is on the other team,

1086
01:21:21,209 --> 01:21:23,293
they are your enemy.

1087
01:21:25,376 --> 01:21:26,751
May the best man win

1088
01:21:26,834 --> 01:21:31,251
and bring glory to his team
and honor to us all.

1089
01:21:34,793 --> 01:21:36,793
Rifles are loaded with paint.

1090
01:21:37,751 --> 01:21:39,834
And the grenades, confetti.

1091
01:21:39,918 --> 01:21:41,918
-Mark your kill, boys.

1092
01:21:42,584 --> 01:21:44,084
-For Italia!

1093
01:21:44,168 --> 01:21:45,793
-Hey!

1094
01:21:45,876 --> 01:21:48,001
-Watch it!

1095
01:21:49,043 --> 01:21:50,293
W-- Wait!

1096
01:22:16,251 --> 01:22:18,501
Come on, boys! Let's go!

1097
01:22:24,168 --> 01:22:26,043
-Go! Go!
-Charge!

1098
01:22:29,043 --> 01:22:30,251
-Watch out!
-Oh!

1099
01:22:36,584 --> 01:22:38,376
Faster! Follow me!

1100
01:22:56,251 --> 01:22:57,209
Take this.

1101
01:24:00,959 --> 01:24:03,043
You're both here. Why?

1102
01:24:03,959 --> 01:24:06,293
We both won, Father!

1103
01:24:06,918 --> 01:24:09,293
Oh. Is that so?

1104
01:24:10,293 --> 01:24:13,626
And how did you come
to that conclusion, may I ask?

1105
01:24:13,709 --> 01:24:15,209
It was a tie.

1106
01:24:16,418 --> 01:24:18,209
We both climbed up fast.

1107
01:24:19,668 --> 01:24:20,834
Very good, then.

1108
01:24:22,584 --> 01:24:23,626
Candlewick…

1109
01:24:26,584 --> 01:24:27,626
…shoot the puppet.

1110
01:24:35,459 --> 01:24:36,959
But, Father…

1111
01:24:41,126 --> 01:24:43,418
this is a real gun.

1112
01:24:45,209 --> 01:24:46,959
Take your glory, son!

1113
01:24:47,043 --> 01:24:48,626
Shoot the puppet!

1114
01:24:50,293 --> 01:24:53,043
<i>Take your positions on the parapets.</i>

1115
01:24:54,376 --> 01:24:55,834
<i>Defend the center.</i>

1116
01:24:57,043 --> 01:24:58,834
<i>For Italy!</i>

1117
01:25:01,543 --> 01:25:03,168
We are under attack!

1118
01:25:03,251 --> 01:25:05,876
I told you to shoot the puppet!

1119
01:25:05,959 --> 01:25:08,501
No! I will not let you do this!

1120
01:25:12,501 --> 01:25:15,209
All my life, Father,
just trying to please you.

1121
01:25:16,668 --> 01:25:17,876
But I never will!

1122
01:25:18,584 --> 01:25:19,418
You were right.

1123
01:25:19,501 --> 01:25:23,834
I'm thin and weak and flimsy,
just like the wick of a candle.

1124
01:25:23,918 --> 01:25:24,918
Always afraid.

1125
01:25:25,418 --> 01:25:29,251
But even then, with all the fear I feel,
I can say no to you.

1126
01:25:29,793 --> 01:25:31,293
-I can do that.

1127
01:25:31,793 --> 01:25:34,793
I'm not afraid to say no. Are you?

1128
01:25:35,584 --> 01:25:37,168
You filthy coward!

1129
01:25:39,251 --> 01:25:41,084
Yes, you are weak!

1130
01:25:41,959 --> 01:25:44,584
You are no son of mine!

1131
01:25:46,168 --> 01:25:47,293
Candlewick!

1132
01:25:49,043 --> 01:25:49,918
Puppet!

1133
01:25:51,209 --> 01:25:52,501
On your feet.

1134
01:25:57,751 --> 01:25:59,501
Time for the final lesson.

1135
01:26:06,126 --> 01:26:07,043
Now,

1136
01:26:07,626 --> 01:26:11,001
you will know what it is
to truly serve the fatherland!

1137
01:26:11,834 --> 01:26:13,084
Ah!

1138
01:26:38,668 --> 01:26:42,084
Ah! Pinocchio! Pinocchio!

1139
01:26:55,751 --> 01:26:57,834
Hello, my little rebel.

1140
01:26:58,918 --> 01:27:01,126
I've found you at last.

1141
01:27:01,918 --> 01:27:03,584
I lost everything.

1142
01:27:04,501 --> 01:27:05,959
And now you will too.

1143
01:27:13,209 --> 01:27:15,626
-Huh?

1144
01:27:15,709 --> 01:27:17,168
Candlewick!

1145
01:27:17,251 --> 01:27:19,626
<i>Bonjour, mon étoile.</i>

1146
01:27:19,709 --> 01:27:22,334
No! Where's Candlewick?

1147
01:27:22,876 --> 01:27:26,168
Spazzatura! Please! Help me!

1148
01:27:27,959 --> 01:27:30,751
I'm all he has in this world,
the poor thing.

1149
01:27:30,834 --> 01:27:32,751
I have forgiven him.

1150
01:27:32,834 --> 01:27:36,459
-But you! You squandered everything!

1151
01:27:41,626 --> 01:27:43,626
Give me that torch, Spazzatura!

1152
01:27:45,001 --> 01:27:46,209
Spazzatura!

1153
01:27:47,376 --> 01:27:50,709
-Ah! Give me that, you mangy ape!

1154
01:27:50,793 --> 01:27:52,001
Let me go!

1155
01:27:53,334 --> 01:27:55,918
Is our contract worth nothing?

1156
01:27:56,459 --> 01:27:58,251
I'll do my part,

1157
01:27:58,334 --> 01:28:00,584
and you, you will burn.

1158
01:28:01,126 --> 01:28:02,209
Burn bright!

1159
01:28:02,709 --> 01:28:04,168
Like a star!

1160
01:28:06,459 --> 01:28:08,001
Hey, that's hot!

1161
01:28:08,084 --> 01:28:09,334
Worse than chocolate!

1162
01:28:09,418 --> 01:28:11,376
-Ow! Ow!

1163
01:28:11,459 --> 01:28:12,459
Help!

1164
01:28:13,918 --> 01:28:15,126
Please! Help!

1165
01:28:15,209 --> 01:28:17,668
-Help! Ow!

1166
01:28:17,751 --> 01:28:18,668
Help!

1167
01:28:19,751 --> 01:28:20,959
-Ah!

1168
01:28:26,918 --> 01:28:28,251
Whoa!

1169
01:28:29,251 --> 01:28:32,251
How could you do this to me?

1170
01:28:32,334 --> 01:28:33,793
And for a puppet?

1171
01:28:33,876 --> 01:28:37,334
You loathsome <i>lusus naturae</i>!

1172
01:28:40,209 --> 01:28:43,668
You will betray me no more!

1173
01:29:16,376 --> 01:29:18,251
Spazzatura!

1174
01:29:40,459 --> 01:29:41,751
Spazzatura.

1175
01:29:43,001 --> 01:29:45,084
Will I ever see my papa again?

1176
01:29:45,168 --> 01:29:47,459
-Huh?

1177
01:29:51,084 --> 01:29:51,918
Huh?

1178
01:29:59,834 --> 01:30:02,834
Look! An island!

1179
01:30:18,501 --> 01:30:22,293
-Swim!

1180
01:30:28,001 --> 01:30:28,918
Whoa!

1181
01:30:46,793 --> 01:30:47,751
Huh?

1182
01:30:54,334 --> 01:30:55,168
Huh?

1183
01:30:59,126 --> 01:31:00,084
Ugh.

1184
01:31:18,709 --> 01:31:21,501
Papa? Papa!

1185
01:31:33,209 --> 01:31:34,168
Papa!

1186
01:31:35,168 --> 01:31:37,084
-You're alive!

1187
01:31:40,293 --> 01:31:41,626
Pinocchio!

1188
01:31:42,959 --> 01:31:44,751
Oh.

1189
01:31:44,834 --> 01:31:46,876
-My Pinocchio.

1190
01:31:51,084 --> 01:31:52,126
Love hurts.

1191
01:32:01,834 --> 01:32:03,751
You'll be okay, Papa.

1192
01:32:03,834 --> 01:32:07,834
After you're feeling better,
we'll go right home. Okay?

1193
01:32:08,709 --> 01:32:10,334
No, Pinocchio, no.

1194
01:32:11,418 --> 01:32:14,168
There's no escape from this dreaded beast.

1195
01:32:15,126 --> 01:32:20,418
He comes seeking the warmth of the sun
every decade or so.

1196
01:32:21,793 --> 01:32:24,959
It will soon sink back to the depths

1197
01:32:25,043 --> 01:32:29,168
of the darkest, coldest ocean
where it dwells,

1198
01:32:29,251 --> 01:32:32,918
and it will drag us with him.

1199
01:32:33,543 --> 01:32:36,001
Oh my God! This is it!

1200
01:32:36,918 --> 01:32:39,334
-Follow me!

1201
01:32:40,084 --> 01:32:41,126
Follow you? Where?

1202
01:32:41,209 --> 01:32:44,209
Up to the lighthouse and freedom!

1203
01:32:58,043 --> 01:33:01,626
The blow holes!
We can climb out through them!

1204
01:33:01,709 --> 01:33:04,876
But we… we'll never reach it.
It's… It's too far!

1205
01:33:05,626 --> 01:33:06,959
Pinocchio can help!

1206
01:33:08,584 --> 01:33:09,668
Pinocchio, look.

1207
01:33:09,751 --> 01:33:11,918
Listen. Listen.
Okay, we have to climb…

1208
01:33:13,501 --> 01:33:15,334
What is it, Pinocchio?

1209
01:33:17,251 --> 01:33:19,209
Oh, Papa, I hate you!

1210
01:33:19,293 --> 01:33:21,126
What? Well, what do you--

1211
01:33:21,209 --> 01:33:25,793
And I hate you too, Spazzatura.
And you, Sebastian J. Cricket!

1212
01:33:27,626 --> 01:33:32,709
Yes, I see!
Just this once, lie, m'boy!

1213
01:33:32,793 --> 01:33:34,209
Yes, that's it! Lie!

1214
01:33:34,293 --> 01:33:36,209
My name is Panucchio!

1215
01:33:36,293 --> 01:33:37,543
More, Pinocchio!

1216
01:33:37,626 --> 01:33:39,626
I love the smell of onions!

1217
01:33:39,709 --> 01:33:41,376
I love… I love war!

1218
01:33:43,126 --> 01:33:46,126
I wanna be trapped here
forever and ever and ever!

1219
01:33:46,626 --> 01:33:48,209
That's it!

1220
01:33:49,834 --> 01:33:51,959
Climb now! Everybody, climb!

1221
01:33:52,043 --> 01:33:53,959
Hurry! Come on!

1222
01:33:56,668 --> 01:33:58,334
-What are you--

1223
01:33:58,418 --> 01:33:59,251
Oh.

1224
01:33:59,918 --> 01:34:02,459
Oh. Now steady on… Whoa!

1225
01:34:11,918 --> 01:34:14,751
Oh. Oh. Oh my word. Oh dear.

1226
01:34:18,459 --> 01:34:20,543
Whoa. Hold it. Whoa.

1227
01:34:29,459 --> 01:34:30,293
That's it!

1228
01:34:32,626 --> 01:34:35,418
Don't look down, Pinocchio!

1229
01:34:37,293 --> 01:34:38,334
Look at me!

1230
01:34:39,251 --> 01:34:40,834
-Look at your papa!

1231
01:34:40,918 --> 01:34:42,293
Ah!

1232
01:34:46,668 --> 01:34:48,251
He's going to sneeze! Hurry!

1233
01:35:00,876 --> 01:35:01,918
Ah!

1234
01:35:02,001 --> 01:35:03,793
No! No! Ah!

1235
01:35:03,876 --> 01:35:05,209
I've got you, son.

1236
01:35:08,001 --> 01:35:09,834
-Hold on, my boy!

1237
01:35:09,918 --> 01:35:12,251
-Ah!
-Help! Help!

1238
01:35:54,001 --> 01:35:55,251
Ah.

1239
01:36:07,209 --> 01:36:08,543
Uh-oh.

1240
01:36:08,626 --> 01:36:09,501
Whoa!

1241
01:36:18,168 --> 01:36:21,209
-Oh no! Pinocchio!

1242
01:36:36,043 --> 01:36:37,126
Papa!

1243
01:36:38,084 --> 01:36:39,751
Papa!

1244
01:36:46,918 --> 01:36:48,876
It's coming for us! Quick!

1245
01:37:02,001 --> 01:37:04,584
Come on, Spazzatura. You can do it!

1246
01:37:26,126 --> 01:37:27,168
Ah!

1247
01:37:27,251 --> 01:37:29,584
Ah! Ah! Ah!

1248
01:37:31,334 --> 01:37:33,293
Yes, faster, Spazzatura!

1249
01:37:33,876 --> 01:37:35,209
Hold on!

1250
01:37:42,501 --> 01:37:43,334
Ah!

1251
01:38:15,459 --> 01:38:17,918
No, not now!

1252
01:38:21,584 --> 01:38:24,251
Send me back now! Please!

1253
01:38:25,334 --> 01:38:27,959
I need to go back to save my papa.

1254
01:38:28,043 --> 01:38:30,001
You know the rules, Pinocchio.

1255
01:38:30,834 --> 01:38:34,584
All the sand must fall
before you can return.

1256
01:38:35,293 --> 01:38:37,918
There's no time! He's dying!

1257
01:38:38,001 --> 01:38:40,043
Rules are rules,

1258
01:38:40,126 --> 01:38:41,709
and if we break them,

1259
01:38:43,209 --> 01:38:45,626
there are dire consequences.

1260
01:38:46,209 --> 01:38:49,459
If you were to go back now, so soon,

1261
01:38:49,543 --> 01:38:51,251
you would become mortal.

1262
01:38:54,001 --> 01:38:55,543
You might save Geppetto,

1263
01:38:56,668 --> 01:38:58,834
but you will die, Pinocchio,

1264
01:38:59,709 --> 01:39:02,293
and it will be your last life.

1265
01:39:04,584 --> 01:39:06,251
I don't care!

1266
01:39:06,334 --> 01:39:07,501
Send me back!

1267
01:39:09,918 --> 01:39:10,834
Do it!

1268
01:39:11,376 --> 01:39:13,334
Not me, wooden boy.

1269
01:39:14,376 --> 01:39:17,293
Break the rules. Break them.

1270
01:39:18,334 --> 01:39:19,793
If you're sure.

1271
01:39:34,334 --> 01:39:37,126
Now, go to your father, child.

1272
01:39:39,501 --> 01:39:41,293
And make the most of it.

1273
01:40:26,084 --> 01:40:27,793
Ah!

1274
01:41:02,334 --> 01:41:04,543
We made it!

1275
01:41:05,751 --> 01:41:07,043
I can't believe it!

1276
01:41:07,959 --> 01:41:10,626
Ah.

1277
01:41:28,251 --> 01:41:29,418
Pinocchio.

1278
01:41:33,584 --> 01:41:36,043
My boy. My boy.

1279
01:41:39,376 --> 01:41:41,168
Wake up, Pinocchio.

1280
01:41:43,209 --> 01:41:44,418
Like last time!

1281
01:41:45,668 --> 01:41:46,501
Get up!

1282
01:41:48,251 --> 01:41:49,751
You're fine. You… You…

1283
01:41:57,459 --> 01:41:58,584
You are here.

1284
01:42:00,043 --> 01:42:01,084
My dear son.

1285
01:42:02,251 --> 01:42:03,334
Can't you see me?

1286
01:42:05,001 --> 01:42:06,584
You're… You're alive.

1287
01:42:07,668 --> 01:42:09,334
You're so free. I…

1288
01:42:11,209 --> 01:42:12,584
I need you.

1289
01:42:14,168 --> 01:42:16,459
Son.

1290
01:42:45,084 --> 01:42:46,418
Master Geppetto.

1291
01:42:50,668 --> 01:42:53,584
I only wished to bring you joy.

1292
01:42:55,459 --> 01:42:56,501
And you did.

1293
01:42:58,001 --> 01:42:59,584
You did bring me joy.

1294
01:43:00,376 --> 01:43:04,584
Such terrible, terrible joy.

1295
01:43:07,209 --> 01:43:10,334
Please, bring him back to me.

1296
01:43:11,793 --> 01:43:14,918
To save you,
he became a real boy.

1297
01:43:16,209 --> 01:43:19,459
And real boys don't come back.

1298
01:43:21,668 --> 01:43:22,793
I know that.

1299
01:43:24,626 --> 01:43:26,418
I know! But…

1300
01:43:29,001 --> 01:43:30,334
It's not fair!

1301
01:43:33,168 --> 01:43:35,876
In this world,
you get what you give, remember?

1302
01:43:35,959 --> 01:43:37,293
And this boy gave…

1303
01:43:38,001 --> 01:43:40,168
Well, he gave everything he could!

1304
01:43:42,501 --> 01:43:47,084
You said if I should perform my duties
and make Pinocchio a good boy,

1305
01:43:47,168 --> 01:43:50,668
guide him into doing what is right,
you would concede me one wish.

1306
01:43:52,209 --> 01:43:53,126
I did.

1307
01:43:54,001 --> 01:43:56,418
And did you accomplish this task?

1308
01:43:56,501 --> 01:43:59,668
Okay! Fine. So maybe I didn't do so great.

1309
01:43:59,751 --> 01:44:02,001
Maybe I messed up a little or… a lot,

1310
01:44:02,084 --> 01:44:06,959
but, well, I tried my best,
and that's the best anyone can do.

1311
01:44:07,043 --> 01:44:08,501
Pinocchio taught me that.

1312
01:44:09,168 --> 01:44:12,376
I mean, I taught it to him,
and then he taught it straight back at me.

1313
01:44:12,459 --> 01:44:13,876
And you know why? Because…

1314
01:44:15,418 --> 01:44:16,876
Because he was good.

1315
01:44:25,626 --> 01:44:28,251
Well, then, noble cricket,

1316
01:44:29,209 --> 01:44:30,793
choose wisely.

1317
01:44:32,209 --> 01:44:33,959
Well, gosh darn it!

1318
01:44:34,751 --> 01:44:36,376
I wish him back to life!

1319
01:44:38,334 --> 01:44:39,709
Very well, then.

1320
01:44:45,959 --> 01:44:48,668
Little wooden boy made of pine,

1321
01:44:49,543 --> 01:44:51,459
may you rise with the sun

1322
01:44:53,334 --> 01:44:55,209
and wander the earth.

1323
01:44:56,209 --> 01:44:57,418
Be his son.

1324
01:44:58,418 --> 01:45:00,751
Fill his days with light…

1325
01:45:09,668 --> 01:45:12,209
…so he'll never be alone.

1326
01:45:17,584 --> 01:45:18,793
Pinocchio.

1327
01:45:20,293 --> 01:45:21,959
My child.

1328
01:45:24,001 --> 01:45:27,543
I was trying
to make you someone you were not.

1329
01:45:28,501 --> 01:45:33,751
So don't be Carlo or anyone else.

1330
01:45:33,834 --> 01:45:36,418
Be exactly who you are.

1331
01:45:38,543 --> 01:45:39,376
I…

1332
01:45:40,834 --> 01:45:41,876
I love you

1333
01:45:43,168 --> 01:45:44,876
exactly as you are.

1334
01:45:52,459 --> 01:45:54,626
Then I will be Pinocchio.

1335
01:45:55,876 --> 01:45:57,709
And you will be my papa.

1336
01:45:58,293 --> 01:45:59,626
Will that do?

1337
01:46:01,126 --> 01:46:03,168
That will do.

1338
01:46:34,126 --> 01:46:35,293
Aw.

1339
01:46:35,376 --> 01:46:36,209
Oh.

1340
01:46:37,043 --> 01:46:39,209
Life is such a wonderful gift.

1341
01:46:55,168 --> 01:46:58,168
<i>And so it was</i>
<i>that we lived our lives.</i>

1342
01:47:02,418 --> 01:47:03,709
-Checkmate!

1343
01:47:05,668 --> 01:47:07,918
<i>We never saw</i>
<i>the wood sprite again.</i>

1344
01:47:12,501 --> 01:47:13,876
<i>Geppetto aged.</i>

1345
01:47:15,001 --> 01:47:16,334
<i>Pinocchio didn't.</i>

1346
01:47:19,126 --> 01:47:22,459
<i>And in time, Geppetto left.</i>

1347
01:47:30,543 --> 01:47:33,959
<i>One winter morning,</i>
<i>Pinocchio found me by the window.</i>

1348
01:47:35,001 --> 01:47:36,501
<i>I wasn't moving anymore.</i>

1349
01:47:37,084 --> 01:47:42,293
<i>So he put me in a matchbox,</i>
<i>and he carries me still with him.</i>

1350
01:47:45,209 --> 01:47:46,459
<i>Right in his heart.</i>

1351
01:48:15,918 --> 01:48:17,834
<i>He ventured into the world.</i>

1352
01:48:17,918 --> 01:48:21,459
<i>And the world,</i>
<i>I believe, embraced him back.</i>

1353
01:48:23,501 --> 01:48:25,543
<i>I've not heard of him in quite a while.</i>

1354
01:48:26,959 --> 01:48:28,418
<i>Will he eventually die?</i>

1355
01:48:29,709 --> 01:48:30,709
<i>I think so.</i>

1356
01:48:31,584 --> 01:48:33,668
<i>And maybe that makes him a real boy.</i>

1357
01:48:34,834 --> 01:48:37,251
<i>What happens, happens.</i>

1358
01:48:38,168 --> 01:48:41,043
<i>And then, we are gone.</i>

1359
01:49:03,168 --> 01:49:05,876
Are you gonna keep yappin',
or are you gonna play?

1360
01:49:05,959 --> 01:49:07,334
Do you mind?

1361
01:49:07,834 --> 01:49:09,751
I was recounting my life!

1362
01:49:09,834 --> 01:49:11,334
It was a good life!

1363
01:49:11,418 --> 01:49:13,126
Ah, good enough.

1364
01:49:15,668 --> 01:49:17,126
Hit it, boys!
