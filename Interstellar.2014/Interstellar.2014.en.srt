1
00:01:14,951 --> 00:01:17,137
Well, my dad was a farmer.

2
00:01:18,204 --> 00:01:20,765
Um, like everybody
else back then.

3
00:01:22,792 --> 00:01:25,061
Of course, he didn't
start that way.

4
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,045
Computer says you're too tight.

5
00:01:33,145 --> 00:01:35,989
- Nah, I got this.
- Crossing the Straights.

6
00:01:38,308 --> 00:01:40,160
- Shutting it down, Cooper.
- No!

7
00:01:41,561 --> 00:01:44,080
- Shutting it all down.
- No, I need power up!

8
00:01:48,318 --> 00:01:49,461
Dad?

9
00:01:55,909 --> 00:01:58,645
Sorry, Murph. Go back to bed.

10
00:01:58,745 --> 00:02:01,347
- I thought you were the ghost.
- No.

11
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:04,985
There are no such things
as ghosts, babe.

12
00:02:05,085 --> 00:02:07,353
Grandpa says you can get ghosts.

13
00:02:08,672 --> 00:02:13,626
Maybe that's because Grandpa's a little too
close to being one himself. Back to bed.

14
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,695
Were you dreaming
about the crash?

15
00:02:17,013 --> 00:02:19,407
Get your butt back in bed, Murph.
Heh.

16
00:02:46,334 --> 00:02:47,936
The wheat had died.

17
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:51,105
The blight came and
we had to burn it.

18
00:02:51,423 --> 00:02:54,701
And we still had corn.
We had acres of corn.

19
00:02:54,801 --> 00:02:57,153
But, uh... mostly we had dust.

20
00:02:59,472 --> 00:03:02,167
I guess I can't describe it.
It was just constant.

21
00:03:02,267 --> 00:03:06,246
Just that steady blow of dirt.

22
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:11,384
We wore, um...
little strips of sheet...

23
00:03:11,484 --> 00:03:14,262
sometimes over our
nose and mouth...

24
00:03:14,362 --> 00:03:16,965
so that we wouldn't breathe
so much of it.

25
00:03:18,575 --> 00:03:22,254
Well, when we set the table,
we always set the plate upside-down.

26
00:03:22,354 --> 00:03:25,598
Glasses or cups,
whatever it was upside-down.

27
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,039
Shake a leg! Murph,
get a move on!

28
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:36,868
Tom, 4:00 today, you and me in the barn,
Herbicide Resistance 101.

29
00:03:36,968 --> 00:03:38,570
- Check?
- Yes, sir.

30
00:03:40,013 --> 00:03:41,781
Not at the table, Murph.

31
00:03:42,432 --> 00:03:44,367
Dad, can you fix this?

32
00:03:45,852 --> 00:03:47,550
What the heck
did you do to my lander?

33
00:03:47,575 --> 00:03:48,575
Wasn't me.

34
00:03:48,588 --> 00:03:50,632
Let me guess.
It was your ghost?

35
00:03:50,732 --> 00:03:53,134
It knocked it off.
It keeps knocking books off.

36
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:55,114
- No such thing as ghosts, dumb-ass.
- Hey.

37
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:58,415
- I looked it up. It's called a poltergeist.
- Dad, tell her.

38
00:03:58,515 --> 00:04:00,600
Well, it's not very
scientific, Murph.

39
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,103
You said science was about admitting
what we don't know.

40
00:04:03,303 --> 00:04:07,140
- She's got you there.
- Hey. Start looking after our stuff.

41
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:09,976
Coop.

42
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:14,939
All right, Murph,
you want to talk science?

43
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:19,119
Don't tell me you're afraid of some ghost.
No, you got to go further.

44
00:04:19,219 --> 00:04:22,055
You got to record the facts, analyze,
get to the how and the why...

45
00:04:22,155 --> 00:04:25,575
then present your conclusions.
Deal?

46
00:04:26,142 --> 00:04:27,660
- Deal.
- All right.

47
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:32,665
- Have a good day at school.
- Hold up.

48
00:04:32,899 --> 00:04:37,387
Parent-teacher conferences. Parent.
Not grandparent.

49
00:04:39,572 --> 00:04:41,507
Slow down, turbo!

50
00:04:42,742 --> 00:04:46,037
- That's not a dust storm.
- Nelson's torching his whole crop.

51
00:04:46,137 --> 00:04:47,180
Blight?

52
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,099
They're saying
it's the last harvest for okra.

53
00:04:50,667 --> 00:04:51,935
Ever.

54
00:04:53,653 --> 00:04:56,448
He should've planted corn
like the rest of us.

55
00:04:56,548 --> 00:04:59,325
Now, be nice to that Miss Hanley.
She's single.

56
00:04:59,425 --> 00:05:00,994
What's that supposed to mean?

57
00:05:01,094 --> 00:05:04,289
Repopulating the earth.
Start pulling your weight, young man.

58
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:08,451
Why don't you start
minding your own business, old man?

59
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,418
All right, Murph,
give me second.

60
00:05:18,945 --> 00:05:20,254
Uh-huh.

61
00:05:20,738 --> 00:05:22,182
Third.

62
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:25,393
- Find a gear, dumb-ass.
- Grind it!

63
00:05:25,493 --> 00:05:26,636
Shut it, Tom!

64
00:05:27,912 --> 00:05:30,415
- What'd you do, Murph?
- Ah, she didn't do nothing.

65
00:05:30,515 --> 00:05:33,017
- Blew a tire is all.
- Murphy's Law.

66
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:34,751
Shut up!

67
00:05:34,832 --> 00:05:37,105
- Grab the spare, Tom.
- That is the spare.

68
00:05:39,632 --> 00:05:41,234
Get the patch kit!

69
00:05:42,427 --> 00:05:45,705
- How am I supposed to patch it out here?
- You got to figure it out.

70
00:05:45,805 --> 00:05:47,865
I'm not always gonna be here
to help you.

71
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,009
What's going on, Murph?

72
00:05:58,109 --> 00:06:01,387
Why did you and Mom name me
after something that's bad?

73
00:06:01,487 --> 00:06:04,841
- We didn't.
- Murphy's Law?

74
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,854
Murphy's Law doesn't mean
that something bad will happen.

75
00:06:09,954 --> 00:06:13,399
What it means is
whatever can happen will happen.

76
00:06:13,499 --> 00:06:16,144
And that sounded
just fine with us.

77
00:06:20,256 --> 00:06:21,899
Whoa!

78
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:23,776
Get in.

79
00:06:25,053 --> 00:06:26,571
Get in, let's go.

80
00:06:27,805 --> 00:06:30,033
What about the flat tire?

81
00:06:32,894 --> 00:06:34,328
Yeah.

82
00:06:48,201 --> 00:06:52,272
It's an Indian Air Force drone.
Solar cells could power an entire farm.

83
00:06:52,372 --> 00:06:53,931
Take the wheel, Tom.

84
00:06:59,295 --> 00:07:00,730
Go, go, go!

85
00:07:02,215 --> 00:07:03,983
Keep that aimed right at it.

86
00:07:12,008 --> 00:07:14,527
Faster, Tom. I'm losing it.

87
00:07:14,894 --> 00:07:16,037
Right at it.

88
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:18,981
Stay on it.

89
00:07:20,266 --> 00:07:21,550
Here we go.

90
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,379
Whoa.

91
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,095
Nice one, Tom.

92
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:39,936
Dad?

93
00:07:40,253 --> 00:07:43,106
I almost got it. Don't stop.
Don't stop!

94
00:07:43,464 --> 00:07:46,117
- Dad!
- Tom!

95
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:53,032
You told me to keep driving.

96
00:07:53,766 --> 00:07:58,329
Well, I guess that answers the old "If I
asked you to drive off a cliff" scenario.

97
00:08:01,441 --> 00:08:04,377
- We lost it.
- No, we didn't.

98
00:08:16,956 --> 00:08:18,724
Want to give it a whirl?

99
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,107
This way.

100
00:08:31,387 --> 00:08:32,572
Go.

101
00:08:33,473 --> 00:08:36,576
Let's lay her down right there
at the edge of the reservoir.

102
00:08:40,772 --> 00:08:42,582
Nicely done.

103
00:08:45,485 --> 00:08:47,428
How long you think it's been up there?

104
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:50,139
Delhi Mission Control
went down, same as ours...

105
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:52,175
- ...ten years ago.
- Heh.

106
00:08:52,408 --> 00:08:54,427
So for ten years?

107
00:08:57,288 --> 00:08:59,983
- Why did it come down so low?
- I don't know.

108
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:03,069
Maybe the sun cooked its brain
or it was looking for something.

109
00:09:03,169 --> 00:09:05,521
- What?
- Give me a large flatblade.

110
00:09:05,838 --> 00:09:08,608
Maybe some kind of signal?
I don't know.

111
00:09:13,863 --> 00:09:15,364
What are you gonna do with it?

112
00:09:16,182 --> 00:09:19,452
I'm gonna give it something
socially responsible to do...

113
00:09:20,228 --> 00:09:21,662
like drive a combine.

114
00:09:22,146 --> 00:09:23,748
Can't we just let it go?

115
00:09:25,942 --> 00:09:27,710
It wasn't hurting anybody.

116
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:33,674
This thing needs to learn how to adapt,
Murph... like the rest of us.

117
00:09:38,162 --> 00:09:40,274
How's this work?
You guys come with?

118
00:09:40,374 --> 00:09:43,876
I've got class.
This one needs to wait.

119
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:48,281
- What did you do?
- They'll tell you about it in there.

120
00:09:48,381 --> 00:09:50,616
- Am I gonna be mad?
- Not with me.

121
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:53,986
- Just please try not to.
- Hey. Relax.

122
00:09:55,304 --> 00:09:56,739
I got this.

123
00:10:01,093 --> 00:10:03,963
- Little late, Coop.
- Yeah, we had a flat.

124
00:10:04,063 --> 00:10:07,708
And I guess you had to stop off
at the Asian fighter plane store.

125
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:11,554
No, actually, sir,
that's a surveillance drone.

126
00:10:11,654 --> 00:10:14,507
With outstanding solar cells.
It's Indian.

127
00:10:14,824 --> 00:10:16,259
Take a seat.

128
00:10:17,285 --> 00:10:18,886
So, uh...

129
00:10:19,495 --> 00:10:22,181
we got Tom's scores back.

130
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:24,650
He's going to make
an excellent farmer.

131
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:28,321
Yeah, he's got a knack for it.
What about college?

132
00:10:28,421 --> 00:10:32,241
The university only takes a handful.
They don't have the resources to...

133
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:34,702
I still pay my taxes.

134
00:10:34,802 --> 00:10:36,904
Where's that money go?
There's no more armies.

135
00:10:37,305 --> 00:10:39,740
Well, it doesn't go
to the university.

136
00:10:40,424 --> 00:10:45,113
- Look, Coop, you have to be realistic.
- You're ruling my son out for college now?

137
00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:48,958
- The kid's 15.
- Tom's score simply isn't high enough.

138
00:10:49,859 --> 00:10:52,128
What's your waistline?
About what, 32?

139
00:10:52,445 --> 00:10:56,182
- About a 33 inseam?
- I'm not sure I see what you're getting at.

140
00:10:56,282 --> 00:11:00,803
It takes two numbers to measure your ass
but only one to measure my son's future?

141
00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:04,524
Come on.
You're a well-educated man, Coop.

142
00:11:04,624 --> 00:11:06,684
- And a trained pilot.
- And an engineer.

143
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:12,198
Okay, well, right now
we don't need more engineers.

144
00:11:12,298 --> 00:11:16,836
We didn't run out of television screens
and planes. We ran out of food.

145
00:11:16,969 --> 00:11:20,456
The world needs farmers.
Good farmers, like you.

146
00:11:20,556 --> 00:11:23,034
- And Tom.
- Uneducated farmers.

147
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:27,839
We're a caretaker generation, Coop.
And things are getting better.

148
00:11:27,939 --> 00:11:31,167
- Maybe your grandkids will get to be engin...
- Are we done here, sir?

149
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,544
No.

150
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:36,547
Miss Hanley's here
to talk about Murph.

151
00:11:36,781 --> 00:11:39,392
Murph is a great kid.
She's really bright.

152
00:11:39,492 --> 00:11:41,811
But she's been having
a little trouble lately.

153
00:11:41,911 --> 00:11:45,356
She brought this in to show the students.
The section on the lunar landings.

154
00:11:45,456 --> 00:11:50,486
Yeah, it's one of my old textbooks.
She always loved the pictures.

155
00:11:50,586 --> 00:11:54,365
It's an old federal textbook. We've
replaced them with the corrected versions.

156
00:11:54,465 --> 00:11:55,575
Corrected?

157
00:11:55,675 --> 00:12:00,104
Explaining how the Apollo missions
were faked to bankrupt the Soviet Union.

158
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:08,579
You don't believe we
went to the moon?

159
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:11,674
It was a brilliant
piece of propaganda.

160
00:12:11,774 --> 00:12:14,677
The Soviets bankrupted themselves
pouring resources...

161
00:12:14,777 --> 00:12:18,347
- into rockets and other useless machines.
- "Useless machines."

162
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:22,602
If we don't want a repeat of the excess and
wastefulness of the 20th century, then...

163
00:12:22,702 --> 00:12:26,597
we need to teach our kids about this
planet, not tales of leaving it.

164
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:31,435
One of those useless machines
they used to make was called an MRI.

165
00:12:31,711 --> 00:12:34,914
If we had any of those left,
the doctors would've been able to find...

166
00:12:35,014 --> 00:12:39,035
the cyst in my wife's brain
before she died instead of afterwards.

167
00:12:39,135 --> 00:12:42,288
Then she'd have been the one
listening to this instead of me...

168
00:12:42,388 --> 00:12:45,774
which would have been a good thing,
because she was always...

169
00:12:46,058 --> 00:12:47,660
the calmer one.

170
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:50,813
I'm sorry about your wife,
Mr. Cooper.

171
00:12:51,564 --> 00:12:55,301
But Murph got into a fistfight
with several of her classmates over this...

172
00:12:55,401 --> 00:12:59,764
Apollo nonsense. So we thought it best
to bring you in and see what ideas...

173
00:12:59,864 --> 00:13:02,633
you might have for dealing
with her behavior on the home front.

174
00:13:03,743 --> 00:13:06,854
Yeah, you know what?
Um, there's a game tomorrow night.

175
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:09,148
She's going through
a bit of a baseball phase.

176
00:13:09,248 --> 00:13:13,561
Her favorite team is playing.
There's gonna be candy and soda and...

177
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:18,482
I think I'll take her to that.

178
00:13:23,721 --> 00:13:25,272
How'd it go?

179
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:27,867
I got you suspended.

180
00:13:28,184 --> 00:13:29,618
- What?
- Cooper.

181
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,505
This is Cooper. Go.

182
00:13:32,605 --> 00:13:35,508
Coop, those combines you rebuilt
went haywire.

183
00:13:35,608 --> 00:13:37,877
Just reset the controllers.

184
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:40,838
I did that.
Now you should come take a look.

185
00:14:00,466 --> 00:14:03,636
One by one they've been peeling
off the fields and heading over.

186
00:14:03,736 --> 00:14:05,571
Something's interfering
with the compass.

187
00:14:06,972 --> 00:14:09,450
Magnetism or some such.

188
00:14:52,468 --> 00:14:56,956
Nothing special about which book.
I've been working on it, like you said.

189
00:14:57,606 --> 00:15:00,509
- I counted the spaces.
- Why?

190
00:15:02,153 --> 00:15:04,538
In case the ghost
is trying to communicate.

191
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,874
I'm trying Morse.

192
00:15:07,158 --> 00:15:08,642
Morse?

193
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:10,127
Yeah.

194
00:15:10,244 --> 00:15:12,938
- Dots and dashes, used...
- I know what Morse code is, Murph.

195
00:15:13,038 --> 00:15:16,258
I just don't think your bookshelf's
trying to talk to you.

196
00:15:27,553 --> 00:15:32,032
Had to reset every compass clock and GPS
to offset for the anomaly.

197
00:15:32,224 --> 00:15:34,868
- Which is?
- I don't know.

198
00:15:36,562 --> 00:15:38,756
If the house was built
on magnetic ore...

199
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:42,042
we'd have seen this the first time
we switched on the tractor.

200
00:15:44,612 --> 00:15:47,881
I hear your meeting at the school
didn't go so well.

201
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:50,217
Heh. You heard?

202
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:54,013
It's like we've forgotten
who we are, Donald.

203
00:15:55,581 --> 00:15:59,484
Explorers, pioneers,
not caretakers.

204
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:02,488
When I was a kid...

205
00:16:02,588 --> 00:16:06,817
it felt like they made something new
every day. Some...

206
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:10,487
gadget or idea.
Like every day was Christmas.

207
00:16:10,846 --> 00:16:16,035
But six billion people...
just try to imagine that.

208
00:16:16,936 --> 00:16:20,039
And every last one of them
trying to have it all.

209
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:25,736
This world isn't so bad.

210
00:16:27,488 --> 00:16:31,332
And Tom will do just fine.
You're the one who doesn't belong.

211
00:16:31,432 --> 00:16:34,445
Born 40 years too late,
or 40 years too early.

212
00:16:35,246 --> 00:16:38,048
My daughter knew it,
God bless her.

213
00:16:38,624 --> 00:16:41,518
And your kids know it.
Especially Murph.

214
00:16:41,752 --> 00:16:45,239
Well, we used to look up in the sky
and wonder...

215
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:48,016
at our place in the stars.

216
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:54,615
Now we just look down and worry
about our place in the dirt.

217
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:57,951
Cooper, you were
good at something...

218
00:16:58,185 --> 00:17:00,788
and you never got a chance
to do anything with it.

219
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,115
I'm sorry.

220
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:08,754
You didn't expect this dirt
that was giving you this food...

221
00:17:08,988 --> 00:17:12,174
to turn on you like that
and destroy you.

222
00:17:12,475 --> 00:17:16,804
In April... I believe I'm right...
Fifteenth of April, I think.

223
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:21,609
This happened about 1:30 when that thing...
came off the top of that canyon.

224
00:17:23,252 --> 00:17:27,573
In my day, we had real ballplayers.
Who are these bums?

225
00:17:27,673 --> 00:17:32,486
In my day, people were too busy
fighting over food to even play baseball.

226
00:17:32,678 --> 00:17:37,425
Popcorn at a ballgame is unnatural.
I want a hot dog.

227
00:17:37,525 --> 00:17:40,152
School says you're gonna follow
in my footsteps.

228
00:17:40,603 --> 00:17:42,204
I think that's great.

229
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:45,791
- You think that's great?
- You hate farming, Dad.

230
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:48,177
Grandpa said.

231
00:17:48,277 --> 00:17:49,795
Grandpa said, huh?

232
00:17:50,112 --> 00:17:52,723
Listen, all that matters
is how you feel about it.

233
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:54,591
I like what you do.

234
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,802
I like our farm.

235
00:17:57,369 --> 00:17:59,063
You're gonna be great at it.

236
00:18:12,042 --> 00:18:13,844
Let's get out of here.

237
00:18:20,601 --> 00:18:22,703
All right, it's a doozy.

238
00:18:23,312 --> 00:18:25,247
All right, gang, let's mask up.

239
00:18:28,484 --> 00:18:30,586
- Tom? Murph? Check?
- Yeah.

240
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:26,725
Murph, Tom, you guys
shut your windows?

241
00:19:31,046 --> 00:19:32,231
Murph?

242
00:19:53,527 --> 00:19:54,920
The ghost.

243
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:57,798
Grab your pillow.

244
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:00,425
You're sleeping in with Tom.

245
00:20:55,155 --> 00:20:57,024
It's not a ghost.

246
00:21:01,946 --> 00:21:03,864
It's gravity.

247
00:21:05,516 --> 00:21:07,868
I'm dropping Tom, then heading to town.

248
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:12,331
You want to clean that up
when you've finished praying to it?

249
00:21:37,589 --> 00:21:39,942
It's not Morse, Murph.
It's binary.

250
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:42,502
Thick is one, thin is zero.

251
00:21:46,765 --> 00:21:48,200
Coordinates.

252
00:21:50,686 --> 00:21:53,288
Nope. Mm-mm.

253
00:21:54,648 --> 00:21:55,916
Here we go.

254
00:21:57,401 --> 00:21:58,877
Thirty-three.

255
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:02,881
That's it.

256
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:05,842
I can't miss this!

257
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:09,346
Grandpa will be back
in a couple hours, Murph.

258
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:12,808
But you don't know
what you're gonna find.

259
00:22:13,709 --> 00:22:15,343
And that...

260
00:22:16,128 --> 00:22:18,313
is why I can't take you.

261
00:22:24,303 --> 00:22:25,529
Murph?

262
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:31,118
Grandpa will be home in a while.
Tell him I'll call him on the radio.

263
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,542
- Aah!
- Jesus.

264
00:22:39,443 --> 00:22:41,428
- What are you doing?
- Heh-heh.

265
00:22:41,528 --> 00:22:43,755
Oh, you think this is funny?
Huh?

266
00:22:43,989 --> 00:22:46,425
You wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for me.

267
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,262
Make yourself useful.

268
00:23:53,517 --> 00:23:55,251
Hey, Murph?

269
00:23:56,478 --> 00:23:58,021
Murph.

270
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:03,460
I think this is the
end of the road.

271
00:24:06,363 --> 00:24:08,507
Didn't you bring
the bolt cutters?

272
00:24:09,574 --> 00:24:10,926
That's my girl.

273
00:24:38,562 --> 00:24:39,880
Step away!

274
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:43,133
Don't shoot! I'm not armed.
My daughter's in the car.

275
00:24:48,613 --> 00:24:50,966
- Don't be afraid.
- Aah!

276
00:25:03,587 --> 00:25:05,772
How did you find this place?

277
00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:07,816
Where's my daughter?

278
00:25:08,008 --> 00:25:11,995
You had the coordinates for this facility
marked on your map. Where did you get them?

279
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:13,297
Where's my daughter?

280
00:25:13,397 --> 00:25:16,616
Don't make me take you down again.
Sit down!

281
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:19,127
Oh, you still think
you're a Marine, pal?

282
00:25:19,227 --> 00:25:21,913
Marines don't exist anymore.

283
00:25:22,105 --> 00:25:27,135
- And I got grunts like you mowing my grass.
- Where did you find those coordinates?

284
00:25:27,235 --> 00:25:29,888
But you don't look much
like a lawnmower.

285
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:32,891
Think I'll turn you
into an overqualified vacuum cleaner.

286
00:25:32,991 --> 00:25:34,301
No, you won't.

287
00:25:35,827 --> 00:25:37,846
TARS, back down, please.

288
00:25:39,247 --> 00:25:42,475
You know, you're taking a risk
using ex-military security.

289
00:25:42,834 --> 00:25:46,738
They're old, and their control units
are unpredictable.

290
00:25:46,838 --> 00:25:48,907
It's what the
government could spare.

291
00:25:50,509 --> 00:25:51,776
Who are you?

292
00:25:52,135 --> 00:25:53,537
Dr. Brand.

293
00:25:53,637 --> 00:25:56,114
I knew a Dr. Brand once.
He was a professor.

294
00:25:56,389 --> 00:25:57,991
What makes you think I'm not?

295
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:00,919
Wasn't near as cute, either.

296
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:03,622
Please, Dr. Brand.
I don't have any idea what this is.

297
00:26:04,356 --> 00:26:06,925
Now I'm scared for my daughter
and want her by my side.

298
00:26:07,025 --> 00:26:09,586
You give me that,
I'll tell you anything you want to know.

299
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:15,967
Get the principals and the girl
in the conference room, please.

300
00:26:17,402 --> 00:26:20,180
Your daughter is fine.
Bright kid.

301
00:26:20,664 --> 00:26:22,566
Must have a very smart mother.

302
00:26:22,666 --> 00:26:25,152
It's pretty clear
you don't want any visitors.

303
00:26:25,252 --> 00:26:29,314
So why don't you just let us back up from
your fence and we'll be on our way? Huh?

304
00:26:29,506 --> 00:26:32,150
- It's not that simple.
- Well, sure, it is.

305
00:26:32,384 --> 00:26:36,154
I don't know anything about you.
I don't know anything about this place.

306
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,198
Yes, you do.

307
00:26:43,812 --> 00:26:44,996
Dad!

308
00:26:47,566 --> 00:26:48,708
Hello, Cooper.

309
00:26:50,068 --> 00:26:51,211
Professor Brand.

310
00:26:52,579 --> 00:26:55,307
Explain to me how
you found this facility.

311
00:26:55,407 --> 00:26:58,769
Kind of an accident. We sort of stumbled
upon it. We were on a salvage run...

312
00:26:58,869 --> 00:27:01,646
You're sitting in the best-kept secret
in the world.

313
00:27:01,746 --> 00:27:05,350
Nobody stumbles in here.
Nobody stumbles out.

314
00:27:05,584 --> 00:27:09,863
Cooper, please.
Cooperate with these people.

315
00:27:09,963 --> 00:27:11,273
Look.

316
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:13,858
It's kind of hard to explain.

317
00:27:14,092 --> 00:27:18,914
We learned these coordinates
from an anomaly.

318
00:27:19,014 --> 00:27:20,415
What sort of anomaly?

319
00:27:20,515 --> 00:27:23,877
I hesitate to term it supernatural,
but it definitely wasn't scientific.

320
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:27,964
You're going to have to be specific,
Mr. Cooper. Right now.

321
00:27:28,064 --> 00:27:29,416
It was gravity.

322
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:37,265
Um, what sort of gravitational anomaly?
Where was this?

323
00:27:37,365 --> 00:27:40,727
Now, I'm real happy that you're excited
about gravity, bud...

324
00:27:40,827 --> 00:27:43,706
but you're not getting any answers
from us until I get assurances.

325
00:27:43,806 --> 00:27:45,598
- Assurances?
- Yeah.

326
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:49,861
Like, that we're getting out of here.
And I don't mean in the trunk of some car.

327
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:55,951
- Don't you know who we are, Coop?
- No, professor, I don't.

328
00:27:56,051 --> 00:27:58,153
You know my father, Professor Brand.

329
00:27:58,678 --> 00:28:00,071
We're NASA.

330
00:28:01,765 --> 00:28:04,075
- NASA?
- NASA.

331
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:06,202
The same NASA you flew for.

332
00:28:17,155 --> 00:28:18,890
I heard they shut you down, sir...

333
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:23,061
for refusing to drop bombs
from the stratosphere onto starving people.

334
00:28:23,161 --> 00:28:25,564
When they realized
that killing other people was...

335
00:28:25,664 --> 00:28:28,567
not a long-term solution,
then they needed us back.

336
00:28:28,667 --> 00:28:30,735
- In secret.
- Why secret?

337
00:28:30,835 --> 00:28:34,831
Because public opinion wouldn't
allow spending on space exploration.

338
00:28:34,931 --> 00:28:37,525
Not while you're struggling
to put food on the table.

339
00:28:38,843 --> 00:28:40,111
Blight.

340
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:44,707
Wheat seven years ago.
Okra this year.

341
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:46,826
Now there's just corn.

342
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,087
And we're growing more
than we ever have.

343
00:28:49,187 --> 00:28:53,458
But like the potatoes in Ireland
and the wheat in the Dust Bowl...

344
00:28:53,942 --> 00:28:56,544
the corn will die.

345
00:28:57,195 --> 00:28:58,338
Soon.

346
00:29:03,535 --> 00:29:07,222
We'll find a way, professor.
We always have.

347
00:29:07,872 --> 00:29:11,976
Driven by the unshakable faith
the Earth is ours.

348
00:29:12,377 --> 00:29:16,481
Not just ours, no.
But it is our home.

349
00:29:17,716 --> 00:29:22,996
Earth's atmosphere is 80 percent nitrogen.
We don't even breathe nitrogen.

350
00:29:23,096 --> 00:29:28,501
Blight does. And as it thrives,
our air gets less and less oxygen.

351
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:32,130
The last people to starve
will be the first to suffocate.

352
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:34,499
And your daughter's
generation...

353
00:29:35,967 --> 00:29:38,386
will be the last to
survive on Earth.

354
00:29:38,486 --> 00:29:39,787
Murph is feeling tired.

355
00:29:39,812 --> 00:29:42,197
I was wondering if she could
take a nap in my office.

356
00:29:42,574 --> 00:29:44,175
Yeah. Thank you.

357
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:48,312
Alright...

358
00:29:48,913 --> 00:29:52,517
now you need to tell me
what your plan is to save the world.

359
00:29:53,084 --> 00:29:56,688
We're not meant to save the world.
We're meant to leave it.

360
00:30:02,427 --> 00:30:03,570
Rangers.

361
00:30:03,762 --> 00:30:08,825
The last components of our one versatile
ship in orbit, the Endurance.

362
00:30:09,017 --> 00:30:10,743
Our final expedition.

363
00:30:11,436 --> 00:30:14,497
You sent people out there
looking for a new home?

364
00:30:15,023 --> 00:30:16,416
The Lazarus missions.

365
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:19,711
- Oh, that sounds cheerful.
- Lazarus came back from the dead.

366
00:30:19,944 --> 00:30:22,046
Sure, but he had to die
in the first place.

367
00:30:22,572 --> 00:30:25,350
There's not a planet in our solar system
that could sustain life...

368
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:28,019
and the nearest star's
over a thousand years away.

369
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:30,889
That doesn't even
qualify as futile.

370
00:30:32,457 --> 00:30:33,892
Where'd you send them?

371
00:30:34,209 --> 00:30:35,694
Cooper...

372
00:30:35,794 --> 00:30:40,657
I can't tell you anymore
unless you agree to pilot this craft.

373
00:30:40,757 --> 00:30:44,152
- You're the best pilot we ever had.
- I barely left the stratosphere.

374
00:30:44,344 --> 00:30:46,571
This team never
left the simulator.

375
00:30:46,805 --> 00:30:50,667
We need a pilot, and this is the mission
that you were trained for.

376
00:30:50,767 --> 00:30:52,368
Without even knowing it?

377
00:30:53,311 --> 00:30:57,632
An hour ago, you didn't even know
I was alive. You were going anyway.

378
00:30:57,732 --> 00:31:01,461
We had no choice.
But something sent you here.

379
00:31:01,694 --> 00:31:04,506
- They chose you.
- Who's "they"?

380
00:31:12,372 --> 00:31:14,390
How long would I be gone?

381
00:31:14,874 --> 00:31:18,094
Hard to know. Years?

382
00:31:18,503 --> 00:31:22,774
- I've got kids, professor.
- Get out there and save them.

383
00:31:26,052 --> 00:31:27,495
Who's "they"?

384
00:31:27,595 --> 00:31:31,624
We started detecting gravitational
anomalies almost 50 years ago.

385
00:31:31,724 --> 00:31:35,420
Mostly small distortions to our instruments
in the upper atmosphere.

386
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,748
In fact, I believe
you encountered one yourself.

387
00:31:39,315 --> 00:31:41,817
Yeah, over the Straights.

388
00:31:42,318 --> 00:31:45,430
My crash.
Something tripped my fly-by-wire.

389
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:46,839
Exactly.

390
00:31:47,574 --> 00:31:52,562
But of all these anomalies,
the most significant is this,

391
00:31:52,662 --> 00:31:54,731
Out near Saturn...

392
00:31:54,831 --> 00:31:57,016
a disturbance of space-time.

393
00:31:59,043 --> 00:32:02,272
- Is that a Wormhole?
- It appeared 48 years ago.

394
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:06,818
- And it leads where?
- Another galaxy.

395
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:10,789
A wormhole's not
a naturally occurring phenomenon.

396
00:32:10,889 --> 00:32:12,407
Someone placed it there.

397
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:14,701
- "They"?
- Mm.

398
00:32:15,101 --> 00:32:19,289
And whoever they are,
they appear to be looking out for us.

399
00:32:19,647 --> 00:32:24,386
That Wormhole lets us travel to other
stars. It came along right as we needed it.

400
00:32:24,486 --> 00:32:27,472
They've put potentially habitable worlds
right within our reach.

401
00:32:27,572 --> 00:32:29,557
Twelve, in fact,
from our initial probes.

402
00:32:29,657 --> 00:32:32,102
- You sent probes into that?
- Mm-hm.

403
00:32:32,202 --> 00:32:35,605
We sent people into it.
Ten years ago.

404
00:32:36,539 --> 00:32:38,441
The Lazarus missions.

405
00:32:38,541 --> 00:32:42,353
Twelve possible worlds,
twelve Ranger launches carrying...

406
00:32:42,712 --> 00:32:48,226
the bravest humans ever to live...
led by the remarkable Dr. Mann.

407
00:32:48,326 --> 00:32:51,496
Each person's landing pod
had enough life support for two years.

408
00:32:51,596 --> 00:32:53,623
But they could use hibernation
to stretch that...

409
00:32:53,723 --> 00:32:57,001
making observations on organics
over a decade or more.

410
00:32:57,101 --> 00:33:01,039
Their mission was to assess their world,
and if it showed potential...

411
00:33:01,272 --> 00:33:05,760
then they could send out a signal, bed down
for the long nap, wait to be rescued.

412
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:08,004
And what if the world
didn't show promise?

413
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:10,048
Hence the bravery.

414
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:13,351
You don't have the resources
to visit all 12.

415
00:33:13,451 --> 00:33:14,877
No.

416
00:33:15,453 --> 00:33:18,314
Data transmission back through
the Wormhole is rudimentary.

417
00:33:18,414 --> 00:33:23,528
Simple binary pings on an annual basis give us
some clue as to which worlds have potential.

418
00:33:23,628 --> 00:33:25,521
And one system shows promise.

419
00:33:25,755 --> 00:33:28,699
One. That's a bit
of a long shot, isn't it?

420
00:33:29,133 --> 00:33:32,070
One system with three
potential worlds?

421
00:33:32,387 --> 00:33:34,372
No long shot.

422
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,367
Okay.

423
00:33:37,976 --> 00:33:40,611
So if we find a home...

424
00:33:42,981 --> 00:33:46,542
- ...then what?
- That's the long shot.

425
00:33:46,776 --> 00:33:50,088
There's a Plan A and a Plan B.

426
00:33:50,488 --> 00:33:53,549
Did you notice anything strange
about the launch chamber?

427
00:34:05,169 --> 00:34:08,189
This entire facility's a centrifuge.

428
00:34:08,423 --> 00:34:11,025
Some kind of vehicle.
A space station?

429
00:34:11,259 --> 00:34:15,330
- Both. Plan A.
- How do you get it off the ground?

430
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:19,334
The first gravitational anomalies
changed everything.

431
00:34:19,434 --> 00:34:23,971
Suddenly we knew
that harnessing gravity was real.

432
00:34:24,105 --> 00:34:28,876
So I started working on a theory
and we started building this station.

433
00:34:29,152 --> 00:34:31,537
But you haven't solved it yet.

434
00:34:32,322 --> 00:34:33,965
That's why there's Plan B.

435
00:34:34,365 --> 00:34:39,145
The problem is gravity. How to get a viable
amount of human life off the planet.

436
00:34:39,245 --> 00:34:40,638
This is one way.

437
00:34:40,872 --> 00:34:43,474
Plan B, A population bomb.

438
00:34:43,708 --> 00:34:48,563
Over 5,000 fertilized eggs
weighing in at just under 900 kilos.

439
00:34:49,172 --> 00:34:50,740
How would you raise them?

440
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,368
With equipment on board,
we incubate the first 10.

441
00:34:53,468 --> 00:34:57,447
After that, with surrogacy,
the growth becomes exponential.

442
00:34:58,056 --> 00:35:01,417
Within 30 years,
we could have a colony of hundreds.

443
00:35:01,517 --> 00:35:04,996
The real difficulty with colonization
is genetic diversity.

444
00:35:05,521 --> 00:35:07,131
This takes care of that.

445
00:35:07,231 --> 00:35:09,792
But what about the people here?
You just...

446
00:35:10,068 --> 00:35:13,579
You give up on them? My kids?

447
00:35:13,821 --> 00:35:17,258
That's why Plan A
is a lot more fun.

448
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:22,355
- How far have you got?
- Almost there.

449
00:35:22,455 --> 00:35:24,974
You're asking me to
hang everything...

450
00:35:25,917 --> 00:35:27,351
on an almost.

451
00:35:27,794 --> 00:35:30,188
I'm asking you to trust me.

452
00:35:33,174 --> 00:35:34,942
Find us a new home.

453
00:35:35,593 --> 00:35:37,695
And by the time you return...

454
00:35:38,179 --> 00:35:40,948
I will have solved
the problem of gravity.

455
00:35:41,808 --> 00:35:43,493
I give you my word.

456
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,632
Go away!

457
00:36:08,209 --> 00:36:09,527
Murph.

458
00:36:09,627 --> 00:36:12,730
Go! If you're leaving, just go.

459
00:36:15,425 --> 00:36:18,461
This world was never
enough for you, was it, Coop?

460
00:36:19,095 --> 00:36:23,349
What, because heading out there
is what I feel like I was born to do?

461
00:36:23,808 --> 00:36:25,743
And it excites me? Heh.

462
00:36:26,352 --> 00:36:28,880
No, that does not make it wrong.

463
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:33,709
It might. Don't trust the right thing
done for the wrong reason.

464
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,763
The why of the thing,
that's the foundation.

465
00:36:36,863 --> 00:36:39,248
And the foundation's solid.

466
00:36:42,118 --> 00:36:47,223
We farmers, we sit here every year
when the rains fail and we say,

467
00:36:47,415 --> 00:36:48,766
"Next year."

468
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:53,104
Well, next year ain't gonna save us,
nor the one after that.

469
00:36:53,338 --> 00:36:58,067
This world's a treasure, Donald, but it's
been telling us to leave for a while now.

470
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:06,576
Mankind was born on Earth,
it was never meant to die here.

471
00:37:09,604 --> 00:37:12,882
Tom will be all right, but you got
to make things right with Murph.

472
00:37:12,982 --> 00:37:14,625
I will.

473
00:37:14,984 --> 00:37:18,254
Without making promises
you don't know you can keep.

474
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:30,892
You have to talk to me, Murph.

475
00:37:33,294 --> 00:37:35,488
I need to fix this before I go.

476
00:37:35,588 --> 00:37:38,566
Then I'll keep it
broken so you have to stay.

477
00:37:40,051 --> 00:37:45,156
After you kids came along, your mom said
something to me I never quite understood.

478
00:37:45,431 --> 00:37:47,558
She said, "Now..."

479
00:37:48,935 --> 00:37:53,539
"we're just here
to be memories for our kids."

480
00:37:58,569 --> 00:38:01,172
And I think that now I understand
what she meant.

481
00:38:04,826 --> 00:38:08,679
Once you're a parent,
you're the ghost of your children's future.

482
00:38:10,206 --> 00:38:12,475
You said ghosts didn't exist.

483
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,441
That's right, Murph.

484
00:38:23,553 --> 00:38:25,387
Murph, look at me.

485
00:38:27,932 --> 00:38:30,534
I can't be your ghost right now.

486
00:38:32,228 --> 00:38:34,530
I need to exist.

487
00:38:35,857 --> 00:38:37,875
They chose me.

488
00:38:38,484 --> 00:38:42,546
Murph, they chose me. You saw.
You're the one who led me to them.

489
00:38:45,074 --> 00:38:47,677
That's exactly why you can't go.

490
00:38:50,788 --> 00:38:52,848
I figured out the message.

491
00:38:53,165 --> 00:38:56,444
- One word. Know what it is?
- Murph.

492
00:38:56,544 --> 00:38:57,979
"Stay."

493
00:38:58,254 --> 00:39:01,232
- It says, "Stay," Dad.
- Murph.

494
00:39:02,091 --> 00:39:03,618
You don't believe me.

495
00:39:03,718 --> 00:39:06,579
Look at the books! Look at this.
It says, "Stay."

496
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:09,740
Why...? You're not listening!
It says, "Stay!"

497
00:39:09,974 --> 00:39:13,711
- No, I'm coming back.
- When?

498
00:39:26,324 --> 00:39:29,060
One for you, one for me.

499
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:32,430
When I'm up there in
hypersleep, or...

500
00:39:32,663 --> 00:39:36,007
traveling near the
speed of light, or...

501
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:38,694
near a black hole...

502
00:39:38,794 --> 00:39:43,641
time's gonna change for me.
It's gonna run more slowly.

503
00:39:44,926 --> 00:39:47,319
When we get back...

504
00:39:47,845 --> 00:39:49,330
we're gonna compare.

505
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:52,358
- Time will run differently for us?
- Yeah.

506
00:39:53,142 --> 00:39:57,913
By the time I get back,
we might even be the same age, you and me.

507
00:39:58,189 --> 00:40:01,524
"What?" Imagine that!

508
00:40:05,071 --> 00:40:06,305
Aw, Murph...

509
00:40:06,405 --> 00:40:09,433
You have no idea when
you're coming back.

510
00:40:10,826 --> 00:40:12,972
No idea at all!

511
00:40:15,456 --> 00:40:17,650
Murph, don't...
Don't make me leave like this.

512
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:19,351
Come on, Murph!

513
00:40:19,752 --> 00:40:22,488
Don't make me leave
like this, Murph!

514
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:30,821
Hey...

515
00:40:31,263 --> 00:40:35,251
I love you. Forever.
You hear me?

516
00:40:35,351 --> 00:40:38,862
I love you forever,
and I'm coming back.

517
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,995
I'm coming back.

518
00:41:03,921 --> 00:41:06,490
- How'd it go?
- Fine.

519
00:41:06,841 --> 00:41:08,400
Just fine.

520
00:41:14,765 --> 00:41:15,991
I love you, Tom.

521
00:41:16,434 --> 00:41:18,628
- Travel safe, huh?
- Yeah.

522
00:41:18,728 --> 00:41:21,047
You look after our place
for me, all right?

523
00:41:21,147 --> 00:41:22,873
- All right?
- Uh-huh.

524
00:41:27,478 --> 00:41:31,156
- Hey, can I use your truck while you're gone?
- You mean your truck?

525
00:41:32,158 --> 00:41:34,084
I'll make sure they
bring it back.

526
00:41:35,911 --> 00:41:38,005
Look after my kids, Donald!

527
00:41:50,176 --> 00:41:53,904
Go for main engine start. T-minus 10...

528
00:41:54,872 --> 00:41:56,624
- Dad!
- ...nine...

529
00:41:56,724 --> 00:41:58,075
Dad!

530
00:41:58,801 --> 00:42:00,445
...eight...

531
00:42:01,178 --> 00:42:03,781
- seven...
- Dad!

532
00:42:04,014 --> 00:42:05,357
...six...

533
00:42:06,533 --> 00:42:09,253
five, main engine start, four...

534
00:42:10,688 --> 00:42:11,955
three...

535
00:42:12,523 --> 00:42:13,749
two...

536
00:42:14,566 --> 00:42:16,752
one. Booster ignition and...

537
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,480
All engines look good.
Beginning roll program.

538
00:42:32,676 --> 00:42:35,613
Prepare for stage
one separation.

539
00:42:35,846 --> 00:42:36,989
Stage one.

540
00:42:42,853 --> 00:42:44,788
There is Mach 1.

541
00:42:45,648 --> 00:42:49,460
Everybody good?
Plenty of slaves for my robot colony?

542
00:42:51,237 --> 00:42:54,632
They gave him a humor setting
so he'd fit in better with his unit.

543
00:42:54,865 --> 00:42:56,600
He thinks it relaxes us.

544
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:59,595
A giant sarcastic robot.

545
00:43:00,371 --> 00:43:01,856
What a great idea!

546
00:43:01,956 --> 00:43:04,734
I have a cue light I can use
when I'm joking if you like.

547
00:43:04,834 --> 00:43:05,943
That'd probably help.

548
00:43:06,043 --> 00:43:10,064
You can use it to find your way back to the
ship after I blow you out the airlock.

549
00:43:11,048 --> 00:43:14,118
- What's your humor setting, TARS?
- That's 100 percent.

550
00:43:14,218 --> 00:43:16,111
Let's bring it on down to 75, please.

551
00:43:16,345 --> 00:43:18,280
Stage two separation.

552
00:43:28,858 --> 00:43:31,218
All feeds going manual.

553
00:43:31,318 --> 00:43:33,236
Going manual.

554
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:37,266
Deactivate probe heater one,
two and three.

555
00:43:37,366 --> 00:43:38,509
Check.

556
00:43:43,998 --> 00:43:47,017
- Taking control.
- This is handover to you.

557
00:43:50,754 --> 00:43:53,148
- A.D.F. check.
- Over.

558
00:43:53,382 --> 00:43:57,119
Pull thrusters back.
Fuel cells one, two, three.

559
00:43:57,219 --> 00:44:00,656
- One hundred percent.
- Ex-mites.

560
00:44:09,523 --> 00:44:14,336
It's hard leaving everything.
My kids. Your father.

561
00:44:14,862 --> 00:44:17,306
We're going to be spending
a lot of time together.

562
00:44:17,406 --> 00:44:20,551
- We should learn to talk.
- And when not to.

563
00:44:22,745 --> 00:44:24,355
Just being honest.

564
00:44:24,455 --> 00:44:26,890
I don't think you need
to be that honest.

565
00:44:27,208 --> 00:44:29,693
Hey, TARS, what's your
honesty parameter?

566
00:44:29,793 --> 00:44:32,488
- Ninety percent.
- Ninety percent?

567
00:44:32,588 --> 00:44:35,286
Absolute honesty isn't always
the most diplomatic,

568
00:44:35,386 --> 00:44:38,452
nor the safest form of communication
with emotional beings.

569
00:44:38,552 --> 00:44:40,112
Okay.

570
00:44:40,471 --> 00:44:43,198
Ninety percent it is,
Dr. Brand.

571
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:50,122
We are coming up on the Endurance.
Twelve minutes out.

572
00:45:07,122 --> 00:45:09,224
Okay. Taking control.

573
00:45:12,586 --> 00:45:15,564
Approaching module
port, 500 meters.

574
00:45:28,477 --> 00:45:29,703
It's all you, Doyle.

575
00:45:48,163 --> 00:45:50,724
Nice and easy, Doyle.
Nice and easy.

576
00:45:55,796 --> 00:45:58,449
- I feel good.
- Take us home.

577
00:46:06,181 --> 00:46:08,484
- Lock.
- Target locked.

578
00:46:08,584 --> 00:46:10,586
- Well done.
- Okay, helmets on.

579
00:46:10,686 --> 00:46:11,829
Good job.

580
00:46:45,179 --> 00:46:48,699
Door's not charging. Never mind.

581
00:47:11,372 --> 00:47:13,182
Cooper, you should have control.

582
00:47:13,415 --> 00:47:15,017
Control here.

583
00:47:16,335 --> 00:47:19,062
Communication with
ring module active.

584
00:47:25,427 --> 00:47:27,070
Oh, wow.

585
00:47:32,768 --> 00:47:34,036
That's initiate.

586
00:47:41,485 --> 00:47:44,087
- Are we ready to spin?
- Just a sec.

587
00:47:55,416 --> 00:47:57,851
- Hello, CASE.
- Hello, TARS.

588
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:00,729
All right, we're all set.

589
00:48:01,088 --> 00:48:02,689
All right, let's do it.

590
00:48:20,899 --> 00:48:22,501
Heh.

591
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:33,136
Thirty percent of spin.

592
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:41,395
One G.

593
00:48:42,045 --> 00:48:44,147
How's gravity treating
you back there?

594
00:48:44,381 --> 00:48:46,049
Well.

595
00:48:48,719 --> 00:48:50,579
Romilly? Hey, you okay?

596
00:48:50,679 --> 00:48:51,789
- Yeah.
- You all right?

597
00:48:51,889 --> 00:48:54,074
Mm. Yeah, I just need a minute.

598
00:48:54,391 --> 00:48:57,683
I think we have some Dramamine
in the hab pod, I'm just gonna get that

599
00:48:57,783 --> 00:48:59,643
or maybe in the cryo-beds.
I'll just be a sec.

600
00:48:59,743 --> 00:49:01,498
- Hey, Brand?
- Yeah?

601
00:49:01,732 --> 00:49:03,359
- Bring a lot.
- Heh-heh-heh.

602
00:49:12,034 --> 00:49:15,012
Amelia, be safe.

603
00:49:15,245 --> 00:49:18,816
- Give my regards to Dr. Mann.
- I will, Dad.

604
00:49:18,916 --> 00:49:24,438
It looks good for your trajectory.
We've calculated two years to Saturn.

605
00:49:24,888 --> 00:49:26,690
That's a lot of Dramamine.

606
00:49:27,299 --> 00:49:29,860
Look after my family,
will you, please, sir?

607
00:49:30,302 --> 00:49:33,396
We'll be waiting for you
when you get back.

608
00:49:33,597 --> 00:49:37,534
A little older, a little wiser,
but happy to see you.

609
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:43,707
<i>Do not go gentle into that good night.</i>

610
00:49:44,074 --> 00:49:48,420
<i>Old age should burn
and rave at close of day.</i>

611
00:49:49,488 --> 00:49:54,551
<i>Rage, rage against
the dying of the light.</i>

612
00:49:55,327 --> 00:49:59,222
<i>Though wise men at their end
Know dark is right.</i>

613
00:49:59,456 --> 00:50:02,434
<i>Because their words had forked
No lightning they.</i>

614
00:50:02,751 --> 00:50:06,396
<i>Do not go gentle
into that good night.</i>

615
00:50:06,964 --> 00:50:11,601
<i>Rage, rage against
the dying of the light.</i>

616
00:50:27,901 --> 00:50:29,670
- You good?
- Yeah.

617
00:50:30,487 --> 00:50:32,089
Okay, thank you, sir.

618
00:50:35,492 --> 00:50:37,127
Here. Pills.

619
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:41,298
So alone.

620
00:50:41,498 --> 00:50:43,525
We have each other.
Dr. Mann had it worse.

621
00:50:43,625 --> 00:50:45,068
No, I mean them.

622
00:50:45,168 --> 00:50:46,361
Hm?

623
00:50:46,461 --> 00:50:49,856
It's a perfect planet,
and we won't find another one like her.

624
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:53,694
No, it's not like looking
for a new condo.

625
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,988
The human race is going to be...

626
00:50:57,189 --> 00:50:58,499
adrift...

627
00:50:58,599 --> 00:51:02,202
desperate for a rock it can cling to
while it catches its breath.

628
00:51:02,686 --> 00:51:04,621
We need to find that rock.

629
00:51:04,855 --> 00:51:09,710
And our three prospects are at the edge
of what might sustain human life.

630
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:12,638
Laura Miller's planet is first.

631
00:51:12,738 --> 00:51:14,965
- Laura started our biology program.
- Mm-hm.

632
00:51:19,870 --> 00:51:23,140
- Uh, Wolf Edmunds is here.
- Tell me about Edmunds.

633
00:51:23,874 --> 00:51:26,927
Oh, uh... Wolf's a
particle physicist.

634
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:31,356
None of them had families, huh?

635
00:51:32,299 --> 00:51:35,244
No. No attachments.
My father insisted.

636
00:51:35,344 --> 00:51:38,956
They all knew the odds against
ever seeing another human being again.

637
00:51:39,056 --> 00:51:41,083
I'm hoping we can surprise
at least three of them.

638
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:43,168
- How about Mann?
- Dr. Mann?

639
00:51:43,268 --> 00:51:45,254
He's remarkable.
He's the best of us.

640
00:51:45,354 --> 00:51:49,800
He inspired 11 people to follow him
on the loneliest journey in human history.

641
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:51,552
Scientists, explorers.

642
00:51:51,652 --> 00:51:55,839
That's what I love.
You know, out there we face great odds.

643
00:51:56,239 --> 00:51:57,958
Death, but...

644
00:51:59,409 --> 00:52:00,844
not evil.

645
00:52:01,036 --> 00:52:02,888
You don't think
nature can be evil?

646
00:52:03,163 --> 00:52:06,132
No. Formidable. Frightening.
But...

647
00:52:06,625 --> 00:52:08,727
- ...no, not evil.
- Hm.

648
00:52:09,878 --> 00:52:13,190
Is a lion evil
because it rips a gazelle to shreds?

649
00:52:13,590 --> 00:52:15,992
Just what we take with us, then.

650
00:52:16,134 --> 00:52:17,477
Yeah.

651
00:52:17,594 --> 00:52:19,746
This crew represents
the best of humanity.

652
00:52:19,846 --> 00:52:21,081
Even me, huh?

653
00:52:21,181 --> 00:52:23,250
You know what?
We agreed, 90 percent.

654
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:24,751
There you go.

655
00:52:24,851 --> 00:52:27,296
- Don't stay up.
- I'll be there in a minute.

656
00:52:27,396 --> 00:52:31,541
Just remember, Coop,
you are literally wasting your breath.

657
00:52:38,115 --> 00:52:41,384
Hey, TARS? Let's go over
that trajectory one more time.

658
00:52:41,618 --> 00:52:43,386
Eight months to Mars.

659
00:52:43,787 --> 00:52:46,690
Counter-orbital slingshot around.
Fourteen months to Saturn.

660
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:48,275
Nothing's changed on that.

661
00:52:48,375 --> 00:52:50,560
Just let me ask you something.

662
00:52:52,713 --> 00:52:56,274
- Dr. Brand and Edmunds...
- Why are you whispering? They can't hear you.

663
00:52:57,634 --> 00:53:00,704
Dr. Brand and Edmunds.
They close?

664
00:53:00,804 --> 00:53:02,289
I wouldn't know.

665
00:53:02,389 --> 00:53:05,359
Is that 90 percent "wouldn't know"
or 10 percent "wouldn't know"?

666
00:53:05,459 --> 00:53:08,288
- I also have a discretion setting, Cooper.
- Aah.

667
00:53:10,147 --> 00:53:12,415
But not a poker face, Slick.

668
00:53:24,661 --> 00:53:26,212
Hey, guys.

669
00:53:26,329 --> 00:53:29,516
Uh, Dad's about to go down
for the long nap.

670
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:32,444
So I wanted to give
you an update.

671
00:53:32,544 --> 00:53:33,770
Uh...

672
00:53:34,212 --> 00:53:37,465
The Earth looks amazing from here.
Um...

673
00:53:38,467 --> 00:53:41,370
You can't see any of the dust.
Heh.

674
00:53:42,703 --> 00:53:45,699
I really hope you
guys are doing great.

675
00:53:45,932 --> 00:53:48,641
I know you're gonna get this message.
Professor Brand's assured me that...

676
00:53:48,741 --> 00:53:50,200
he's gonna get it to you.

677
00:53:50,729 --> 00:53:52,873
Know that I love you.

678
00:53:54,191 --> 00:53:56,626
- Is it him?
- I don't think so, Murph.

679
00:54:03,408 --> 00:54:05,176
You must be Donald.

680
00:54:07,287 --> 00:54:08,555
Hello, Murph.

681
00:54:09,206 --> 00:54:11,308
Why are you in my dad's truck?

682
00:54:11,833 --> 00:54:14,102
He wanted me
to bring it for your brother.

683
00:54:14,753 --> 00:54:17,022
He sent you a message.

684
00:54:20,008 --> 00:54:22,077
She's pretty upset
with him for leaving.

685
00:54:22,177 --> 00:54:26,364
If you record any messages,
I can get them to transmit it to Cooper.

686
00:54:27,349 --> 00:54:30,118
Murph is a bright spark.

687
00:54:31,019 --> 00:54:33,630
Maybe I should fan the flame.

688
00:54:33,730 --> 00:54:36,383
She's already making fools
of her teachers.

689
00:54:36,483 --> 00:54:39,619
So maybe she should come
and make a fool out of you.

690
00:54:40,403 --> 00:54:43,540
- So where are they?
- Heading for Mars.

691
00:54:43,949 --> 00:54:47,953
The next time you hear from Cooper,
they'll be coming up on Saturn.

692
00:55:28,848 --> 00:55:33,056
...administration wants
me to repeat Plant Pathology. Which sucks.

693
00:55:33,456 --> 00:55:36,768
But they said I could start
Advanced Agriculture a year early.

694
00:55:38,461 --> 00:55:42,440
All right, I got to go, Dad.
Hope you're safe up there.

695
00:55:46,386 --> 00:55:48,038
Um, sorry, Coop.

696
00:55:48,138 --> 00:55:53,076
I asked Murph to say hi,
but she's as stubborn as her old man.

697
00:55:53,393 --> 00:55:55,328
I'll try again next time.

698
00:56:10,243 --> 00:56:11,895
You all right, Rom?

699
00:56:14,164 --> 00:56:17,934
This gets to me, Cooper.
This. This.

700
00:56:18,335 --> 00:56:21,279
Millimeters of aluminum, that's it,
and then nothing...

701
00:56:21,379 --> 00:56:25,442
out there for millions of miles
won't kill us in seconds.

702
00:56:26,259 --> 00:56:28,245
You know that some
of the finest...

703
00:56:28,345 --> 00:56:32,282
solo yachtsmen in the world
don't know how to swim?

704
00:56:32,766 --> 00:56:36,036
They don't know how. And if they
go overboard, psst, they're done.

705
00:56:37,687 --> 00:56:39,748
We're explorers, Rom.

706
00:56:41,191 --> 00:56:44,594
This is our boat. Here.

707
00:57:11,304 --> 00:57:13,123
This is from the, uh... relay probe?

708
00:57:13,223 --> 00:57:15,366
It was in orbit
around the Wormhole.

709
00:57:15,767 --> 00:57:18,879
This is the Wormhole,
and every time we'd come around...

710
00:57:18,979 --> 00:57:22,290
we would receive images
from the other side of the foreign galaxy.

711
00:57:22,524 --> 00:57:24,718
Oh, yeah.
Like swinging a periscope around.

712
00:57:24,818 --> 00:57:25,969
Exactly.

713
00:57:26,069 --> 00:57:30,673
So we got a pretty good idea what we're
gonna find on the other side, huh?

714
00:57:31,658 --> 00:57:33,093
Navigationally.

715
00:57:34,452 --> 00:57:38,506
Guys? Looks like we'll be approaching
the Wormhole in about three hours.

716
00:57:44,587 --> 00:57:45,930
Hey, Coop?

717
00:57:46,506 --> 00:57:49,576
- Can we stop the spinning?
- Why?

718
00:57:49,676 --> 00:57:52,312
Because we're close enough
to see it now?

719
00:57:53,847 --> 00:57:55,040
All right.

720
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:56,324
Thanks.

721
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:04,007
There, that's it!
That's the Wormhole!

722
00:58:04,107 --> 00:58:07,636
Say it, don't spray it, Rom.
It's a sphere.

723
00:58:07,736 --> 00:58:11,998
Of course it is. What, you...?
You thought it would just be a hole?

724
00:58:12,907 --> 00:58:16,094
No, it's just that all the illustrations
I've ever seen, they...

725
00:58:16,536 --> 00:58:19,722
In the illustrations,
they're trying to show you how it works.

726
00:58:20,331 --> 00:58:24,402
So they say you want to go
from here to there.

727
00:58:24,502 --> 00:58:26,826
- But it's too far, right?
- Mm-hm.

728
00:58:27,213 --> 00:58:32,110
So a Wormhole bends space like this,
so you can take a shortcut through...

729
00:58:32,343 --> 00:58:33,995
a higher dimension.

730
00:58:34,095 --> 00:58:35,655
Okay, so...

731
00:58:35,889 --> 00:58:38,826
to show that,
they've turned three-dimensional space

732
00:58:38,926 --> 00:58:44,005
into two dimensions which turns a Wormhole
into two dimensions, a circle.

733
00:58:44,105 --> 00:58:46,657
What's a circle in
three dimensions?

734
00:58:47,567 --> 00:58:49,169
- A sphere.
- Exactly.

735
00:58:49,486 --> 00:58:51,087
A spherical hole.

736
00:58:51,529 --> 00:58:54,465
But who put it there?
Who do we have to thank?

737
00:58:54,783 --> 00:58:59,554
I'm not thanking anybody until we
get out of here in one piece, Rom.

738
00:59:06,469 --> 00:59:08,488
Any trick to this, Doyle?

739
00:59:09,422 --> 00:59:11,191
No one knows.

740
00:59:18,223 --> 00:59:19,991
The others made it, right?

741
00:59:21,935 --> 00:59:23,703
At least some of them.

742
00:59:55,552 --> 00:59:58,821
Everybody ready to say goodbye
to our solar system?

743
00:59:59,597 --> 01:00:01,699
To our galaxy.

744
01:00:03,518 --> 01:00:04,661
Here we go.

745
01:00:37,177 --> 01:00:40,747
The controls won't work here.
We're passing through the bulk.

746
01:00:40,847 --> 01:00:45,368
It's space beyond our three dimensions.
All you can do is record and observe.

747
01:00:56,446 --> 01:00:57,588
What is that?

748
01:00:59,866 --> 01:01:03,970
- I think it's them.
- Distorting space-time.

749
01:01:05,955 --> 01:01:07,140
Don't! Don't!

750
01:01:35,068 --> 01:01:36,619
What was that?

751
01:01:39,322 --> 01:01:40,923
The first handshake.

752
01:01:42,492 --> 01:01:43,934
We're...

753
01:01:45,161 --> 01:01:46,796
We're here.

754
01:02:06,849 --> 01:02:09,169
So the lost communications came through.

755
01:02:09,269 --> 01:02:12,213
- How?
- The relay on this side cached them.

756
01:02:12,313 --> 01:02:15,958
So years of basic data.
No real surprises.

757
01:02:16,776 --> 01:02:20,480
Miller's site has kept pinging thumbs up,
as has Dr. Mann's. Um...

758
01:02:20,580 --> 01:02:22,974
Edmunds' went down
three years ago.

759
01:02:23,074 --> 01:02:24,350
Transmitter failure?

760
01:02:24,450 --> 01:02:27,520
Maybe. He was sending the thumbs up
right until it went dark.

761
01:02:27,620 --> 01:02:29,439
But Miller's still
looks good though, right?

762
01:02:29,539 --> 01:02:31,933
- Because she's coming up fast.
- Mm-hm.

763
01:02:32,292 --> 01:02:34,394
With one complication.

764
01:02:34,711 --> 01:02:37,780
The planet is much closer to Gargantua
than we thought.

765
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:40,617
- Gargantua?
- It's what we're calling the black hole.

766
01:02:40,717 --> 01:02:43,077
Miller's and Dr. Mann's planets
both orbit it.

767
01:02:43,177 --> 01:02:46,456
- And Miller's is on the horizon?
- As a basketball around a hoop.

768
01:02:46,556 --> 01:02:48,625
Landing there takes us
dangerously close.

769
01:02:48,725 --> 01:02:52,078
And a black hole that big
has a huge gravitational pull.

770
01:02:54,564 --> 01:02:57,634
Look, I could swing around
that neutron star to decelerate.

771
01:02:57,734 --> 01:02:59,477
No, it's not that. It's time.

772
01:02:59,577 --> 01:03:04,382
The gravity on that planet will slow
our clock compared to Earth's drastically.

773
01:03:04,907 --> 01:03:06,142
How bad?

774
01:03:06,242 --> 01:03:09,887
Every hour we spend
on that planet will be...

775
01:03:10,663 --> 01:03:12,932
seven years back on Earth.

776
01:03:13,708 --> 01:03:14,851
Jesus.

777
01:03:15,084 --> 01:03:16,853
Well, that's relativity, folks.

778
01:03:18,171 --> 01:03:20,698
Well, we can't just drop down
there without...

779
01:03:20,798 --> 01:03:22,742
Cooper, we have a mission.

780
01:03:22,842 --> 01:03:25,495
Yeah, Doyle, we have a mission,
and our mission Plan A is...

781
01:03:25,595 --> 01:03:28,831
to find a planet that can habitate the
people that are living on Earth right now.

782
01:03:28,931 --> 01:03:31,834
You can't just think about your family.
Now you have to think bigger than that.

783
01:03:31,934 --> 01:03:35,013
I am thinking about my family
and millions of other families, okay?

784
01:03:35,113 --> 01:03:39,667
Plan A does not work if the people on Earth
are dead by the time we pull it off.

785
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:44,630
No. It doesn't.
That's why there's a Plan B.

786
01:03:46,449 --> 01:03:49,492
Okay. Cooper's right.
We need to think of time as a resource,

787
01:03:49,592 --> 01:03:52,054
just like oxygen and food.
Going down it's gonna cost us.

788
01:03:54,332 --> 01:03:56,000
All right, look.

789
01:03:56,793 --> 01:04:00,321
Dr. Mann's data is promising,
but it's gonna take months to get there.

790
01:04:00,421 --> 01:04:02,699
And Edmunds', it's even further.

791
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:07,036
Miller hasn't sent much, but what she has is
very promising. It's water, it's organics...

792
01:04:07,136 --> 01:04:09,372
- You don't find that every day.
- No, you don't.

793
01:04:09,472 --> 01:04:11,874
And just think about the resources,
including time...

794
01:04:11,974 --> 01:04:14,577
that would be spent
trying to get back here.

795
01:04:15,603 --> 01:04:17,063
- Romilly...
- Yeah?

796
01:04:17,163 --> 01:04:21,467
...how far off from Miller's planet do we
have to be to stay out of the time shift?

797
01:04:21,567 --> 01:04:23,303
Just back from the cusp.

798
01:04:23,403 --> 01:04:26,431
All right, which is here,
just outside of Miller's planet.

799
01:04:26,531 --> 01:04:28,424
- Right.
- Okay.

800
01:04:29,242 --> 01:04:32,103
Here's Gargantua.
Here's Miller's planet.

801
01:04:32,203 --> 01:04:35,440
Instead of taking the Endurance
into orbit around Miller's planet...

802
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:38,484
which would conserve fuel,
but we would lose a lot of time...

803
01:04:38,584 --> 01:04:41,752
what if we take a wider orbit
around Gargantua,

804
01:04:41,852 --> 01:04:45,408
parallel with Miller's planet
outside of this time shift, to here?

805
01:04:45,508 --> 01:04:48,369
Then we take the Ranger down,
we get Miller, we get her samples.

806
01:04:48,469 --> 01:04:51,247
We come back, we analyze, we debrief.
We're in, we're out.

807
01:04:51,347 --> 01:04:53,750
We lose a little fuel,
but we save a whole lot of time.

808
01:04:53,850 --> 01:04:55,552
- That'll work.
- That's good.

809
01:04:55,652 --> 01:04:58,179
There's no time for monkey business
or chit-chat down there.

810
01:04:58,279 --> 01:05:01,141
So, TARS,
you should definitely stay here.

811
01:05:01,241 --> 01:05:03,760
CASE, you're with me.
Anyone else can stay.

812
01:05:03,860 --> 01:05:07,978
If we're talking about a couple years,
I could use the time to research gravity.

813
01:05:08,078 --> 01:05:10,641
Observations from the Wormhole,
that's gold to Professor Brand.

814
01:05:10,741 --> 01:05:12,477
TARS, factor an orbit of Gargantua.

815
01:05:12,577 --> 01:05:17,398
Conserve fuel, minimize thrusting, but make
sure we stay in range of Miller's planet.

816
01:05:17,498 --> 01:05:20,109
- You got it?
- I wouldn't leave you behind...

817
01:05:20,209 --> 01:05:21,352
Dr. Brand.

818
01:05:25,923 --> 01:05:27,650
- You ready, CASE?
- Yup.

819
01:05:28,509 --> 01:05:32,113
- You don't say much, do you?
- TARS talks plenty for both of us.

820
01:05:33,222 --> 01:05:34,365
Detach.

821
01:05:41,564 --> 01:05:44,625
- Romilly, are you reading these forces?
- It's unbelievable.

822
01:05:47,737 --> 01:05:50,264
A literal heart of darkness.

823
01:05:54,035 --> 01:05:56,813
If we could just see
the collapsed star inside...

824
01:05:56,913 --> 01:05:59,765
the singularity, yeah,
we'd solve gravity.

825
01:06:00,082 --> 01:06:03,444
- And we can't get anything from it?
- Nothing escapes that horizon.

826
01:06:03,544 --> 01:06:04,946
Not even light.

827
01:06:05,046 --> 01:06:08,649
- The answer's there, just no way to see it.
- There's Miller's planet.

828
01:06:11,219 --> 01:06:13,253
Goodbye, Ranger.

829
01:06:25,358 --> 01:06:27,718
This is fast for atmospheric entry.

830
01:06:27,818 --> 01:06:30,171
- Should we use the thrusters to slow?
- No.

831
01:06:30,530 --> 01:06:33,933
I'm gonna use the Ranger's aerodynamics
to save some fuel.

832
01:06:34,033 --> 01:06:35,309
Air brake?

833
01:06:35,409 --> 01:06:39,021
- We want to get down fast, don't we?
- We want to get there in one piece.

834
01:06:39,121 --> 01:06:42,224
- Hang on.
- Brand, Doyle, get ready.

835
01:06:57,974 --> 01:07:00,543
- We should ease!
- Hands where I can see them.

836
01:07:00,643 --> 01:07:04,046
The only time I went down was when a
machine was easing at the wrong time.

837
01:07:04,146 --> 01:07:07,049
- A little caution...
- Can get you killed, like reckless driving.

838
01:07:07,149 --> 01:07:09,418
- Cooper, it's too damn fast!
- I got this.

839
01:07:14,156 --> 01:07:18,260
- Should I disable the feedback?
- No. I need to feel the air.

840
01:07:22,364 --> 01:07:23,632
Here we go.

841
01:07:26,627 --> 01:07:28,020
It's just water!

842
01:07:29,422 --> 01:07:31,023
The stuff of life.

843
01:07:31,382 --> 01:07:32,867
Twelve hundred meters.

844
01:07:32,967 --> 01:07:35,077
- Do we have a fix on the beacon?
- Got it!

845
01:07:35,177 --> 01:07:37,872
- Can you maneuver?
- I'll need to shave some speed.

846
01:07:37,972 --> 01:07:40,700
I'm gonna spiral down on top of it.
Everybody hang on!

847
01:07:43,019 --> 01:07:44,161
Seven hundred.

848
01:07:46,188 --> 01:07:48,290
On my cue, CASE.
On my cue.

849
01:07:51,694 --> 01:07:53,295
Five hundred meters.

850
01:08:02,663 --> 01:08:03,806
Fire!

851
01:08:17,261 --> 01:08:19,697
- Very graceful.
- No.

852
01:08:20,222 --> 01:08:23,408
But very efficient.

853
01:08:24,769 --> 01:08:27,046
What are you waiting for?
Let's go!

854
01:08:27,146 --> 01:08:29,165
Go, go, go!

855
01:08:29,282 --> 01:08:32,835
Seven years per hour here.
Let's make it count!

856
01:08:58,844 --> 01:09:00,196
This way.

857
01:09:02,932 --> 01:09:04,784
About 200 meters.

858
01:09:14,193 --> 01:09:16,320
The gravity's punishing.

859
01:09:16,779 --> 01:09:18,973
Been floating through
space too long?

860
01:09:19,073 --> 01:09:21,350
110% Earth gravity.

861
01:09:21,450 --> 01:09:23,752
Come on. Come on.

862
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:29,016
- There's nothing here.
- Should be right here.

863
01:09:30,835 --> 01:09:34,138
If the signal's
coming from here, then...

864
01:09:43,472 --> 01:09:45,140
Her beacon.

865
01:09:52,773 --> 01:09:53,916
Wreckage.

866
01:09:54,483 --> 01:09:55,751
Where's the rest?

867
01:09:56,152 --> 01:09:57,753
Towards the mountains!

868
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:03,425
Those aren't mountains.

869
01:10:04,994 --> 01:10:06,428
They're waves.

870
01:10:11,667 --> 01:10:14,436
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

871
01:10:14,837 --> 01:10:16,939
That one's moving away from us.

872
01:10:23,345 --> 01:10:25,114
We need the recorder.

873
01:10:35,191 --> 01:10:37,510
Brand, Doyle, back
to the Ranger now!

874
01:10:37,610 --> 01:10:41,055
We're not leaving
without her data.

875
01:10:41,155 --> 01:10:44,433
Get back here now!
We do not have time!

876
01:10:44,533 --> 01:10:47,094
The second wave is coming!
We're in the middle of a swell.

877
01:10:48,287 --> 01:10:49,772
No, I got it.

878
01:10:49,872 --> 01:10:51,974
Get your ass back
to the Ranger now!

879
01:10:56,879 --> 01:10:59,023
Brand, get back here now!

880
01:11:00,883 --> 01:11:03,193
No, Cooper, go.
Cooper, go. I can't make it.

881
01:11:03,511 --> 01:11:05,988
- Go!
- CASE, go get her.

882
01:11:10,684 --> 01:11:12,786
- Go!
- Get up. Get up, Brand!

883
01:11:13,604 --> 01:11:15,205
Go, go! Go!

884
01:11:16,690 --> 01:11:19,627
- I'm not gonna make it!
- Yes, you are. Yes, you are!

885
01:11:26,367 --> 01:11:28,761
Come on, CASE has her!
Get back here, Doyle!

886
01:11:31,664 --> 01:11:33,048
Come on!

887
01:11:35,501 --> 01:11:37,019
Get to the hatch!

888
01:11:41,465 --> 01:11:43,067
Go, go! Go!

889
01:11:48,514 --> 01:11:49,698
Shit.

890
01:11:50,099 --> 01:11:52,034
Manually overriding
inside hatch!

891
01:11:55,437 --> 01:11:56,705
Cooper! Wait!

892
01:12:03,946 --> 01:12:07,716
The engines are flooded!
I'm gonna have to shut her down.

893
01:12:41,066 --> 01:12:42,501
Holy shit.

894
01:12:46,822 --> 01:12:48,257
Hang on!

895
01:13:19,396 --> 01:13:23,333
- CASE, what's the problem?
- Too waterlogged. Let it drain.

896
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:25,636
Goddamn it!

897
01:13:25,736 --> 01:13:30,474
- I told you to leave me! Why didn't you?
- And I told you to get your ass back here!

898
01:13:30,574 --> 01:13:35,345
- One of us was thinking about the mission!
- You were thinking about getting home.

899
01:13:37,081 --> 01:13:39,483
I was trying to do
the right thing!

900
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:41,643
Can you tell that to Doyle?

901
01:13:43,637 --> 01:13:46,106
- CASE, how much time?
- Forty-five to an hour.

902
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:51,588
The stuff of life, huh?
What's this gonna cost us, Brand?

903
01:13:52,388 --> 01:13:54,415
A lot. Decades.

904
01:14:01,563 --> 01:14:02,998
What happened to Miller?

905
01:14:03,649 --> 01:14:09,263
Judging by the wreckage, she was
broken up by a wave soon after impact.

906
01:14:09,363 --> 01:14:12,299
How's the wreckage stayed together
after all these years, huh?

907
01:14:13,450 --> 01:14:15,752
Because of the time slippage.

908
01:14:16,578 --> 01:14:21,183
On this planet's time,
she just landed hours ago.

909
01:14:22,001 --> 01:14:24,445
She probably just
died minutes ago.

910
01:14:24,545 --> 01:14:28,690
The data Doyle received was just
the initial status echoing endlessly.

911
01:14:28,966 --> 01:14:31,235
Oh, we are not
prepared for this.

912
01:14:33,512 --> 01:14:37,041
You eggheads have the survival skills
of a Boy Scout troop.

913
01:14:37,141 --> 01:14:40,461
Well, we got this far on our brains.
Farther than any human in history.

914
01:14:40,561 --> 01:14:42,379
Well, not far enough!

915
01:14:42,479 --> 01:14:46,083
And now we're stuck here till there
won't be anyone left on Earth to save.

916
01:14:49,028 --> 01:14:51,797
I'm counting every minute,
same as you, Cooper.

917
01:14:56,493 --> 01:14:58,395
Is there any possibility...

918
01:14:58,495 --> 01:15:02,191
I don't know, some kind of a way
we can maybe all jump in a black hole?

919
01:15:02,291 --> 01:15:04,059
Gain back the years?

920
01:15:04,626 --> 01:15:06,195
Don't shake your head at me.

921
01:15:06,295 --> 01:15:08,364
Time is relative, okay?

922
01:15:08,464 --> 01:15:11,608
It can stretch
and it can squeeze, but...

923
01:15:12,009 --> 01:15:14,286
it can't run backwards.
It just can't.

924
01:15:14,386 --> 01:15:18,907
The only thing that can move across
dimensions, like time, is gravity.

925
01:15:21,518 --> 01:15:22,986
Okay.

926
01:15:24,646 --> 01:15:28,592
The beings that led us here,
they communicate...

927
01:15:28,692 --> 01:15:30,594
- ...through gravity, right?
- Yes.

928
01:15:30,694 --> 01:15:32,963
Could they be talking to us
from the future?

929
01:15:33,781 --> 01:15:36,133
- Maybe.
- Okay. If they can...

930
01:15:37,242 --> 01:15:40,596
"They" are beings
of five dimensions.

931
01:15:40,913 --> 01:15:44,349
To them, time might be
another physical dimension.

932
01:15:44,583 --> 01:15:46,018
To them...

933
01:15:46,335 --> 01:15:50,572
the past might be a canyon
that they can climb into and the future...

934
01:15:50,672 --> 01:15:53,775
a mountain they can climb up.
But to us, it's not, okay?

935
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:58,279
Look, Cooper, I screwed up.
I'm sorry.

936
01:15:59,348 --> 01:16:02,701
- But you knew about relativity.
- Oh.

937
01:16:04,311 --> 01:16:05,979
Brand...

938
01:16:10,359 --> 01:16:12,578
my daughter was 10 years old.

939
01:16:12,903 --> 01:16:15,797
I couldn't teach her
Einstein's theories before I left.

940
01:16:16,115 --> 01:16:19,051
Couldn't you have told her
you were going to save the world?

941
01:16:19,535 --> 01:16:21,077
No.

942
01:16:22,246 --> 01:16:26,716
When you become a parent,
one thing becomes really clear.

943
01:16:27,918 --> 01:16:31,188
And that is that you want to make sure
your children feel safe.

944
01:16:32,131 --> 01:16:36,284
And it rules out telling a 10-year-old
that the world is ending.

945
01:16:38,245 --> 01:16:39,821
Cooper?

946
01:16:43,433 --> 01:16:46,003
- How long for the engines, CASE?
- A minute or two.

947
01:16:46,103 --> 01:16:48,288
We don't have it. Helmets on!

948
01:16:52,109 --> 01:16:53,969
Brand, co-pilot, you're up.

949
01:16:54,069 --> 01:16:56,638
CASE, blow the cabin oxygen
through the main thrusters!

950
01:16:56,738 --> 01:16:58,548
- We're gonna spark it.
- Roger that.

951
01:16:58,740 --> 01:17:00,175
- Locked.
- Depressurizing.

952
01:17:05,956 --> 01:17:07,307
Engines up!

953
01:17:36,069 --> 01:17:37,671
Hello, Rom.

954
01:17:38,030 --> 01:17:39,998
I've waited years.

955
01:17:40,782 --> 01:17:43,318
How...? How many years?

956
01:17:44,453 --> 01:17:47,481
- By now it must be...
- Twenty-three years...

957
01:17:47,581 --> 01:17:49,591
four months, eight days.

958
01:17:53,712 --> 01:17:55,380
Doyle?

959
01:18:01,094 --> 01:18:04,297
I thought I was prepared.
I knew the theory.

960
01:18:05,474 --> 01:18:07,075
Reality's different.

961
01:18:08,018 --> 01:18:09,787
And Miller?

962
01:18:10,771 --> 01:18:12,873
There's nothing here for us.

963
01:18:15,625 --> 01:18:17,127
Why didn't you sleep?

964
01:18:17,986 --> 01:18:22,174
Oh, I had a couple of stretches. But I
stopped believing you were coming back.

965
01:18:22,574 --> 01:18:25,677
And something seemed wrong
about dreaming my life away.

966
01:18:26,411 --> 01:18:29,348
I learned what I could
from the black hole...

967
01:18:29,623 --> 01:18:32,151
but I couldn't send anything
to your father.

968
01:18:32,251 --> 01:18:34,570
We've been receiving,
but nothing gets out.

969
01:18:34,670 --> 01:18:37,055
- Is he alive?
- Oh, yeah.

970
01:18:37,172 --> 01:18:39,366
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

971
01:18:41,969 --> 01:18:45,072
We've got years of messages stored.

972
01:18:45,264 --> 01:18:46,498
Cooper.

973
01:18:46,598 --> 01:18:49,901
Messages span 23 years.

974
01:18:51,645 --> 01:18:53,413
Play it from the beginning.

975
01:18:56,358 --> 01:18:58,368
Hey, Dad.

976
01:18:58,902 --> 01:19:01,621
Checking in. Saying hi.

977
01:19:02,406 --> 01:19:03,974
Um...

978
01:19:04,074 --> 01:19:06,167
Finished second in school.

979
01:19:07,452 --> 01:19:10,063
Miss Kurling's still
giving me C's though.

980
01:19:10,163 --> 01:19:13,300
Pulled me down, but
seconds not bad.

981
01:19:14,167 --> 01:19:16,736
Grandpa attended the ceremony.

982
01:19:17,963 --> 01:19:20,065
Um... Oh.

983
01:19:20,924 --> 01:19:22,951
I met another girl, Dad.

984
01:19:23,051 --> 01:19:24,936
I, uh...

985
01:19:25,387 --> 01:19:27,689
I really think this is the one.

986
01:19:28,682 --> 01:19:31,968
Name's Lois. That's
her right there.

987
01:19:34,313 --> 01:19:36,815
Murphy stole Grandpa's car.

988
01:19:36,982 --> 01:19:40,051
She crashed it.
She's okay, though.

989
01:19:40,319 --> 01:19:41,803
Hey, Dad.

990
01:19:42,321 --> 01:19:43,955
Look at this!

991
01:19:44,489 --> 01:19:46,291
You're a grandpa.

992
01:19:47,409 --> 01:19:49,377
His name's Jesse.

993
01:19:49,745 --> 01:19:54,900
I kind of wanted to call him Coop,
but Lois says, uh... maybe next time.

994
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:59,521
Donald says he's already earned the "great"
part, so we just leave it at that.

995
01:20:02,591 --> 01:20:04,484
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

996
01:20:05,177 --> 01:20:09,114
Say "Bye-bye, Grandpa."
Bye-bye, Grandpa. Okay.

997
01:20:09,431 --> 01:20:12,033
Sorry it's been a while.

998
01:20:13,310 --> 01:20:14,953
Just...

999
01:20:16,563 --> 01:20:18,965
what with Jesse and all.

1000
01:20:21,943 --> 01:20:23,545
Uh...

1001
01:20:25,072 --> 01:20:27,707
Grandpa died last week.

1002
01:20:27,824 --> 01:20:31,411
We buried him out in the back forty
next to Mom and...

1003
01:20:31,787 --> 01:20:33,471
Jesse.

1004
01:20:33,747 --> 01:20:37,333
Which is where we would have buried you
if you'd ever...

1005
01:20:37,584 --> 01:20:39,686
come back.

1006
01:20:40,587 --> 01:20:43,139
Murph was there at the funeral.

1007
01:20:43,465 --> 01:20:46,418
We don't see her that much,
but she came for that.

1008
01:20:49,429 --> 01:20:52,448
You aren't listening to this,
I know that.

1009
01:20:54,976 --> 01:20:57,829
All these messages
are just, like...

1010
01:20:58,897 --> 01:21:03,067
drifting out there
in the darkness.

1011
01:21:03,652 --> 01:21:06,087
Lois says that, uh...

1012
01:21:06,780 --> 01:21:09,808
I have to let you go.

1013
01:21:09,908 --> 01:21:11,843
And, uh...

1014
01:21:12,244 --> 01:21:13,928
So...

1015
01:21:16,581 --> 01:21:19,868
I guess I'm letting you go.

1016
01:21:20,627 --> 01:21:23,796
I don't know where
you are, Dad...

1017
01:21:23,922 --> 01:21:26,850
but I hope that you're at peace.

1018
01:21:28,343 --> 01:21:29,728
Goodbye.

1019
01:21:43,024 --> 01:21:44,676
Hey, Dad.

1020
01:21:47,112 --> 01:21:48,347
Hey, Murph.

1021
01:21:48,447 --> 01:21:50,865
You son of a bitch.

1022
01:21:54,077 --> 01:21:56,646
I never made one of these
when you were still responding...

1023
01:21:56,746 --> 01:21:59,382
because I was so mad
at you for leaving.

1024
01:22:02,127 --> 01:22:04,612
And then when you
went quiet, it...

1025
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:10,276
seemed like I should live with
that decision. And I have.

1026
01:22:14,181 --> 01:22:16,900
But today's my birthday.

1027
01:22:20,270 --> 01:22:23,940
And it's a special one,
because you told me...

1028
01:22:27,569 --> 01:22:32,207
You once told me that when you came back,
we might be the same age.

1029
01:22:33,617 --> 01:22:37,003
And today I'm the age you were
when you left.

1030
01:22:39,706 --> 01:22:41,858
So it would be a real good time
for you to come back.

1031
01:22:56,264 --> 01:23:00,660
I didn't mean to intrude. It's just that
I've never seen you in here before.

1032
01:23:01,186 --> 01:23:03,455
I've never been in here before.

1033
01:23:05,232 --> 01:23:10,470
I talk to Amelia
all the time. It helps.

1034
01:23:10,737 --> 01:23:13,557
- I'm glad you've started.
- I haven't. I...

1035
01:23:13,657 --> 01:23:16,259
I just had something
I needed to get out.

1036
01:23:16,493 --> 01:23:18,979
- I know they're still out there.
- I know.

1037
01:23:19,079 --> 01:23:23,358
There are so many reasons their
communications might not be getting through.

1038
01:23:23,458 --> 01:23:24,976
I know, professor.

1039
01:23:25,502 --> 01:23:28,521
I'm not sure what
I'm more afraid of.

1040
01:23:29,589 --> 01:23:32,425
Them never coming back or...

1041
01:23:33,134 --> 01:23:36,413
coming back to
find we've failed.

1042
01:23:36,513 --> 01:23:38,031
Then let's succeed.

1043
01:23:38,974 --> 01:23:40,516
So...

1044
01:23:40,725 --> 01:23:44,963
back to the fourth iteration.
Let's run it through some new fields.

1045
01:23:45,063 --> 01:23:48,467
With respect, professor,
we've tried that hundreds of times.

1046
01:23:48,567 --> 01:23:52,737
It only has to work once, Murph.

1047
01:23:55,532 --> 01:23:59,478
Every rivet that they strike
could have been a bullet.

1048
01:23:59,578 --> 01:24:01,646
We've done well for
the world here...

1049
01:24:01,746 --> 01:24:06,568
whether or not we crack the equation
before I kick the bucket.

1050
01:24:06,668 --> 01:24:09,646
- Don't be morbid, professor.
- I'm not afraid of death.

1051
01:24:10,297 --> 01:24:12,632
I'm an old physicist.

1052
01:24:13,383 --> 01:24:15,151
I'm afraid of time.

1053
01:24:22,225 --> 01:24:23,493
Time.

1054
01:24:25,437 --> 01:24:27,205
You're afraid of time.

1055
01:24:29,691 --> 01:24:31,760
We've been trying
to solve the equation...

1056
01:24:31,860 --> 01:24:34,429
without changing
the underlying assumption about time.

1057
01:24:34,529 --> 01:24:36,306
- And?
- And that means...

1058
01:24:36,406 --> 01:24:40,936
each iteration is an attempt
to prove its own proof.

1059
01:24:41,036 --> 01:24:43,355
It's recursive.
It's nonsensical.

1060
01:24:43,455 --> 01:24:47,317
Are you calling my life's work...
nonsense, Murph?

1061
01:24:47,417 --> 01:24:49,328
No, I'm saying
that you've been trying to...

1062
01:24:49,428 --> 01:24:53,723
finish it with one arm...
No, with both arms tied behind your back.

1063
01:24:55,508 --> 01:24:57,910
And I don't understand why.

1064
01:24:58,470 --> 01:25:00,705
I'm an old man, Murph.

1065
01:25:01,222 --> 01:25:03,917
Can we take this point up
at another time?

1066
01:25:04,017 --> 01:25:06,444
I want to talk to my daughter.

1067
01:25:08,313 --> 01:25:10,840
Stepping out into the universe...

1068
01:25:10,940 --> 01:25:14,836
we must confront the reality
of interstellar travel.

1069
01:25:15,654 --> 01:25:20,267
We must reach far beyond
our own lifespans.

1070
01:25:20,367 --> 01:25:25,897
We must think not as individuals
but as a species.

1071
01:25:28,333 --> 01:25:31,660
Do not go gentle
into that good night.

1072
01:25:33,129 --> 01:25:35,782
TARS kept the Endurance
right where we needed her.

1073
01:25:35,882 --> 01:25:38,777
But the trip took years longer
than we anticipated.

1074
01:25:39,010 --> 01:25:42,614
We no longer have the fuel
to visit both prospects, so...

1075
01:25:42,847 --> 01:25:44,649
we have to choose.

1076
01:25:45,558 --> 01:25:46,985
But how?

1077
01:25:47,727 --> 01:25:49,696
They're both promising.

1078
01:25:50,939 --> 01:25:55,510
Edmunds' data is better, but Dr. Mann
is the one still transmitting, so...

1079
01:25:55,610 --> 01:25:58,830
We've no reason to suspect
Edmunds's data would have soured.

1080
01:25:59,447 --> 01:26:02,017
His world has key elements
to sustain human life.

1081
01:26:02,117 --> 01:26:05,586
- As does Dr. Mann's.
- Cooper, this is my field.

1082
01:26:06,454 --> 01:26:07,797
And...

1083
01:26:08,289 --> 01:26:10,525
I really believe Edmunds'
is the better prospect.

1084
01:26:10,625 --> 01:26:14,262
- Why?
- Gargantua, that's why.

1085
01:26:15,088 --> 01:26:19,200
Look at Miller's planet.
Hydrocarbons, organics, yes...

1086
01:26:19,300 --> 01:26:24,022
but no life. Sterile.
We'll find the same thing on Mann's.

1087
01:26:24,139 --> 01:26:25,999
Because of the black hole?

1088
01:26:26,099 --> 01:26:29,210
Murphy's Law.
Whatever can happen will happen.

1089
01:26:29,310 --> 01:26:31,713
Accident is the first building block
of evolution.

1090
01:26:31,813 --> 01:26:34,716
But when you're orbiting a black hole
not enough can happen.

1091
01:26:34,816 --> 01:26:39,387
It sucks in asteroids and comets, other
events which would otherwise reach you.

1092
01:26:39,487 --> 01:26:41,622
We need to go further afield.

1093
01:26:41,948 --> 01:26:44,584
You once said that Dr. Mann...

1094
01:26:45,535 --> 01:26:47,228
was the best of us.

1095
01:26:47,328 --> 01:26:50,798
He's remarkable.
We're only here because of him.

1096
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:52,942
And yet... Yet here he is.

1097
01:26:53,042 --> 01:26:57,328
He's on the ground, and he's sending
a very unambiguous message,

1098
01:26:57,428 --> 01:26:59,949
telling us to come
to his planet.

1099
01:27:00,049 --> 01:27:04,979
Granted, but Edmunds' data
is more promising.

1100
01:27:05,138 --> 01:27:06,247
We should vote.

1101
01:27:06,347 --> 01:27:08,816
Well, if we vote,
there's something you should know.

1102
01:27:09,642 --> 01:27:12,820
Brand? He has a right to know.

1103
01:27:13,021 --> 01:27:14,839
That has nothing to do with it.

1104
01:27:14,939 --> 01:27:18,051
- What does?
- She's in love with Wolf Edmunds.

1105
01:27:18,151 --> 01:27:21,195
- Is that true?
- Yes.

1106
01:27:23,865 --> 01:27:26,876
And that makes me
want to follow my heart.

1107
01:27:30,038 --> 01:27:33,775
But maybe we've spent too long trying
to figure all this out with theory.

1108
01:27:33,875 --> 01:27:35,360
You're a scientist, Brand.

1109
01:27:35,460 --> 01:27:37,303
So listen to me...

1110
01:27:37,837 --> 01:27:42,850
when I say that love
isn't something we invented. It's...

1111
01:27:43,551 --> 01:27:46,187
observable, powerful.

1112
01:27:47,972 --> 01:27:49,649
It has to mean something.

1113
01:27:49,749 --> 01:27:54,095
Love has meaning, yes. Social utility,
social bonding, child rearing...

1114
01:27:54,195 --> 01:27:57,999
We love people who have died.
Where's the social utility in that?

1115
01:27:58,441 --> 01:27:59,551
None.

1116
01:27:59,651 --> 01:28:03,596
Maybe it means something more,
something we can't...

1117
01:28:03,696 --> 01:28:05,807
yet understand.

1118
01:28:05,907 --> 01:28:09,669
Maybe it's some
evidence, some...

1119
01:28:10,328 --> 01:28:14,858
artifact of a higher dimension
that we can't consciously perceive.

1120
01:28:14,958 --> 01:28:19,821
I'm drawn across the universe
to someone I haven't seen in a decade...

1121
01:28:19,921 --> 01:28:22,991
who I know is probably dead.

1122
01:28:23,091 --> 01:28:26,494
Love is the one thing
we're capable of perceiving...

1123
01:28:26,594 --> 01:28:29,730
that transcends dimensions
of time and space.

1124
01:28:31,266 --> 01:28:35,903
Maybe we should trust that,
even if we can't understand it yet.

1125
01:28:40,608 --> 01:28:42,577
All right, Cooper...

1126
01:28:44,153 --> 01:28:45,746
yes...

1127
01:28:46,614 --> 01:28:50,151
the tiniest possibility
of seeing Wolf again excites me.

1128
01:28:50,785 --> 01:28:52,753
That doesn't mean I'm wrong.

1129
01:28:53,162 --> 01:28:55,631
Honestly, Amelia...

1130
01:28:57,125 --> 01:28:58,393
it might.

1131
01:29:05,091 --> 01:29:08,102
TARS, chart a course for
Dr. Mann's.

1132
01:29:24,894 --> 01:29:28,164
We'll lose about a third again.
But next year...

1133
01:29:30,158 --> 01:29:33,094
Next year I'm gonna work Nelson's farm
and we'll make it up.

1134
01:29:33,828 --> 01:29:35,963
What happened to Nelson?

1135
01:29:41,586 --> 01:29:43,863
Murph, have you eaten enough?
Would you like some more souffle?

1136
01:29:43,963 --> 01:29:47,642
Oh, no. I'm full, thanks.
It was delicious.

1137
01:29:48,217 --> 01:29:50,519
Coop, finish your
fritter, please.

1138
01:29:52,388 --> 01:29:56,167
Will you spend the night? Your room
is exactly as you left it. It's ready.

1139
01:29:56,267 --> 01:29:57,710
I need to get back.

1140
01:29:57,810 --> 01:29:59,621
My sewing machine is in there,
but there's plenty...

1141
01:29:59,721 --> 01:30:02,114
I need to...

1142
01:30:04,692 --> 01:30:06,735
Too many memories.

1143
01:30:06,861 --> 01:30:09,756
We might have something for that.
Hey, Coop.

1144
01:30:17,205 --> 01:30:18,598
The dust.

1145
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,444
Lois, I have a friend who...

1146
01:30:23,844 --> 01:30:25,680
could look at his lungs.

1147
01:30:43,564 --> 01:30:46,301
- Amelia, I'm sorry.
- You were just being objective.

1148
01:30:46,401 --> 01:30:49,929
Unless you're punishing me
for screwing up on Miller's planet.

1149
01:30:50,029 --> 01:30:52,581
No, this wasn't a
personal decision.

1150
01:30:53,116 --> 01:30:57,228
If you're wrong, you will have
a very personal decision to make.

1151
01:30:57,328 --> 01:31:00,523
Your fuel calculations
are based on a return journey.

1152
01:31:00,623 --> 01:31:04,694
Strike out on Mann's planet, and we'll have
to decide whether to return home...

1153
01:31:04,794 --> 01:31:07,155
or push on to
Edmunds' with Plan B.

1154
01:31:07,255 --> 01:31:11,159
Starting a colony could save us
from extinction.

1155
01:31:11,259 --> 01:31:14,495
You might have to decide
between seeing your children again...

1156
01:31:14,595 --> 01:31:16,531
and the future of
the human race.

1157
01:31:17,732 --> 01:31:19,742
I trust you'll be
as objective then.

1158
01:31:26,524 --> 01:31:28,509
He's been asking for you
since he came to.

1159
01:31:28,609 --> 01:31:30,336
We were trying to reach you.

1160
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:37,543
Murph.

1161
01:31:38,244 --> 01:31:40,046
I'm here, professor.

1162
01:31:40,455 --> 01:31:42,824
I let you all down.

1163
01:31:43,124 --> 01:31:46,761
No, you got us so far.
Real close.

1164
01:31:48,296 --> 01:31:50,156
I'll finish what you started.

1165
01:31:50,256 --> 01:31:52,767
Good, good Murph.

1166
01:31:54,761 --> 01:31:57,355
You had faith...

1167
01:31:58,264 --> 01:31:59,857
all those...

1168
01:32:00,516 --> 01:32:02,610
all those years.

1169
01:32:03,978 --> 01:32:05,296
I...

1170
01:32:05,396 --> 01:32:08,199
I asked you to have faith.

1171
01:32:09,650 --> 01:32:12,745
I wanted you to believe...

1172
01:32:13,946 --> 01:32:16,123
that your father...

1173
01:32:18,826 --> 01:32:20,728
would come back.

1174
01:32:20,828 --> 01:32:22,121
I do, professor.

1175
01:32:23,748 --> 01:32:28,002
- Forgive me, Murph.
- There's nothing to forgive.

1176
01:32:31,071 --> 01:32:34,433
I... I lied, Murph.

1177
01:32:36,511 --> 01:32:38,604
I lied to you.

1178
01:32:44,644 --> 01:32:47,955
There was no need for him to...

1179
01:32:49,065 --> 01:32:51,242
To come back.

1180
01:32:53,528 --> 01:32:57,164
There is no way to help us.

1181
01:32:58,157 --> 01:32:59,500
But Plan A...

1182
01:32:59,742 --> 01:33:03,170
All this. All these people.

1183
01:33:03,996 --> 01:33:06,091
And the equation.

1184
01:33:09,794 --> 01:33:11,646
Did my father know?

1185
01:33:15,341 --> 01:33:17,551
Did he leave me?

1186
01:33:21,013 --> 01:33:22,356
Do...

1187
01:33:23,224 --> 01:33:24,859
not...

1188
01:33:25,518 --> 01:33:27,069
go...

1189
01:33:27,979 --> 01:33:30,064
gentle...

1190
01:33:31,566 --> 01:33:33,033
No.

1191
01:33:34,402 --> 01:33:35,986
No!

1192
01:33:36,696 --> 01:33:38,639
You can't leave.

1193
01:33:38,739 --> 01:33:40,291
You... No.

1194
01:33:41,075 --> 01:33:46,046
Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you that
your father died today. He had no pain.

1195
01:33:46,230 --> 01:33:48,399
He was at peace.

1196
01:33:48,666 --> 01:33:51,051
I'm very sorry for your loss.

1197
01:34:03,347 --> 01:34:05,116
Brand, did you know?

1198
01:34:07,435 --> 01:34:09,403
He told you, right?

1199
01:34:11,981 --> 01:34:13,857
You knew.

1200
01:34:15,276 --> 01:34:17,369
This was all a sham.

1201
01:34:21,449 --> 01:34:23,634
You left us here.

1202
01:34:25,286 --> 01:34:27,087
To suffocate.

1203
01:34:28,956 --> 01:34:30,591
To starve.

1204
01:34:57,652 --> 01:34:59,086
Frozen cloud.

1205
01:37:23,422 --> 01:37:26,684
It's okay. It's okay.

1206
01:37:33,224 --> 01:37:35,025
It's okay.

1207
01:37:40,147 --> 01:37:42,449
Pray you never learn...

1208
01:37:43,317 --> 01:37:46,954
just how good it can be
to see another face.

1209
01:37:55,079 --> 01:37:57,648
I hadn't a lot of hope
to begin with, but...

1210
01:37:57,748 --> 01:38:00,384
after so long, I had none.

1211
01:38:01,552 --> 01:38:04,888
My supplies were
completely exhausted.

1212
01:38:06,549 --> 01:38:10,602
The last time I went to sleep,
I didn't even set a waking date.

1213
01:38:14,014 --> 01:38:16,900
You have literally raised me
from the dead.

1214
01:38:17,643 --> 01:38:19,893
- Lazarus.
- Hm.

1215
01:38:20,729 --> 01:38:24,283
- What about the others?
- I'm afraid you're it, sir.

1216
01:38:24,692 --> 01:38:27,411
So far, surely.

1217
01:38:27,862 --> 01:38:32,800
No, our present situation is that there's
very little chance of rescuing any others.

1218
01:38:36,454 --> 01:38:38,964
Dr. Mann. Dr. Mann?

1219
01:38:39,540 --> 01:38:41,433
Tell us about your world.

1220
01:38:44,712 --> 01:38:46,655
Our world, we hope.

1221
01:38:50,384 --> 01:38:52,787
Our world, uh... is cold...

1222
01:38:52,887 --> 01:38:54,680
stark...

1223
01:38:56,056 --> 01:38:58,192
but undeniably beautiful.

1224
01:39:00,144 --> 01:39:03,697
The days are 67 hours long, cold.

1225
01:39:07,601 --> 01:39:09,220
The nights are...

1226
01:39:09,320 --> 01:39:12,155
67 far colder hours.

1227
01:39:17,495 --> 01:39:21,899
The gravity is a very, very pleasant
80 percent of the Earth's.

1228
01:39:21,999 --> 01:39:25,236
Now, up here where I landed,
the water is alkali...

1229
01:39:25,336 --> 01:39:29,156
and the air has too much ammonia to breathe
for more than just a few minutes...

1230
01:39:29,256 --> 01:39:33,911
but down at the surface,
and there is a surface...

1231
01:39:34,011 --> 01:39:35,703
the chlorine dissipates.

1232
01:39:35,804 --> 01:39:39,917
The ammonia gives way to crystalline
hydrocarbons and breathable air.

1233
01:39:40,017 --> 01:39:44,288
To organics. Possibly
even to life.

1234
01:39:45,022 --> 01:39:47,241
We might be sharing this world.

1235
01:39:47,483 --> 01:39:49,310
These readings are
from the surface?

1236
01:39:49,410 --> 01:39:53,013
Over the years,
I've dropped various probes.

1237
01:39:53,113 --> 01:39:56,600
- How far have you explored?
- I've mounted several major expeditions.

1238
01:39:56,700 --> 01:40:00,821
But with oxygen in limited supply,
KIPP there really did most of the legwork.

1239
01:40:00,921 --> 01:40:03,649
- What went wrong with him, sir?
- Degeneration.

1240
01:40:03,749 --> 01:40:07,403
He misidentified the first organics
we found as ammonia crystals.

1241
01:40:07,503 --> 01:40:11,699
We struggled on for a time,
but ultimately I decommissioned him and...

1242
01:40:11,799 --> 01:40:14,034
used his power source
to keep the mission going.

1243
01:40:14,134 --> 01:40:17,204
I thought I was alone
before I shut him down.

1244
01:40:17,304 --> 01:40:19,273
Would you like me
to look at him?

1245
01:40:19,473 --> 01:40:21,709
No. No. He needs a human touch.

1246
01:40:21,809 --> 01:40:26,380
Dr. Brand, CASE is relaying a message
for you from the comm station.

1247
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:29,241
Okay. Be right there.
Excuse me.

1248
01:40:40,953 --> 01:40:43,639
Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you
that your father died today.

1249
01:40:44,248 --> 01:40:46,374
He had no pain.

1250
01:40:49,003 --> 01:40:50,804
He was at peace.

1251
01:40:52,590 --> 01:40:54,725
I'm sorry for your loss.

1252
01:40:56,802 --> 01:40:58,145
Is that Murph?

1253
01:40:58,554 --> 01:41:01,081
She's... She's grown.

1254
01:41:01,181 --> 01:41:03,266
Brand, did you know?

1255
01:41:03,934 --> 01:41:06,103
He told you, right?

1256
01:41:08,647 --> 01:41:10,240
You knew.

1257
01:41:11,692 --> 01:41:13,293
This was all a sham.

1258
01:41:14,236 --> 01:41:16,404
You left us here.

1259
01:41:18,032 --> 01:41:19,833
To suffocate.

1260
01:41:21,619 --> 01:41:23,295
To starve.

1261
01:41:26,332 --> 01:41:28,116
Did my father know too?

1262
01:41:30,502 --> 01:41:32,262
Dad?

1263
01:41:33,714 --> 01:41:35,933
I just want to know...

1264
01:41:36,967 --> 01:41:39,169
if you left me here to die.

1265
01:41:41,555 --> 01:41:43,857
I just have to know.

1266
01:41:49,063 --> 01:41:50,781
Cooper, my...

1267
01:41:51,982 --> 01:41:54,176
My father dedicated...

1268
01:41:54,276 --> 01:41:59,781
his whole life to Plan A.
I have no idea what she's talking about.

1269
01:42:01,091 --> 01:42:02,659
I do.

1270
01:42:07,289 --> 01:42:10,258
He never even hoped
to get the people off the Earth?

1271
01:42:11,168 --> 01:42:12,678
No.

1272
01:42:16,423 --> 01:42:20,560
But he's been trying to solve
the gravity equation for 40 years.

1273
01:42:20,761 --> 01:42:24,481
Amelia, your father solved his equation
before I even left.

1274
01:42:24,765 --> 01:42:26,709
Then why wouldn't he use it?

1275
01:42:26,809 --> 01:42:30,838
The equation couldn't reconcile relativity
with quantum mechanics. You need more.

1276
01:42:30,938 --> 01:42:32,923
More? More what?

1277
01:42:33,023 --> 01:42:36,093
More data.
You need to see into a black hole.

1278
01:42:36,193 --> 01:42:38,345
The laws of nature prohibit
a naked singularity.

1279
01:42:38,445 --> 01:42:40,247
Romilly, is that true?

1280
01:42:41,240 --> 01:42:45,019
If a black hole is an oyster,
then the singularity's the pearl inside.

1281
01:42:45,119 --> 01:42:49,956
The gravity's so strong, it's always
hidden in darkness... behind the horizon.

1282
01:42:50,874 --> 01:42:53,027
That's why we call
it a black hole.

1283
01:42:53,127 --> 01:42:56,847
Okay, but if we see
beyond the horizon...

1284
01:42:57,131 --> 01:42:58,699
We can't, Coop.

1285
01:42:58,799 --> 01:43:01,535
There are some things
that aren't meant to be known.

1286
01:43:01,635 --> 01:43:05,748
Your father had to find another way
to save the human race from extinction.

1287
01:43:05,848 --> 01:43:09,484
- Plan B. A colony.
- Why not tell people?

1288
01:43:10,769 --> 01:43:13,922
- Why keep building those stations?
- He knew how hard it would be...

1289
01:43:14,022 --> 01:43:18,218
to get people to work together to save
the species instead of themselves.

1290
01:43:18,518 --> 01:43:20,763
- Or their children.
- Bullshit.

1291
01:43:20,863 --> 01:43:23,823
You never would've come here
unless you believed you would save them.

1292
01:43:23,824 --> 01:43:26,702
Evolution has yet to transcend
that simple barrier.

1293
01:43:26,802 --> 01:43:30,694
We can care deeply,
selflessly about those we know,

1294
01:43:30,794 --> 01:43:33,400
but that empathy rarely extends
beyond our line of sight.

1295
01:43:33,500 --> 01:43:35,510
But the lie.

1296
01:43:38,505 --> 01:43:41,124
That monstrous lie?

1297
01:43:42,176 --> 01:43:45,395
Unforgivable.
And he knew that.

1298
01:43:45,846 --> 01:43:50,250
He was prepared to destroy his own humanity
in order to save the species.

1299
01:43:50,350 --> 01:43:53,070
- He made an incredible sacrifice.
- No.

1300
01:43:54,188 --> 01:43:59,167
An incredible sacrifice is being made
by the people on Earth who are gonna die!

1301
01:43:59,526 --> 01:44:01,795
Because in his
fucking arrogance...

1302
01:44:02,112 --> 01:44:04,298
he declared their case hopeless.

1303
01:44:04,865 --> 01:44:08,435
I'm sorry, Cooper...
their case is hopeless.

1304
01:44:08,535 --> 01:44:10,962
No. No.

1305
01:44:11,288 --> 01:44:12,890
We are the future.

1306
01:44:16,460 --> 01:44:18,678
Cooper, what can I do?

1307
01:44:21,590 --> 01:44:23,525
Let me go home.

1308
01:44:24,009 --> 01:44:26,028
You're absolutely positive?

1309
01:44:26,553 --> 01:44:29,156
His solution was correct.
He'd had it for years.

1310
01:44:29,723 --> 01:44:32,451
- It's worthless?
- It's half the answer.

1311
01:44:33,310 --> 01:44:36,413
Okay, how do you
find the other half?

1312
01:44:36,897 --> 01:44:38,632
Out there? A black hole.

1313
01:44:38,732 --> 01:44:41,868
- But stuck down here on Earth?
- Yeah?

1314
01:44:42,903 --> 01:44:44,871
I'm not sure you can.

1315
01:44:46,490 --> 01:44:49,459
God, they just pack up and leave.

1316
01:44:50,577 --> 01:44:52,963
What are they hoping to find?

1317
01:44:53,247 --> 01:44:54,589
Survival.

1318
01:45:02,089 --> 01:45:03,473
Damn it.

1319
01:45:06,093 --> 01:45:09,988
Murph, don't...?
Don't people have a right to know?

1320
01:45:10,514 --> 01:45:14,668
Panic won't help. We just
have to keep working, same as ever.

1321
01:45:14,768 --> 01:45:18,172
But isn't that exactly what Professor Brand
was manipulating us to do?

1322
01:45:18,272 --> 01:45:21,625
Brand gave up on us.
I'm still trying to solve this.

1323
01:45:22,150 --> 01:45:23,735
So...

1324
01:45:24,653 --> 01:45:26,622
do you have an idea?

1325
01:45:27,030 --> 01:45:28,665
A feeling.

1326
01:45:31,785 --> 01:45:34,087
I told you about my ghost.

1327
01:45:35,789 --> 01:45:38,092
My dad thought I
called it a ghost...

1328
01:45:38,192 --> 01:45:40,260
because I was scared of it.

1329
01:45:43,422 --> 01:45:45,755
But I was never scared of it.

1330
01:45:46,967 --> 01:45:49,936
I called it a ghost
because it felt...

1331
01:45:52,055 --> 01:45:54,024
It felt like a person.

1332
01:45:56,268 --> 01:45:58,236
It was trying to
tell me something.

1333
01:46:00,898 --> 01:46:04,001
If there's an answer here on Earth,
it's back there...

1334
01:46:04,359 --> 01:46:08,872
somehow, in that room.
So I have to find it.

1335
01:46:11,992 --> 01:46:14,044
We're running out of time.

1336
01:46:15,662 --> 01:46:17,731
What about auxiliary oxygen scrubbers?

1337
01:46:17,831 --> 01:46:20,067
No, they can stay.
I'll be sleeping anyway.

1338
01:46:20,167 --> 01:46:21,819
- Hey, Coop?
- Yeah?

1339
01:46:21,919 --> 01:46:23,987
I have a suggestion
for your return journey.

1340
01:46:24,087 --> 01:46:26,940
- Yeah, what's that?
- Have one last crack at the black hole.

1341
01:46:28,717 --> 01:46:30,169
I'm going home, Rom.

1342
01:46:30,269 --> 01:46:34,022
Yeah, I know.
This isn't going to cost you any time.

1343
01:46:34,473 --> 01:46:36,508
There's a chance for
the people on Earth.

1344
01:46:37,059 --> 01:46:40,170
- Talk to me.
- Gargantua's an older spinning black hole.

1345
01:46:40,270 --> 01:46:44,216
- It's what we call a gentle singularity.
- Gentle?

1346
01:46:44,316 --> 01:46:47,845
They're hardly gentle.
But the tidal gravity is so quick that...

1347
01:46:47,945 --> 01:46:52,266
something crossing the horizon fast
might survive. A probe, say.

1348
01:46:52,366 --> 01:46:57,104
- What happens after it crosses?
- After the horizon is a complete mystery.

1349
01:46:57,204 --> 01:47:00,357
So, what's to say
there isn't some way that the probe...

1350
01:47:00,457 --> 01:47:03,443
can glimpse the singularity
and relay the quantum data?

1351
01:47:03,543 --> 01:47:06,864
If he's equipped to transmit
every form of energy that can pulse.

1352
01:47:06,964 --> 01:47:10,058
Just when did this probe
become a "he," professor?

1353
01:47:10,300 --> 01:47:12,352
TARS is the obvious candidate.

1354
01:47:12,886 --> 01:47:14,872
I've already told him
what to look for.

1355
01:47:14,972 --> 01:47:17,749
I'd need the old optical transmitter
off KIPP, Cooper.

1356
01:47:17,849 --> 01:47:19,251
You'd do this for us?

1357
01:47:19,351 --> 01:47:23,572
Before you get all teary, remember that
as a robot I have to do anything you say.

1358
01:47:24,189 --> 01:47:27,659
- Your cue light's broken.
- I'm not joking.

1359
01:47:29,987 --> 01:47:33,307
I'm gonna need TARS to remove and adapt
some components from KIPP.

1360
01:47:33,407 --> 01:47:35,809
I don't want to disturb
his archival functions.

1361
01:47:35,909 --> 01:47:37,644
I'll supervise.

1362
01:47:37,744 --> 01:47:38,854
All right.

1363
01:47:38,954 --> 01:47:43,692
Dr. Mann, we need to find three secure
sites. One for Brand's lab, two for habitat.

1364
01:47:43,792 --> 01:47:46,320
Once those modules have landed,
you don't want to move them.

1365
01:47:46,420 --> 01:47:49,031
I can take you to the probe sites,
but I don't think...

1366
01:47:49,131 --> 01:47:51,909
these conditions are gonna hold.
I think we should wait.

1367
01:47:52,009 --> 01:47:54,912
CASE is headed down
with the rest of the distillery equipment.

1368
01:47:55,012 --> 01:47:58,148
I'd really like to secure
those sites by nightfall.

1369
01:47:59,766 --> 01:48:03,153
Well, these squalls
do usually blow over.

1370
01:48:03,270 --> 01:48:04,463
Okay, then.

1371
01:48:04,563 --> 01:48:06,840
- You'll need a long-range transmitter.
- Got it.

1372
01:48:06,940 --> 01:48:08,783
- Are you charged?
- Yeah.

1373
01:48:09,067 --> 01:48:10,410
Follow me.

1374
01:48:10,902 --> 01:48:14,548
- TARS, 72 hours, yeah?
- Roger that, Cooper.

1375
01:48:20,746 --> 01:48:24,090
Brand told me why you feel
you have to go back.

1376
01:48:25,525 --> 01:48:28,612
But I'd be remiss
if I didn't at least mention...

1377
01:48:28,712 --> 01:48:32,983
that a mission such as ours
could certainly use an extra engineer.

1378
01:48:34,718 --> 01:48:39,072
You better slow down, turbo.
Safety first, CASE, remember.

1379
01:48:39,598 --> 01:48:41,650
Safety first, Cooper.

1380
01:48:42,601 --> 01:48:45,679
I have to tell you, Dr. Mann,
I'm honored to be a part of this.

1381
01:48:45,979 --> 01:48:51,285
But once we set up base camp and secure
those modules, my work's done here.

1382
01:48:51,401 --> 01:48:52,736
I'm going home.

1383
01:49:00,744 --> 01:49:03,904
You have attachments.
But even without a family...

1384
01:49:04,004 --> 01:49:09,427
I can promise you that that yearning
to be with other people is powerful.

1385
01:49:09,795 --> 01:49:13,431
That emotion is at
the foundation...

1386
01:49:13,799 --> 01:49:16,943
of what makes us human.
It's not to be taken lightly.

1387
01:49:24,851 --> 01:49:27,537
- How long have you had that cough?
- A while.

1388
01:49:37,989 --> 01:49:40,208
Mom lets me play in here.

1389
01:49:41,627 --> 01:49:43,378
I don't touch your stuff.

1390
01:50:14,067 --> 01:50:15,994
Just take this gently.

1391
01:50:20,824 --> 01:50:24,502
You know why we couldn't just send machines
on these missions, don't you, Cooper?

1392
01:50:24,828 --> 01:50:29,557
A machine doesn't improvise well
because you can't program a fear of death.

1393
01:50:30,333 --> 01:50:34,652
Our survival instinct is our single
greatest source of inspiration.

1394
01:50:34,766 --> 01:50:36,681
Take you, for example.

1395
01:50:37,090 --> 01:50:38,725
A father...

1396
01:50:38,925 --> 01:50:42,228
with a survival instinct
that extends to your kids.

1397
01:50:43,096 --> 01:50:48,067
What does research tell us is the last
thing you're going to see before you die?

1398
01:50:49,477 --> 01:50:52,172
Your children. Their faces.

1399
01:50:52,272 --> 01:50:57,035
At the moment of death, your mind's
gonna push a little bit harder to survive.

1400
01:50:57,444 --> 01:50:58,986
For them.

1401
01:50:59,362 --> 01:51:00,914
Deep breath.

1402
01:51:02,908 --> 01:51:06,853
Uh, hey. I bet you're Coop.
Why don't you have a seat here for me?

1403
01:51:06,953 --> 01:51:09,589
It's bad.
They cannot stay here.

1404
01:51:09,998 --> 01:51:11,391
- Okay?
- Yeah.

1405
01:51:19,633 --> 01:51:21,159
TARS, what's taking so long?

1406
01:51:21,259 --> 01:51:24,204
Professor, I am having trouble
completing the boot up.

1407
01:51:24,304 --> 01:51:26,047
I don't understand.

1408
01:51:32,646 --> 01:51:34,197
It's funny.

1409
01:51:35,982 --> 01:51:37,909
When I left Earth...

1410
01:51:38,610 --> 01:51:40,995
I thought I was prepared to die.

1411
01:51:42,739 --> 01:51:44,574
The truth is...

1412
01:51:46,284 --> 01:51:51,589
I never really considered the possibility
that my planet wasn't the one.

1413
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,403
Nothing worked out the way
it was supposed to.

1414
01:51:56,503 --> 01:51:58,045
Let's go.

1415
01:52:06,012 --> 01:52:08,907
All right, buddy,
give me a big deep breath.

1416
01:52:13,603 --> 01:52:15,121
What is this?

1417
01:52:15,438 --> 01:52:19,509
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry! I can't let you leave with that ship.

1418
01:52:19,609 --> 01:52:22,179
We're gonna need it
to complete the mission...

1419
01:52:22,279 --> 01:52:25,891
once the others realize
what this place isn't.

1420
01:52:25,991 --> 01:52:30,312
We cannot survive here.
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1421
01:52:40,005 --> 01:52:43,200
- They can't stay here anymore.
- You have to leave right now.

1422
01:52:43,300 --> 01:52:46,912
Let me make something abundantly clear.
You have a responsibility...

1423
01:52:47,012 --> 01:52:50,273
- Oh! Jesus!
- Coop, get her stuff. She's going home.

1424
01:52:50,473 --> 01:52:52,459
Dad didn't raise you
to be this dumb, Tom!

1425
01:52:52,559 --> 01:52:56,746
Dad didn't raise me, Grandpa did. And
he's buried out back with Mom and Jesse.

1426
01:52:57,230 --> 01:53:00,199
You faked all the data?

1427
01:53:01,609 --> 01:53:02,994
Yeah.

1428
01:53:06,698 --> 01:53:08,475
There's no surface?

1429
01:53:08,575 --> 01:53:10,043
No.

1430
01:53:10,702 --> 01:53:12,771
I tried to do my duty, Cooper...

1431
01:53:12,871 --> 01:53:18,176
but I knew the day that I arrived here
that this place had nothing.

1432
01:53:18,501 --> 01:53:22,597
And I resisted
the temptation for years...

1433
01:53:22,922 --> 01:53:25,242
but I knew that...

1434
01:53:25,342 --> 01:53:28,370
if I just pressed
that button, then...

1435
01:53:28,470 --> 01:53:30,572
somebody would come and save me.

1436
01:53:31,514 --> 01:53:33,116
You fucking coward.

1437
01:53:33,850 --> 01:53:34,993
Yes.

1438
01:53:40,315 --> 01:53:41,658
Yes.

1439
01:53:43,276 --> 01:53:44,619
Yes.

1440
01:53:45,570 --> 01:53:46,680
Yes.

1441
01:53:58,124 --> 01:54:02,770
Listen, if you're not going to go,
let your family go. Just save your family.

1442
01:54:03,171 --> 01:54:07,617
And we go live underground with you?
Pray that Daddy comes to save us?

1443
01:54:07,717 --> 01:54:11,691
Dad's not coming back.
He never was coming back. It's up to me.

1444
01:54:11,791 --> 01:54:14,704
You're gonna save everybody?
Because Dad couldn't do it.

1445
01:54:14,804 --> 01:54:19,112
Dad didn't even try!
Dad just abandoned us!

1446
01:54:19,562 --> 01:54:21,656
He left us here to die.

1447
01:54:22,065 --> 01:54:23,833
Nobody's going with you.

1448
01:54:27,445 --> 01:54:30,456
You gonna wait for
your next kid to die?

1449
01:54:33,159 --> 01:54:34,752
Get out.

1450
01:54:35,328 --> 01:54:36,963
And don't come back.

1451
01:54:41,543 --> 01:54:43,678
You can keep my stuff.

1452
01:54:54,305 --> 01:54:55,982
Stop it!

1453
01:54:58,685 --> 01:55:00,570
No. No!

1454
01:55:01,354 --> 01:55:04,532
Dr. Mann, there's a 50-50 chance
you're gonna kill yourself!

1455
01:55:05,066 --> 01:55:07,135
Those are the best odds
I've had in years.

1456
01:55:27,505 --> 01:55:29,640
Don't judge me, Cooper.

1457
01:55:30,091 --> 01:55:34,429
You were never tested like I was.
Few men have been.

1458
01:55:42,770 --> 01:55:44,238
You tried your best, Murph.

1459
01:55:53,448 --> 01:55:55,746
You're feeling it, aren't you?

1460
01:55:56,493 --> 01:55:58,628
The survival instinct.

1461
01:55:59,245 --> 01:56:03,683
That's what drove me. It's what drives
all of us. And it's what's gonna save us.

1462
01:56:04,751 --> 01:56:08,387
Because I want to save all of us.
For you, Cooper.

1463
01:56:13,259 --> 01:56:17,038
I'm sorry, I can't watch you
go through this. I'm sorry.

1464
01:56:17,138 --> 01:56:20,107
I thought I could, but I can't.

1465
01:56:20,892 --> 01:56:23,253
I'm here. I'm here for you.

1466
01:56:23,353 --> 01:56:25,696
Just listen to my voice, Cooper.

1467
01:56:26,189 --> 01:56:28,024
I'm right here.

1468
01:56:29,359 --> 01:56:30,993
You're not alone.

1469
01:56:40,411 --> 01:56:42,113
Do you see your children?

1470
01:56:45,166 --> 01:56:46,801
It's okay.

1471
01:56:47,460 --> 01:56:49,512
They're right there with you.

1472
01:56:53,091 --> 01:56:55,977
Did Professor Brand tell you
that poem before you left?

1473
01:56:56,511 --> 01:56:58,312
Do you remember?

1474
01:57:00,390 --> 01:57:03,659
Do not go gentle into that good night.

1475
01:57:04,978 --> 01:57:09,824
Old age should burn and rave
At close of day.

1476
01:57:11,109 --> 01:57:13,786
Rage, rage against
the dying of the light.

1477
01:57:38,136 --> 01:57:39,871
Brand! Help!

1478
01:57:39,971 --> 01:57:42,231
- Help!
- Cooper?

1479
01:57:48,646 --> 01:57:50,131
CASE!

1480
01:57:50,231 --> 01:57:51,824
No air.

1481
01:57:52,358 --> 01:57:53,868
Ammonia.

1482
01:57:54,652 --> 01:57:57,222
Cooper. Cooper, we're coming! CASE!

1483
01:57:57,322 --> 01:57:59,307
- I have a fix.
- Go! Go, go, go!

1484
01:57:59,407 --> 01:58:01,792
And away!

1485
01:58:13,046 --> 01:58:15,323
Cooper, we're coming.
Hang in there. Don't talk.

1486
01:58:15,423 --> 01:58:18,017
Try to breathe as little as possible.
We're almost there.

1487
01:58:21,487 --> 01:58:27,109
There's a security lockout, sir.
It requires a person to access function.

1488
01:58:31,856 --> 01:58:33,658
It's all yours, sir.

1489
01:58:41,674 --> 01:58:43,434
Try not to breathe.

1490
01:58:44,035 --> 01:58:48,064
We're coming. We're coming right now.
CASE, come on! Come on!

1491
01:58:48,164 --> 01:58:51,175
We got to go faster, CASE!
Faster, faster, faster!

1492
01:58:55,380 --> 01:58:57,390
Hang in there. Come on.

1493
01:59:03,596 --> 01:59:07,191
I see him, I see him!
CASE, bank! Bank right!

1494
01:59:25,910 --> 01:59:29,013
Cooper! Cooper! I'm here!

1495
01:59:52,145 --> 01:59:54,347
This data makes no sense.

1496
02:00:02,572 --> 02:00:04,057
I'm sorry.

1497
02:00:04,157 --> 02:00:07,043
- What?
- Mann was lying!

1498
02:00:14,500 --> 02:00:16,594
Go. Go.

1499
02:00:17,378 --> 02:00:18,696
Romilly.

1500
02:00:18,796 --> 02:00:20,073
Romilly!

1501
02:00:20,173 --> 02:00:22,892
Romilly!
Do you read me, Romilly?

1502
02:00:23,176 --> 02:00:25,278
Step back, professor! Step back!

1503
02:00:33,102 --> 02:00:35,988
- Romilly...
- Romilly, do you read me?

1504
02:00:38,691 --> 02:00:40,526
Keep watch!

1505
02:00:41,194 --> 02:00:42,420
Lois?

1506
02:00:42,820 --> 02:00:45,623
- What happened to caution, CASE?
- Safety first, Cooper.

1507
02:00:46,699 --> 02:00:50,419
Romilly? Romilly, do you read me?
This is Brand.

1508
02:00:52,997 --> 02:00:54,107
Romilly?

1509
02:00:54,207 --> 02:00:57,093
Dr. Brand. Cooper.
There's been an explosion.

1510
02:00:57,418 --> 02:00:59,512
Dr. Mann's compound.

1511
02:01:26,823 --> 02:01:29,166
TARS, TARS, 10 o'clock!

1512
02:01:35,248 --> 02:01:37,508
Let me know when TARS is aboard.

1513
02:01:40,837 --> 02:01:43,013
Romilly did not survive.

1514
02:01:43,923 --> 02:01:45,658
I could not save him.

1515
02:01:45,758 --> 02:01:47,319
- TARS is in.
- I'll take her now.

1516
02:01:47,385 --> 02:01:50,329
- Do we have a fix on the Ranger?
- He's pushing into orbit!

1517
02:01:50,429 --> 02:01:53,732
If he takes control
of that ship, we're dead.

1518
02:01:54,642 --> 02:01:57,903
- He'd maroon us?
- He is marooning us.

1519
02:01:59,605 --> 02:02:02,408
I'll meet you guys downstairs.
Go wait by the car.

1520
02:02:09,949 --> 02:02:14,461
Come on! Give me your bag. Get in the
backseat. Get in the backseat now!

1521
02:02:19,792 --> 02:02:22,011
Dr. Mann, please respond.

1522
02:02:22,336 --> 02:02:24,489
Dr. Mann, please respond!

1523
02:02:24,789 --> 02:02:26,909
He doesn't know
the Endurance docking procedure.

1524
02:02:26,966 --> 02:02:29,768
- The autopilot does.
- Not since TARS disabled it.

1525
02:02:30,678 --> 02:02:31,788
Nice.

1526
02:02:31,888 --> 02:02:35,107
- What's your trust setting, TARS?
- Lower than yours apparently.

1527
02:02:38,436 --> 02:02:42,048
Do not attempt docking.
I repeat, do not attempt docking.

1528
02:02:42,148 --> 02:02:43,257
Please res...

1529
02:03:42,625 --> 02:03:45,069
Auto-docking sequence withheld.

1530
02:03:45,169 --> 02:03:48,138
- Override.
- Unauthorized.

1531
02:03:48,547 --> 02:03:50,182
Override.

1532
02:03:50,383 --> 02:03:52,559
Unauthorized.

1533
02:03:56,389 --> 02:04:00,618
Do not attempt docking. I repeat,
do not attempt docking. Please resp...

1534
02:04:44,311 --> 02:04:46,580
Moving slowly toward
the Endurance.

1535
02:05:11,005 --> 02:05:12,657
Imperfect contact.

1536
02:05:12,757 --> 02:05:15,100
- Override.
- Hatch lockout.

1537
02:05:22,600 --> 02:05:25,444
- Is he locked on yet?
- Imperfectly.

1538
02:05:26,979 --> 02:05:28,297
Dr. Mann, do not...

1539
02:05:49,710 --> 02:05:53,013
Hatch lockout disengaged.

1540
02:06:01,263 --> 02:06:05,001
Dr. Mann, do not,
I repeat, do not open the hatch.

1541
02:06:05,101 --> 02:06:07,044
I repeat, do not open the hatch.

1542
02:06:07,144 --> 02:06:10,280
If you open the hatch,
the airlock will depressurize.

1543
02:06:35,881 --> 02:06:38,475
- What happens if he blows the airlock?
- Nothing good.

1544
02:06:44,056 --> 02:06:46,751
Okay, pull back. Retro thrusters,
everything we've got, CASE!

1545
02:06:46,851 --> 02:06:48,627
- Thrusters are full!
- Back!

1546
02:06:48,727 --> 02:06:50,796
Relay my transmission
to the onboard computer...

1547
02:06:50,896 --> 02:06:53,049
and have it rebroadcast
as emergency P.A.

1548
02:06:53,149 --> 02:06:54,491
Dr. Mann...

1549
02:06:56,777 --> 02:06:59,722
I repeat, do not open
the inner hatch. I repeat...

1550
02:06:59,822 --> 02:07:01,165
Brand?

1551
02:07:01,699 --> 02:07:03,809
I don't know what
he said to you...

1552
02:07:03,909 --> 02:07:06,879
but I am taking command
of the Endurance.

1553
02:07:07,037 --> 02:07:09,381
And then we can talk
about completing the mission.

1554
02:07:12,543 --> 02:07:14,353
Dr. Mann, listen to me.

1555
02:07:15,045 --> 02:07:17,347
This is not about my life.

1556
02:07:17,673 --> 02:07:21,226
Or Cooper's life.
This is about all mankind.

1557
02:07:21,510 --> 02:07:23,128
There is a moment...

1558
02:07:29,268 --> 02:07:30,703
It is not sa...

1559
02:07:38,903 --> 02:07:40,045
Oh, my God.

1560
02:07:58,255 --> 02:08:02,518
- There's no point using fuel to chase...
- Analyze the Endurance's spin.

1561
02:08:07,473 --> 02:08:09,983
- Cooper, what are you doing?
- Docking.

1562
02:08:14,271 --> 02:08:17,174
Endurance rotation is 67, 68 RPM.

1563
02:08:17,274 --> 02:08:19,802
Okay, get ready to match our spin
with the retro thrusters.

1564
02:08:19,902 --> 02:08:23,422
- It's not possible.
- No... it's necessary.

1565
02:08:34,959 --> 02:08:37,427
Endurance is hitting stratosphere!

1566
02:08:41,173 --> 02:08:43,517
She's got no heat shield.

1567
02:08:46,345 --> 02:08:48,197
- CASE, you ready?
- Ready.

1568
02:08:56,522 --> 02:08:59,992
Cooper! This is no time for caution.

1569
02:09:01,235 --> 02:09:03,762
CASE, if I black out,
you take the stick.

1570
02:09:03,862 --> 02:09:06,623
TARS, get ready to engage
the docking mechanism.

1571
02:09:13,372 --> 02:09:16,442
- Endurance is starting to heat.
- Twenty feet out.

1572
02:09:16,542 --> 02:09:19,111
I need three degrees starboard, Cooper.

1573
02:09:19,211 --> 02:09:21,280
Ten feet out.

1574
02:09:21,380 --> 02:09:23,949
Cooper, we are lined up.

1575
02:09:24,049 --> 02:09:25,734
Initiating spin!

1576
02:10:07,217 --> 02:10:08,527
Come on, TARS.

1577
02:10:16,685 --> 02:10:18,328
Come on, TARS!

1578
02:10:29,448 --> 02:10:32,167
- We are locked, Cooper.
- Locked. Easing up!

1579
02:10:39,750 --> 02:10:41,385
Easy.

1580
02:10:42,252 --> 02:10:43,887
Easy.

1581
02:10:49,426 --> 02:10:50,828
Retro thrusters!

1582
02:10:58,894 --> 02:11:00,696
Main engines on.

1583
02:11:06,151 --> 02:11:09,062
Pushing out of orbit.
Come on, baby.

1584
02:11:16,870 --> 02:11:18,839
Killing main engines!

1585
02:11:19,790 --> 02:11:21,758
Okay, we're out of orbit.

1586
02:11:28,799 --> 02:11:31,877
Okay. And for our next trick!

1587
02:11:33,512 --> 02:11:37,649
It'll have to be good.
We're heading into Gargantua's pull.

1588
02:11:38,267 --> 02:11:39,409
Oh, shit.

1589
02:11:39,810 --> 02:11:41,703
- CASE, take the stick.
- Roger that.

1590
02:12:31,570 --> 02:12:34,006
Cooper, we're slipping towards Gargantua.

1591
02:12:35,240 --> 02:12:37,267
Shall I use main engines?

1592
02:12:37,367 --> 02:12:41,546
No. We got to let her slide
as far as we can.

1593
02:12:50,047 --> 02:12:52,991
- Give it to me.
- There's good news, there's bad news.

1594
02:12:53,091 --> 02:12:56,820
Yeah, I've heard that one, TARS.
Give it to me straight.

1595
02:13:05,562 --> 02:13:08,841
The backup generator kicked in,
so the system's stable. They're all good.

1596
02:13:08,941 --> 02:13:10,283
Good.

1597
02:13:10,400 --> 02:13:13,804
Okay. The navigational hub
has been completely destroyed.

1598
02:13:13,904 --> 02:13:16,932
We don't have enough life support
to make it back to Earth, but...

1599
02:13:17,032 --> 02:13:19,184
I think we can scratch our way
to Edmunds' planet.

1600
02:13:19,284 --> 02:13:23,639
- What about fuel?
- Not enough. But I have a plan.

1601
02:13:24,164 --> 02:13:28,568
We let Gargantua pull us down
close to her horizon.

1602
02:13:28,669 --> 02:13:31,989
Then a powered slingshot around,
launching us towards Edmunds' planet.

1603
02:13:32,089 --> 02:13:34,658
- Manually?
- That's what I'm here for.

1604
02:13:34,758 --> 02:13:37,336
I'm gonna take us
just inside the critical orbit.

1605
02:13:37,436 --> 02:13:40,276
- What about time slippage?
- Neither of us has time to worry...

1606
02:13:40,305 --> 02:13:42,275
about relativity right now,
Dr. Brand.

1607
02:13:46,603 --> 02:13:48,205
I'm sorry, Cooper.

1608
02:13:51,233 --> 02:13:54,720
Once we've gathered
enough speed around Gargantua...

1609
02:13:54,820 --> 02:13:56,955
we use Lander 1...

1610
02:13:57,155 --> 02:13:59,749
and Ranger 2 as
rocket boosters to...

1611
02:14:00,317 --> 02:14:03,119
push us out of the
black hole's gravity.

1612
02:14:04,955 --> 02:14:07,691
The Lender's linkages
have been destroyed...

1613
02:14:07,791 --> 02:14:10,427
so we'll have to
control manually.

1614
02:14:11,336 --> 02:14:14,665
Once Lander 1 is spent,
TARS will detach...

1615
02:14:14,765 --> 02:14:16,875
And get sucked into that black hole.

1616
02:14:17,301 --> 02:14:18,928
Why does TARS have to detach?

1617
02:14:19,028 --> 02:14:21,538
We have to shed the weight
to escape the gravity.

1618
02:14:21,638 --> 02:14:23,081
Newton's third law.

1619
02:14:23,181 --> 02:14:25,959
The only way humans have ever
figured out of getting somewhere...

1620
02:14:26,059 --> 02:14:27,669
is to leave something behind.

1621
02:14:27,769 --> 02:14:30,880
Cooper, you can't ask TARS
to do this for us.

1622
02:14:30,981 --> 02:14:34,885
He's a robot. So you don't have
to ask him to do anything.

1623
02:14:34,985 --> 02:14:38,705
- Cooper, you asshole!
- Sorry, you broke up a little bit there.

1624
02:14:38,905 --> 02:14:41,391
It's what we intended, Dr. Brand.

1625
02:14:41,491 --> 02:14:44,019
It's our only chance
to save people on Earth.

1626
02:14:44,119 --> 02:14:47,397
If I can find a way to transmit
the quantum data I'll find in there...

1627
02:14:47,497 --> 02:14:49,633
they might still make it.

1628
02:14:50,576 --> 02:14:53,503
Let's just hope
there's still someone there to save.

1629
02:15:21,490 --> 02:15:23,458
Maximum velocity achieved.

1630
02:15:24,409 --> 02:15:26,979
Prepare to fire
escape thrusters.

1631
02:15:27,379 --> 02:15:29,815
- Ready?
- Ready.

1632
02:15:29,915 --> 02:15:33,110
- Ready.
- Main engine ignition in three...

1633
02:15:33,210 --> 02:15:34,678
two...

1634
02:15:35,003 --> 02:15:36,938
one. Mark.

1635
02:15:50,268 --> 02:15:51,820
Come on, baby.

1636
02:15:52,688 --> 02:15:55,090
Lander 1 engines, on my mark.

1637
02:15:55,644 --> 02:15:57,843
Three, two...

1638
02:15:57,943 --> 02:15:59,744
one. Mark.

1639
02:16:04,783 --> 02:16:07,436
Ranger 2 engines, on my mark.

1640
02:16:07,536 --> 02:16:10,213
Three, two, one...

1641
02:16:10,455 --> 02:16:11,923
- Mark.
- Fire!

1642
02:16:21,758 --> 02:16:25,228
This little maneuver's
gonna cost us 51 years!

1643
02:16:25,804 --> 02:16:28,606
You don't sound so
bad for pushing 120!

1644
02:16:43,697 --> 02:16:47,167
Lander 1, prepare to detach on my mark.

1645
02:16:47,534 --> 02:16:50,236
Three, two...

1646
02:16:51,063 --> 02:16:54,099
- one. Mark.
- Detach!

1647
02:16:57,169 --> 02:16:59,738
- Goodbye, TARS.
- Goodbye, Dr. Brand.

1648
02:16:59,838 --> 02:17:02,941
- See you on the other side, Coop.
- See you there, Slick!

1649
02:17:11,349 --> 02:17:13,234
Okay, CASE.

1650
02:17:13,677 --> 02:17:17,655
- Nice reckless flying!
- Learned from the master.

1651
02:17:17,814 --> 02:17:20,467
- Ranger 2, prepare to detach.
- What?

1652
02:17:20,567 --> 02:17:23,787
No! No! Cooper!
What are you doing?

1653
02:17:23,945 --> 02:17:27,724
Newton's third law.
You got to leave something behind.

1654
02:17:27,824 --> 02:17:30,310
You told me we had enough resources
for both of us.

1655
02:17:30,410 --> 02:17:32,437
We agreed, Amelia...

1656
02:17:32,537 --> 02:17:34,297
90 percent.

1657
02:17:35,874 --> 02:17:37,258
Don't.

1658
02:17:39,169 --> 02:17:40,637
Detach.

1659
02:17:53,433 --> 02:17:56,586
Okay, I am nosing down.

1660
02:17:59,981 --> 02:18:02,283
Approaching the event horizon.

1661
02:18:04,236 --> 02:18:09,040
Portside, dipping down beneath it
to go through it.

1662
02:18:10,325 --> 02:18:13,395
Heading towards blackness.

1663
02:18:13,495 --> 02:18:15,797
I have a visual of the event.

1664
02:18:15,997 --> 02:18:17,674
It's all black.

1665
02:18:19,701 --> 02:18:23,304
TARS, do you read me?
It's all blackness.

1666
02:18:25,006 --> 02:18:27,808
TARS! Do you read me? Over.

1667
02:18:31,847 --> 02:18:33,314
Okay.

1668
02:18:34,224 --> 02:18:35,775
Screens...

1669
02:18:37,102 --> 02:18:38,903
getting interference.

1670
02:18:40,313 --> 02:18:43,199
Losing control of the stick.
I got flashes.

1671
02:18:43,483 --> 02:18:45,952
Flashes of lightness
and blackness.

1672
02:18:46,862 --> 02:18:49,664
The turbulence in the gravity
is increasing.

1673
02:18:54,286 --> 02:18:55,837
Ah.

1674
02:18:56,037 --> 02:18:58,247
The computers are going down.
Agh.

1675
02:19:09,968 --> 02:19:13,104
Gravitational pull.
I'm losing control of the stick.

1676
02:19:46,171 --> 02:19:47,939
Murph? Murph, come on!

1677
02:19:53,511 --> 02:19:55,813
Eject. Eject.

1678
02:19:57,015 --> 02:19:58,399
Eject.

1679
02:19:58,516 --> 02:19:59,984
Eject.

1680
02:20:00,226 --> 02:20:01,569
Eject.

1681
02:20:01,978 --> 02:20:03,363
Eject.

1682
02:21:55,258 --> 02:21:56,601
Murph.

1683
02:22:06,269 --> 02:22:08,538
Murph! Murph! Murph!

1684
02:22:16,821 --> 02:22:18,164
Murph.

1685
02:22:25,080 --> 02:22:27,065
No, no, no!

1686
02:22:27,165 --> 02:22:28,525
Murph!

1687
02:22:28,625 --> 02:22:31,436
Murph! No! No!

1688
02:23:31,020 --> 02:23:33,081
If you're leaving, just go.

1689
02:23:33,481 --> 02:23:34,749
No, no. No.

1690
02:23:36,234 --> 02:23:38,636
No, don't go.
Don't go, you idiot.

1691
02:23:38,736 --> 02:23:40,329
Don't go!

1692
02:23:41,990 --> 02:23:43,958
Morse. Morse.

1693
02:23:44,409 --> 02:23:45,751
Morse.

1694
02:23:46,461 --> 02:23:48,521
Dot. Dot.

1695
02:23:48,621 --> 02:23:49,964
S.

1696
02:23:55,795 --> 02:23:57,138
T.

1697
02:24:01,426 --> 02:24:02,577
A.

1698
02:24:02,677 --> 02:24:03,961
Dash!

1699
02:24:06,556 --> 02:24:08,191
Dash! Dash!

1700
02:24:08,391 --> 02:24:09,501
Murph!

1701
02:24:09,601 --> 02:24:11,903
Murph, we don't have time for this!
Come on!

1702
02:24:12,020 --> 02:24:13,646
Y.

1703
02:24:18,643 --> 02:24:19,785
"Stay!"

1704
02:24:30,580 --> 02:24:33,216
Come on. Come on, Murph.
Come on!

1705
02:24:33,583 --> 02:24:35,676
What's it say?
What's it say, Murph?

1706
02:24:36,169 --> 02:24:37,753
What's it say?

1707
02:24:47,805 --> 02:24:49,232
"Stay."

1708
02:25:24,676 --> 02:25:27,812
Tell him, Murph.
Make him stay.

1709
02:25:31,231 --> 02:25:32,817
Make him stay, Murph.

1710
02:25:41,526 --> 02:25:43,703
Make him stay, Murph.

1711
02:25:44,862 --> 02:25:47,290
Don't let me leave, Murph!

1712
02:25:50,201 --> 02:25:52,920
Don't let me leave, Murph!

1713
02:25:58,518 --> 02:26:01,353
No! No! No!

1714
02:26:21,741 --> 02:26:23,542
It was you.

1715
02:26:34,412 --> 02:26:36,756
You were my ghost.

1716
02:26:46,174 --> 02:26:49,777
Cooper. Cooper. Come in, Cooper.

1717
02:26:50,970 --> 02:26:53,773
- TARS?
- Roger that.

1718
02:26:55,266 --> 02:26:58,194
- You survived.
- Somewhere...

1719
02:26:58,436 --> 02:27:00,546
in their fifth dimension.

1720
02:27:00,646 --> 02:27:03,049
They saved us.

1721
02:27:03,149 --> 02:27:08,429
Yeah? Who the hell is "they"?
And just why would they want to help us?

1722
02:27:08,529 --> 02:27:11,307
I don't know, but they constructed
this three-dimensional space...

1723
02:27:11,407 --> 02:27:14,769
inside their five-dimensional reality
to allow you to understand it.

1724
02:27:14,869 --> 02:27:16,896
Yeah, that ain't working.

1725
02:27:16,996 --> 02:27:18,606
Yes, it is.

1726
02:27:18,706 --> 02:27:22,652
You've seen that time is represented here
as a physical dimension.

1727
02:27:22,752 --> 02:27:25,888
You have worked out that you can exert
a force across space-time.

1728
02:27:26,255 --> 02:27:29,701
Gravity to send a message.

1729
02:27:30,001 --> 02:27:31,635
Affirmative.

1730
02:27:33,721 --> 02:27:35,347
Gravity...

1731
02:27:35,973 --> 02:27:39,544
can cross the dimensions,
including time.

1732
02:27:39,644 --> 02:27:41,237
Apparently.

1733
02:27:44,816 --> 02:27:47,118
Do you have the quantum data?

1734
02:27:47,235 --> 02:27:49,161
Roger. I have it.

1735
02:27:49,821 --> 02:27:53,891
I am transmitting it on all wavelengths,
but nothing is getting out, Cooper.

1736
02:27:53,991 --> 02:27:56,544
I can do this. I can do this.

1737
02:27:56,702 --> 02:27:59,522
But such complicated
data to a child?

1738
02:27:59,622 --> 02:28:00,815
Not just any child.

1739
02:28:00,915 --> 02:28:05,302
What else? Oh, come on, Dad.

1740
02:28:07,171 --> 02:28:09,407
Murph, the fire's out! Come on!

1741
02:28:09,507 --> 02:28:13,811
Even if you communicate it here, she won't
understand its significance for years.

1742
02:28:14,303 --> 02:28:15,830
I get that, TARS.

1743
02:28:15,930 --> 02:28:20,668
But we've got to figure something out or
the people on Earth are gonna die. Think!

1744
02:28:20,768 --> 02:28:22,420
Cooper...

1745
02:28:22,520 --> 02:28:25,322
they didn't bring us here
to change the past.

1746
02:28:28,609 --> 02:28:30,178
Say that again.

1747
02:28:30,278 --> 02:28:34,039
They didn't bring us here
to change the past.

1748
02:28:38,161 --> 02:28:40,421
No, they didn't bring
us here at all.

1749
02:28:44,750 --> 02:28:46,919
We brought ourselves.

1750
02:28:55,678 --> 02:29:00,024
TARS, give me the coordinates
for NASA in binary.

1751
02:29:00,266 --> 02:29:03,027
In binary. Roger. Feeding data.

1752
02:29:27,043 --> 02:29:29,461
"It's not a ghost."

1753
02:29:30,713 --> 02:29:32,448
"It's gravity."

1754
02:29:32,548 --> 02:29:34,517
Don't you get it yet, TARS?

1755
02:29:34,884 --> 02:29:36,977
I brought myself here!

1756
02:29:37,553 --> 02:29:41,357
We're here to communicate
with the three-dimensional world.

1757
02:29:41,474 --> 02:29:43,275
We're the bridge!

1758
02:29:50,983 --> 02:29:53,077
I thought they chose me.

1759
02:29:56,113 --> 02:30:00,084
- But they didn't choose me, they chose her.
- For what, Cooper?

1760
02:30:02,286 --> 02:30:04,255
To save the world.

1761
02:30:08,251 --> 02:30:12,864
All of this is one little girl's bedroom.
Every moment.

1762
02:30:12,964 --> 02:30:14,449
It's infinitely complex.

1763
02:30:14,549 --> 02:30:16,839
They have access to
infinite time and space,

1764
02:30:16,864 --> 02:30:19,394
but they're not
bound by anything!

1765
02:30:19,470 --> 02:30:24,441
They can't find a specific place in time.
They can't communicate.

1766
02:30:25,643 --> 02:30:28,713
That's why I'm here.
I'm gonna find a way to tell Murph...

1767
02:30:28,813 --> 02:30:30,381
just like I found this moment.

1768
02:30:30,481 --> 02:30:32,884
- How, Cooper?
- Love, TARS, love.

1769
02:30:32,984 --> 02:30:37,472
It's just like Brand said. My connection with
Murph, it is quantifiable. It's the key!

1770
02:30:37,572 --> 02:30:39,748
What are we here to do?

1771
02:30:40,366 --> 02:30:42,543
Find how to tell her.

1772
02:30:45,037 --> 02:30:46,672
The watch.

1773
02:30:49,500 --> 02:30:50,968
The watch.

1774
02:30:52,044 --> 02:30:53,470
That's it.

1775
02:30:55,673 --> 02:30:58,976
We code the data into the movement
of the second hand.

1776
02:31:02,305 --> 02:31:05,583
TARS, translate the data into Morse
and feed it to me.

1777
02:31:05,683 --> 02:31:10,279
Translating data to Morse.
Cooper, what if she never came back for it?

1778
02:31:11,647 --> 02:31:14,617
She will. She will.

1779
02:31:15,526 --> 02:31:17,453
Murph, I can see his car!

1780
02:31:18,362 --> 02:31:19,630
He's coming, Murph!

1781
02:31:21,365 --> 02:31:23,500
Okay. I'm coming down.

1782
02:31:24,660 --> 02:31:26,462
How do you know?

1783
02:31:29,373 --> 02:31:31,508
Because I gave it to her.

1784
02:31:36,589 --> 02:31:39,391
Roger.
Morse is dot-dot-dash-dot.

1785
02:31:42,595 --> 02:31:44,022
Dot-dot...

1786
02:31:45,056 --> 02:31:47,024
dash-dot.

1787
02:31:47,183 --> 02:31:49,126
Dot-dash-dot-dot.

1788
02:31:49,226 --> 02:31:52,196
Dot-dash-dot-dot.

1789
02:31:52,396 --> 02:31:53,965
Dash-dash-dash.

1790
02:31:54,065 --> 02:31:56,617
Dash, dash, dash.

1791
02:32:14,585 --> 02:32:16,420
He came back!

1792
02:32:16,837 --> 02:32:21,308
It was him all the time!
I didn't know. It was him!

1793
02:32:22,093 --> 02:32:24,353
Dad's gonna save us.

1794
02:33:06,804 --> 02:33:08,155
Eureka!

1795
02:33:11,809 --> 02:33:13,444
It's traditional.

1796
02:33:17,732 --> 02:33:19,658
Eureka!

1797
02:33:24,071 --> 02:33:25,640
Did it work?

1798
02:33:25,740 --> 02:33:27,875
I think it might have.

1799
02:33:28,951 --> 02:33:30,311
How do you know?

1800
02:33:30,411 --> 02:33:34,089
Because the bulk beings
are closing the tesseract.

1801
02:33:37,626 --> 02:33:39,928
Don't you get it yet, TARS?

1802
02:33:40,796 --> 02:33:42,931
They're not "beings."

1803
02:33:43,299 --> 02:33:44,933
They're us.

1804
02:33:46,677 --> 02:33:50,105
What I've been doing for Murph,
they're doing for me.

1805
02:33:50,347 --> 02:33:51,916
For all of us.

1806
02:33:52,016 --> 02:33:54,335
Cooper, people
couldn't build this.

1807
02:33:54,435 --> 02:33:57,088
No. No, not yet.

1808
02:33:57,188 --> 02:33:58,947
But one day.

1809
02:33:59,315 --> 02:34:02,826
Not you and me. But people.

1810
02:34:03,194 --> 02:34:07,539
A civilization that's evolved past
the four dimensions we know.

1811
02:34:13,829 --> 02:34:15,631
What happens now?

1812
02:35:17,935 --> 02:35:19,695
Mr. Cooper.

1813
02:35:23,607 --> 02:35:25,617
All right. Let's take it slow, sir.

1814
02:35:25,734 --> 02:35:27,928
Nice and easy, Mr. Cooper.

1815
02:35:28,028 --> 02:35:33,375
Remember, you're no spring chicken anymore.
Actually, you are 124 years old.

1816
02:35:40,082 --> 02:35:41,717
Take it slow, sir.

1817
02:35:42,334 --> 02:35:44,862
You were, uh...
extremely lucky.

1818
02:35:44,962 --> 02:35:48,599
The Rangers found you with only minutes
left in your oxygen supply.

1819
02:36:02,479 --> 02:36:04,114
Where am I?

1820
02:36:05,482 --> 02:36:07,326
Cooper Station.

1821
02:36:08,444 --> 02:36:10,287
Currently orbiting Saturn.

1822
02:36:11,989 --> 02:36:14,333
Cooper Station.

1823
02:36:16,493 --> 02:36:18,562
Nice of you to name it after me.

1824
02:36:22,333 --> 02:36:23,484
What?

1825
02:36:23,584 --> 02:36:26,995
The station isn't named after you, sir.
It's, uh... named after your daughter.

1826
02:36:27,296 --> 02:36:30,366
Although she's always maintained
just how important you were.

1827
02:36:30,466 --> 02:36:32,476
Is she still alive?

1828
02:36:34,136 --> 02:36:36,314
She'll be here in
a couple weeks.

1829
02:36:37,056 --> 02:36:39,583
She is far too old to be transferring
from another station...

1830
02:36:39,683 --> 02:36:42,361
but when she heard
that you'd been found...

1831
02:36:43,270 --> 02:36:46,081
well, this is, uh... Murphy Cooper
we're talking about.

1832
02:36:46,857 --> 02:36:48,659
Yes, it is.

1833
02:36:50,486 --> 02:36:53,288
We'll have you checked out of here
in a couple days.

1834
02:36:55,658 --> 02:36:58,460
I'm sure you'll be excited to see
what's in store.

1835
02:36:59,411 --> 02:37:03,607
I actually, uh... did a paper on you
in high school.

1836
02:37:03,707 --> 02:37:06,343
I know all about your life
back on Earth.

1837
02:37:07,711 --> 02:37:08,946
Oh, yeah.

1838
02:37:09,046 --> 02:37:10,597
Right.

1839
02:37:12,716 --> 02:37:18,355
If... If you'll follow me,
we've got a really good situation for you.

1840
02:37:21,392 --> 02:37:25,737
So, uh... when I made my suggestion
to Miss Cooper...

1841
02:37:26,355 --> 02:37:29,649
I was delighted to hear
that she thought it was perfect.

1842
02:37:32,528 --> 02:37:35,890
It was just constant.
Just that steady blow of dirt.

1843
02:37:35,990 --> 02:37:38,976
Of course,
I didn't speak to her personally.

1844
02:37:39,076 --> 02:37:41,145
We always set the plate upside-down.

1845
02:37:41,245 --> 02:37:44,064
Glasses or cups,
whatever it was, upside-down.

1846
02:37:44,164 --> 02:37:49,153
Well, my dad was a farmer.
Uh, like everybody else back then.

1847
02:37:49,253 --> 02:37:51,780
There just wasn't enough food.

1848
02:37:51,880 --> 02:37:54,658
We wore little things, little strips...

1849
02:37:54,758 --> 02:37:59,997
of sheet over our nose and mouth
so we wouldn't breathe so much of it.

1850
02:38:00,097 --> 02:38:03,626
Well, it was pretty exciting for me
because it was hope.

1851
02:38:03,726 --> 02:38:08,005
I don't care who describes it,
there is no way for it to be exaggerated.

1852
02:38:08,105 --> 02:38:12,009
She did confirm
just how much you loved farming.

1853
02:38:12,109 --> 02:38:15,454
- Oh, she did, did she?
- Yeah. Come here.

1854
02:38:15,738 --> 02:38:20,768
Home sweet home. Everything
replaced and put back where it...

1855
02:38:27,082 --> 02:38:29,193
- Hey, is this...?
- Oh, yeah.

1856
02:38:29,293 --> 02:38:32,363
The machine we found out near Saturn
when we found you. Yes.

1857
02:38:32,463 --> 02:38:35,199
Its, uh... power source was shot,
but we could get you another one.

1858
02:38:35,299 --> 02:38:37,768
Yes. Please.

1859
02:38:38,677 --> 02:38:40,312
Settings.

1860
02:38:40,471 --> 02:38:42,272
General settings.

1861
02:38:42,473 --> 02:38:44,608
Security settings.

1862
02:38:47,019 --> 02:38:49,613
Honesty, new setting,

1863
02:38:50,481 --> 02:38:52,341
95 percent.

1864
02:38:52,441 --> 02:38:55,243
Confirmed. Additional
customization?

1865
02:38:55,819 --> 02:38:57,245
Humor,

1866
02:38:58,447 --> 02:39:00,224
75 percent.

1867
02:39:00,324 --> 02:39:01,958
Confirmed.

1868
02:39:02,326 --> 02:39:05,521
Auto self-destruct
T-minus 10, nine...

1869
02:39:05,621 --> 02:39:07,839
Let's make that 60 percent.

1870
02:39:09,833 --> 02:39:12,261
Sixty percent confirmed.

1871
02:39:12,586 --> 02:39:15,972
- Knock-knock.
- You want 55?

1872
02:39:20,552 --> 02:39:22,979
Is this really what it was like?

1873
02:39:24,890 --> 02:39:27,609
It was never this clean, Slick.
Heh.

1874
02:39:31,814 --> 02:39:35,784
I don't care much for this pretending
we're back where we started.

1875
02:39:37,569 --> 02:39:40,163
I want to know where we are.

1876
02:39:41,490 --> 02:39:43,333
Where we're going.

1877
02:39:47,579 --> 02:39:50,733
- Mr. Cooper. The family's all in there.
- Yeah.

1878
02:39:50,833 --> 02:39:51,984
Family?

1879
02:39:52,084 --> 02:39:56,163
Yeah, they all came out to see her. She's
been in cryo-sleep for almost two years.

1880
02:40:29,037 --> 02:40:31,620
You told them I like farming.

1881
02:40:36,879 --> 02:40:39,047
It was me, Murph.

1882
02:40:41,008 --> 02:40:43,101
I was your ghost.

1883
02:40:44,094 --> 02:40:46,021
I know.

1884
02:40:47,514 --> 02:40:49,197
People didn't believe me.

1885
02:40:49,222 --> 02:40:52,318
They thought that I was
doing it all myself.

1886
02:40:52,394 --> 02:40:53,737
But...

1887
02:40:56,315 --> 02:40:58,775
I knew who it was.

1888
02:41:03,238 --> 02:41:05,707
Nobody believed me.

1889
02:41:05,908 --> 02:41:08,527
But I knew you'd come back.

1890
02:41:10,913 --> 02:41:12,422
How?

1891
02:41:14,124 --> 02:41:17,552
Because my dad promised me.

1892
02:41:23,300 --> 02:41:25,602
Well, I'm here now, Murph.

1893
02:41:26,495 --> 02:41:28,430
I'm here.

1894
02:41:29,389 --> 02:41:30,924
No.

1895
02:41:32,809 --> 02:41:37,239
No parent should have to watch
their own child die.

1896
02:41:39,858 --> 02:41:43,027
I have my kids here for me now.

1897
02:41:45,022 --> 02:41:47,123
You go.

1898
02:41:49,743 --> 02:41:51,545
Where?

1899
02:41:54,748 --> 02:41:56,633
Brand.

1900
02:42:05,976 --> 02:42:08,303
<i>She's out there...</i>

1901
02:42:13,826 --> 02:42:16,278
<i>setting up camp.</i>

1902
02:42:42,462 --> 02:42:44,472
<i>Alone...</i>

1903
02:42:45,340 --> 02:42:48,310
<i>in a strange galaxy.</i>

1904
02:42:58,895 --> 02:43:03,867
<i>Maybe right now
she's settling in for the long nap...</i>

1905
02:43:21,918 --> 02:43:25,055
<i>by the light of our new sun...</i>

1906
02:43:40,228 --> 02:43:42,572
<i>in our new home.</i>
