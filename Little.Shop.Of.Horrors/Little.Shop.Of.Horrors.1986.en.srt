<i>...till the weekend.

39
00:04:17,412 --> 00:04:21,146
<i>And at his press conference today,
President Kennedy fielded questions</i>

40
00:04:21,216 --> 00:04:24,214
<i>concerning last Thursday's
total eclipse of the sun,</i>

41

<i>an unprecedented astrological
phenomenon which has baffled the nation.</i>

<i>Ah! So! She finally
decides</i> to come to work!

Uh, good morning, Mr. Mushnik.

44
00:04:53,016 --> 00:04:56,815
What morning? It's almost closing time.
Not that we had a customer.

45
00:04:57,287 --> 00:05:01,388
Seymour, what in the name of
God is going on down there?

46
00:05:02,326 --> 00:05:04,571
Audrey, would you go down
and see what he's...

47
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,799
Audrey! Audrey, where
did you get that shiner?

48
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,500
Uh... a shiner?

49
00:05:10,834 --> 00:05:14,496
Audrey, that greasy boyfriend of
yours is beating up on you again?

50
00:05:14,673 --> 00:05:16,996
No! I know it's none of my business,

51
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:20,541
but I'm beginning to think
he's maybe not such a nice boy.

52
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:23,240
I got these pots
unloaded for you, Mr...

<i>Seymour, look what you've
done to the inventory!

- Is that new eye make-up?
- Oh!

57
00:05:35,194 --> 00:05:39,156
I'll help him clean it up
before any of the customers get here.

58
00:05:39,197 --> 00:05:41,256
That should give you plenty of time.

Misfit employees, bums on the sidewalk,

00:11:25,956 --> 00:11:28,616
Seymour, why don't you
run downstairs and bring up

148
00:11:28,692 --> 00:11:33,488
that strange and interesting new
plant you've been working on?

149
00:11:34,085 --> 00:11:35,803
You see, Mr. Mushnik,

150
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:37,819
Some of those exotic
plants Seymour's been

151
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:41,229
tinkering around with...
are really unusual.

152
00:11:41,305 --> 00:11:45,805
And we thought that maybe some of
those strange and interesting new plants

153
00:11:45,876 --> 00:11:50,342
prominently displayed and...
and advertised, would attract business.

154
00:11:54,185 --> 00:11:57,252
I'm afraid it isn't
feeling very well today.

155
00:11:57,321 --> 00:12:00,046
There, now, isn't that bizarre?

156
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:02,287
At least.

157
00:12:02,593 --> 00:12:04,785
What kind of a weirdo
plant is that, Seymour?

158
00:12:04,863 --> 00:12:07,263
I don't know.
I think it's some kind of flytrap,

159
00:12:07,332 --> 00:12:09,782
but I haven't been able to identify it
in any of my books.

160
00:12:10,035 --> 00:12:13,998
I gave it my own name though,
I call it an Audrey II.

161
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:17,174
- After me?
- I hope you don't mind.

162
00:12:17,377 --> 00:12:21,034
You see, sir, if you were to put a...
a strange and interesting plant like this

163
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:24,046
here in... in the window,
then... then maybe...

164
00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:26,262
Maybe what? Maybe what?

165
00:12:26,419 --> 00:12:28,880
Do you have any idea
how ridiculous you sound?

166
00:12:28,988 --> 00:12:33,280
Just because you put a strange and interesting
plant in the window people don't suddenly...

167
00:12:33,626 --> 00:12:38,054
Excuse me, I couldn't help noticing
that strange and<i> interesting plant.

168
00:12:38,165 --> 00:12:41,551
- <i>What is it?</i>
- It's an Audrey II.

169
00:12:41,668 --> 00:12:43,726
I've never seen anything like it before.

170
00:12:43,803 --> 00:12:46,433
- No one has.
- Where did you get it?

171
00:12:48,337 --> 00:12:49,573
Well...

172
00:12:49,776 --> 00:12:52,707
Do you remember that total
eclipse of the sun about a week ago?

How's everybody doin' today? I got a little
bit of a stiff neck. Let me just fix this up.

308
00:22:45,493 --> 00:22:47,338
I'm right here, Wink,
I'm sorry, I love your show...

309
00:22:47,361 --> 00:22:49,352

Oh! You got me!
<i>Oh, oh, oh, I feel...

Okay, our first guest today is a young man
<i>you probably read about in the newspapers,

Seymour Krelborn,
is that correct?

315
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:11,275
Who has discovered a new breed of
plant life hitherto unknown on this planet.

316
00:23:11,453 --> 00:23:14,210
Let me play you down
to your seat, Seymour.

317
00:23:16,226 --> 00:23:18,217
Hello, Seymour!

318
00:23:18,247 --> 00:23:19,803
Um...

319
00:23:20,062 --> 00:23:21,463
Hello, Wink.

320
00:23:21,631 --> 00:23:23,857
Hey, I wish you folks
at home could see this.

321
00:23:23,932 --> 00:23:27,364
Seymour, where did you get
such a weird plant?

322
00:23:30,707 --> 00:23:35,040
Well, you remember that total
eclipse of the sun about a week ago?

326
00:23:41,951 --> 00:23:42,975
<i>Gosh, no!</i>

337
00:24:08,479 --> 00:24:10,870
Seymour's first radio broadcast.

338
00:24:10,948 --> 00:24:14,779
I wanted to hear it so bad.
I tried to be on time, but...

339
00:24:14,852 --> 00:24:19,419
- Don't tell me, you got tied up?
- No, just handcuffed a little.

340
00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:23,353
Girl! Hey, girl!

341
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:27,186
I don't know who this mess is you been hangin'
out with, but he is hazardous to your health.

342
00:24:27,298 --> 00:24:29,957
Oh, that's for sure,
but I can't leave him.

343
00:24:30,067 --> 00:24:32,093
- Why not?
- Oh, he'd get angry.

344
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:36,504
And if he does this when he likes me,
imagine what he'd do if he ever got mad.

345
00:24:36,573 --> 00:24:39,634
So, dump the chump,
get another guy and let him protect you.

346
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:42,375
How about the little

- Seymour?
- That him.

Oh, we're just friends.

349
00:24:46,118 --> 00:24:52,617
I don't even deserve a desperate, sweet,
considerate, suddenly successful guy like Seymour.

350
00:24:52,725 --> 00:24:55,471
That poor child suffers
from low self-image.

Yes, yes, yes, yes, Mrs. Shiva.

- No, Mrs. Shiva.
- I'd like to pay for these.

Do you hear this, God? He forgot!

425
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,735
Are you listening, customers?
He forgot!

426
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:33,434
Audrey, quick! We've got to do
an<i> emergency arrangement.

427
00:31:33,506 --> 00:31:35,106
Birthday? Wedding? Baby?

428
00:31:35,308 --> 00:31:37,534
- Funeral.
- Get me the lilies.

429
00:31:38,345 --> 00:31:41,605
Mr. Mushnik's real mad at me,
Audrey, I keep forgettin' things.

430
00:31:41,648 --> 00:31:44,376
Scissors. You got a lot on your mind.

431
00:31:44,451 --> 00:31:48,261
Mind? What mind? The Shivas are
our most important funereal account.

432
00:31:48,291 --> 00:31:50,713
A big, enormous family,
they're dropping off like flies!

433
00:31:50,892 --> 00:31:53,794
Sometimes I think Mr.
Mushnik's too hard on you.

434
00:31:54,143 --> 00:31:56,495
- Glue.
- Well, that's okay,

435
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:58,928
- after all, I owe him everything.
- Glitter.

436
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,400
He took me out of the Skid Row Home
for Boys when I was just a little tike,

437
00:32:02,436 --> 00:32:06,902
gave me a warm place to stay,
floors to sweep, toilets to clean,

438
00:32:07,007 --> 00:32:08,742
and every other Sunday off.

439
00:32:08,909 --> 00:32:13,136
You know, I... I think you ought
to raise your expectations, Seymour.

440
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,707
Now that you're getting successful, I mean.

441
00:32:16,951 --> 00:32:19,786
It's clear you suffer
from a low self-image,

442
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:22,345
and it's high time
you get it fixed.

443
00:32:22,622 --> 00:32:25,922
Why don't you go out and...
and do something nice for yourself like.

444
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:28,120
buy some new clothes?

445
00:32:28,463 --> 00:32:30,929
Well, I'm a very
bad shopper, Audrey.

446
00:32:31,365 --> 00:32:33,900
I don't have good taste, like you.

447
00:32:34,537 --> 00:32:38,902
Oh... uh...
but I could help you pick things out.

448
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:41,866
- You could?
- Sure.

449
00:32:42,444 --> 00:32:44,702
You'd go shopping with me?

450
00:32:45,447 --> 00:32:46,470
Sure.

451
00:32:47,149 --> 00:32:50,976
You'd be seen with me in a public
place like a department store?

452
00:32:51,454 --> 00:32:52,711
Sure.

453
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:55,483
Tonight?

454
00:32:55,756 --> 00:32:57,890
Oh, I can't tonight,
I got a date.

455
00:32:57,961 --> 00:32:59,822
Again, this date?

456
00:33:00,262 --> 00:33:01,187
Some date.

457
00:33:01,296 --> 00:33:03,957
A date gives you a corsage,
not a multiple fracture.

458
00:33:04,032 --> 00:33:07,297
I'm tellin' you, Audrey,
he's not a good, clean kind of boy.

459
00:33:07,337 --> 00:33:08,564
He's a professional.

460
00:33:08,637 --> 00:33:12,765
What kind of a professional rides a
motorcycle and wears a black leather jacket?

You ought to see the
way he treats her, Twoey.

540

She deserves a prince,

I think I need a root canal.

I'm sure I need a long,
slow root canal.

Let's go.

665
00:45:59,878 --> 00:46:02,610
- I have a history of dental problems.
- Shut up!

666
00:46:03,982 --> 00:46:05,313
Yes, Doctor.

667
00:46:10,722 --> 00:46:13,555
<i>I went to a terrible dentist</i> on Wednesday,
who was recommended to me by...

668
00:46:13,625 --> 00:46:15,388
somebody that I saw Monday...

669
00:46:15,459 --> 00:46:17,986
who's the brother of a man
that I usually see Sundays.

670
00:46:18,064 --> 00:46:20,328
And their mother actually taught
them everything they know.

671
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,029
She's incredibly gifted, and quite elderly and a
lot of people think she shouldn't be working, but...

672
00:46:24,203 --> 00:46:27,933
<i>I go to her because I'm just
incredibly devoted to her strength.

673
00:46:28,541 --> 00:46:32,500
She can't really see who you are, but she
knows... she knows the sound of your voice.

674
00:46:32,579 --> 00:46:34,215
<i>And if you tell her
where it is, the problem,

675
00:46:34,245 --> 00:46:37,109
<i>she eventually works</i> her way back and
she finds the trouble and she does it.

676
00:46:37,183 --> 00:46:40,516
I wish I had that stamina,
'cause I can only go so long.

677
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:44,048
<i>That's how I want</i> to be.
I don't ever want to have to be just...

678
00:46:45,225 --> 00:46:48,326
- Comfy?
- Yes, Doctor.

679
00:46:49,395 --> 00:46:51,429
<i>I remember the first time
I went to a dentist.

680
00:46:51,497 --> 00:46:54,159
<i>I thought, "Gosh, what a neat
job! If only I were a dentist."

681
00:46:54,233 --> 00:46:56,395
<i>The dentist I went
to had the greatest car.

682
00:46:56,470 --> 00:46:57,820
<i>He had a Corvette. I thought,

683
00:46:57,850 --> 00:47:00,995
<i>"My gosh, everybody calls him ' Doctor'
and he's not really a doctor."

684
00:47:01,207 --> 00:47:02,538
Oh, my God!

685
00:47:05,713 --> 00:47:09,977
Only I got out of there okay<i>, and then,
and then,</i> ya know, after it was all finished...

686
00:47:10,018 --> 00:47:13,551
they gave me a candy bar. I
thought, "This is what I get, a candy bar?"

687
00:47:14,421 --> 00:47:17,391
<i>This is what you do,</i> you go through a
little thing you get chocolate out of it.

688
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:22,423
For getting to work with incredible professionals,
using incredibly, incredibly wonderful equipment...

689
00:47:22,696 --> 00:47:24,745
- and that's...
- Let's look at that mouth.

690
00:47:26,266 --> 00:47:29,755
<i>- Say, "Aaah".
- Aaaaah!

691
00:47:30,937 --> 00:47:33,743
<i>Aaah! Candy bar!

692
00:47:33,773 --> 00:47:35,915
<i>Oh! Candy bar! Candy bar!

Yes.

Oh, your mouth's a mess, kid.

734

That wisdom tooth. We'll just rip

00:49:46,045 --> 00:49:47,112
- Now, what do you say?
- No, let me...

736
00:49:47,142 --> 00:49:49,741
There's always time for
dental hygiene, Seymour.

737
00:49:49,849 --> 00:49:52,851
You ever seen the results
of a neglected mouth?

738

00:49:59,859 --> 00:50:01,521
<i>Unless I take immediate action!

741
00:50:01,661 --> 00:50:04,264
- Uh, what's that?
- A drill.

742
00:50:04,632 --> 00:50:07,162
- It's rusty!
- It's an antique.

743
00:50:07,267 --> 00:50:09,736
They don't make them like this anymore.

744
00:50:09,969 --> 00:50:11,170
Sturdy...

745
00:50:11,271 --> 00:50:12,569
heavy...

746
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:14,363
dull.

747
00:50:17,545 --> 00:50:20,077
I'm going to want some gas for this.

748
00:50:20,548 --> 00:50:23,981
Oh, thank god,
I thought you wouldn't use any.

749
00:50:24,051 --> 00:50:27,379
The gas isn't for you,
Seymour, It's for me.

750
00:50:27,421 --> 00:50:31,266
You see, I want to really enjoy this.

751
00:50:31,296 --> 00:50:35,368
In fact, I'm going to use
my special gas mask!

752
00:50:35,831 --> 00:50:41,025
<i>I find a little giggle gas before I
begin increases my pleasure enormously.

753
00:50:45,906 --> 00:50:47,775
Here we go!

754
00:51:00,588 --> 00:51:03,973
Oh, Seymour, I'm flying!

755
00:51:04,292 --> 00:51:06,960
The things I'm going
to do to that mouth!

756
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:30,714
<i>What the hell's that?</i>
A gun?

757
00:51:31,654 --> 00:51:34,281
The kid's got a goddamn revolver!

758
00:51:35,493 --> 00:51:39,055
Oh, Jesus,
I'm in trouble now, huh?

759
00:51:40,896 --> 00:51:43,873
Oh, wait till I turn this gas off.

760
00:51:46,618 --> 00:51:48,261
Uh-oh.

761
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,002
Oh, give me a hand,
would ya? Huh?

762
00:51:51,309 --> 00:51:53,935
No, I guess you wouldn't, would ya?

763
00:51:58,612 --> 00:52:01,377
You see, Seymour, I could asphyx...

764
00:52:03,062 --> 00:52:04,675
Asphyx...

765
00:52:12,897 --> 00:52:15,478
What'd I ever do to you?

766
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:19,771
- Nothing, it's what you did to her.
- Her who?

767
00:52:22,107 --> 00:52:25,641
<i>Oh,</i> her.

768
00:53:17,239 --> 00:53:19,221
Shh! Go away.

769
00:53:23,872 --> 00:53:28,332
- Um! Chop it up.
- What?

770
00:53:28,575 --> 00:53:31,606
- Feed me!
- Okay, okay.

771
00:53:34,855 --> 00:53:36,228
Oh, brother.

772
00:55:06,169 --> 00:55:09,305
Gimme, gimme, gimme,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

773
00:56:11,611 --> 00:56:14,972
- Audrey, what'd they say to you?
- Oh, who?

774
00:56:15,415 --> 00:56:17,815
- The police.
- Oh, uh, nothing.

775
00:56:19,352 --> 00:56:21,880
Audrey, talk to me,
tell me what they said.

776
00:56:22,389 --> 00:56:24,853
It's Orin, they say
he's disappeared!

777
00:56:25,759 --> 00:56:29,822
- The... the police, they told you that?
- They suspect foul play.

778
00:56:30,965 --> 00:56:32,024
They do?

779
00:56:32,098 --> 00:56:35,989
His receptionist, this morning
she found the place a shambles.

780
00:56:36,203 --> 00:56:37,897
Gas masks everywhere.

781
00:56:38,272 --> 00:56:40,794
Things all over the floor.

782
00:56:41,108 --> 00:56:42,507
They think...

783
00:56:43,678 --> 00:56:46,476
I can't even think
about what they think.

784
00:56:54,867 --> 00:56:56,563
Audrey?

785
00:56:58,593 --> 00:57:00,554
Don't cry, Audrey.

786
00:57:01,796 --> 00:57:05,158
Would it be so terrible if
something had happened to him?

787
00:57:06,334 --> 00:57:08,394
Seymour, what a thing to say!

788
00:57:09,237 --> 00:57:10,761
Well, would it?

789
00:57:12,307 --> 00:57:14,398
It wouldn't be terrible at all...

790
00:57:15,444 --> 00:57:17,243
it'd be a miracle.

791
00:57:17,546 --> 00:57:22,006
Not to mention all the money I'd
save on Epsom salts and Ace bandages.

792
00:57:22,285 --> 00:57:23,410
You see?

793
00:57:24,253 --> 00:57:26,944
But I'd still feel guilty,
I mean...

794
00:57:27,022 --> 00:57:31,822
if he met with foul play or
some terrible accident of some kind,

795
00:57:32,061 --> 00:57:34,586
it'd be partly my
fault just because...

796
00:57:36,432 --> 00:57:38,332
secretly I wished it.

797
00:57:38,401 --> 00:57:42,302
Audrey, don't you waste another
minute thinking about that creep!

798
00:57:42,605 --> 00:57:47,310
There's a lot of guys that'd...
give anything to go out with you.

799
00:57:48,644 --> 00:57:53,887
- Nice guys.
- I don't deserve a nice guy, Seymour.

800
00:57:54,351 --> 00:57:56,910
- That's not true.
- You don't know the half of it!

801
00:57:56,986 --> 00:57:59,046
I've led a terrible life.

802
00:57:59,123 --> 00:58:04,381
I deserved a...
a creep like Orin Scrivello, D.D.S.

803
00:58:04,928 --> 00:58:07,052
You know where I<i> met him?

804
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:12,462
- In The Gutter.
- The Gutter?

805
00:58:12,602 --> 00:58:15,072
The Gutter, it's a nightspot.

806
00:58:15,606 --> 00:58:19,270
I worked there on my nights off
when we weren't making much money.

807
00:58:19,343 --> 00:58:20,901
I'd put on...

808
00:58:21,079 --> 00:58:24,815
cheap and tasteless outfits,
not nice ones like this.

809
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:28,544
Low and nasty apparel.

810
00:58:28,753 --> 00:58:33,181
Audrey, that's all behind you now,
you got nothing to be ashamed of.

811
00:58:33,992 --> 00:58:37,383
You're a very nice person.
I always knew you were.

812
00:58:38,363 --> 00:58:42,375
Underneath the bruises and the
handcuffs, you know what I saw?

813
00:58:43,068 --> 00:58:47,189
A girl I respected.
I still do.

I scared him?
After what I seen, I scared him?

864
01:03:08,409 --> 01:03:11,173
Do you think I didn't know, huh?
Oh, I knew.

865
01:03:11,413 --> 01:03:14,280
<i>I knew you lay down here,

What depths? What sink?
What are you talking about?

870

You know, Krelborn,
it kills me doing this, but...

900
01:04:56,454 --> 01:05:00,550
considering you're almost
like a son to me, I'm thinking...

901
01:05:00,624 --> 01:05:02,855
maybe we don't have
to go to the police.

902
01:05:04,029 --> 01:05:06,997
- We don't?
- I'm thinking...

903
01:05:07,366 --> 01:05:12,068
what if I kept my mouth shut and
gave you a one-way ticket outta town?

904
01:05:13,238 --> 01:05:15,454
You'd do that, sir?

905
01:05:16,576 --> 01:05:20,275
You could lay low for a
while, say 30, 40 years.

906
01:05:20,446 --> 01:05:25,183
- Meanwhile, I would keep the plant.
- The plant?

907
01:05:25,218 --> 01:05:29,211
Of course, you'd have to teach me
how to take care of it while you're away.

908
01:05:29,489 --> 01:05:32,680
Give me your secret gardening tips.

about this particularly
amazing agricultural phenomenon,

a phenomenon, I might
add, that has made you one of

Where do you keep the plant food?

It doesn't eat plant food,

01:16:28,905 --> 01:16:31,398
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

1046
01:16:33,540 --> 01:16:35,244
Audrey! Audrey!

1047
01:16:36,012 --> 01:16:37,810
Yes, I... I'm okay.

1048
01:16:37,881 --> 01:16:40,629
I'm sorry, Audrey, I'm just so
sorry, I never meant to hurt you.

1049
01:16:40,659 --> 01:16:42,010
I never meant to hurt anybody.

1050
01:16:42,118 --> 01:16:45,485
It's just that somehow it makes
things happen, terrible things.

1051
01:16:45,655 --> 01:16:48,283
Oh, I guess I shoulda stopped
when I found out what it lived on, but...

1052
01:16:48,357 --> 01:16:50,155
it was so cute and harmless and...

1053
01:16:50,227 --> 01:16:53,458
we started doing business and
making money and you liked me and...

1054
01:16:53,565 --> 01:16:57,833
Seymour, do you really think
I liked you because of that?

1055
01:16:59,970 --> 01:17:03,199
I liked you from the day
I came to work here.

1056
01:17:03,307 --> 01:17:06,938
You mean, you'd still like
me even if I wasn't famous?

1057
01:17:08,979 --> 01:17:11,648
I'd still love you, Seymour.

1058
01:17:12,449 --> 01:17:13,976
Really?

1059
01:17:14,251 --> 01:17:17,987
All I ever wanted... was you...

1060
01:17:19,223 --> 01:17:21,714
and a sweet little house.

1061
01:17:22,426 --> 01:17:25,259
Oh, Audrey, you're the most
wonderful person that ever lived.

1062
01:17:25,329 --> 01:17:28,788
We're gonna get that little house and
everything'll be okay somehow, you'll see.

1063
01:17:28,866 --> 01:17:32,467
♫ Suddenly Seymour ♫

1064
01:17:33,072 --> 01:17:36,432
♫ is standing beside you. ♫

1065
01:17:36,542 --> 01:17:41,138

I wanna discuss with ya.

1070
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:58,197
Now, which one of you
is Seymour Krelborn?

1071
01:17:59,198 --> 01:18:01,123
- I am.
- Oh, it's a pleasure.

1072
01:18:01,199 --> 01:18:04,294
Boy, has your phone been busy!
I've been trying to reach you for weeks.

1073
01:18:04,370 --> 01:18:08,671
Patrick Martin, Licensing and Marketing,
World Botanical Enterprises.

1074
01:18:08,742 --> 01:18:12,542
Son, kid, boy, are we gonna
make a fortune together!

1075
01:18:12,679 --> 01:18:15,546
- He's not interested.
- Oh, he will be.

1076
01:18:16,382 --> 01:18:20,246
Ya see, me and the guys at the home
office have been following this plant o'yours,

1077
01:18:20,319 --> 01:18:23,448
and we've come up with
one incredible idea.

1078
01:18:24,090 --> 01:18:25,852
We're very proud of it.

1079
01:18:26,159 --> 01:18:27,524
Picture this.

1080
01:18:28,727 --> 01:18:32,289
We take leaf cuttings,
develop little Audrey IIs...

1081
01:18:32,533 --> 01:18:36,127
and sell them to florist
shops across the nation.

1082
01:18:36,304 --> 01:18:40,901
Why, pretty soon every household
in America could have one.

1083
01:18:41,341 --> 01:18:42,809
Every household in America!

1084
01:18:43,411 --> 01:18:46,039
For starters, kid.
Why this thing could go...

1085
01:18:46,681 --> 01:18:48,080
worldwide!

1086
01:18:48,249 --> 01:18:49,449
- Worldwide?
- Worldwide?

1087
01:18:49,483 --> 01:18:53,146
Think of it, boy,
Audrey IIs everywhere!

1088
01:18:53,420 --> 01:18:56,822
Why, with the right advertising, this
thing could be bigger than Hula-Hoops.

1089
01:18:56,891 --> 01:18:58,223
Bigger than Hula-Hoops?

1090
01:18:58,293 --> 01:19:02,276
What do you say, Seymour?
We have a deal?

1091
01:19:03,698 --> 01:19:07,259
No! Keep your contract.
Nobody's touching that plant, ya hear?

1092
01:19:07,334 --> 01:19:08,995
Hey, hey!
We're offering a lot of money.

1093
01:19:09,070 --> 01:19:11,301

1099
01:19:19,703 --> 01:19:21,574
- Go on! Get outta here, now!
- All right.

1100
01:19:21,650 --> 01:19:23,382

We gotta stop it, Seymour!
We got to!

1104

<i>- Seymour.

1106

No, it's me that got us into
