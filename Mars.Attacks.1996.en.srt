1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,572
Hey, howdy there, Mr. Lee.

3
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,033
What is this? Filipino New Year's?

4
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:36,035
No. Why you say that?

5
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,870
Because you're cooking up a feast.

6
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,664
I can smell it all the way
from the interstate.

7
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:43,292
What is that? Barbecue?

8
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,253
Oh, yeah. But it not coming from here.

9
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:48,422
What is that noise?

10
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,971
Daddy!

11
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:03,187
- Daddy!
- Daddy!

12
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,803
What is your take on this, Jerry?

13
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,681
The people are gonna love it,
Mr. President.

14
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:30,394
Our only conflict is whether we ambush
the 6:00 news or hold out for prime time.

15
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:32,938
Screw the press.
This is a need-to-know situation.

16
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,648
We should make it top secret...

17
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,984
...and move in right away
with DEFCON 4.

18
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:39,111
Mr. President, we cannot sit on this.

19
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:44,366
General Casey, do you have an opinion?

20
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,286
Well, sir, do we know they're hostile?

21
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,871
What do you mean,
"do we know they're hostile?"

22
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:52,749
They have our planet surrounded
with thousands of warships.

23
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,459
Do we know they're warships?

24
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:01,133
Professor, what do we know about them?

25
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:05,095
We know they're extremely advanced
technologically...

26
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:08,307
...which suggests, very rightfully so,
that they're peaceful.

27
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:13,228
An advanced civilization is,
by definition, not barbaric.

28
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:16,523
Mr. President, this is a great day.

29
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:20,485
I and all my colleagues
are extremely excited.

30
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,030
Good.

31
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:26,408
Extraterrestrial life.

32
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:28,577
You're right, Jerry.

33
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:31,079
The people are gonna love it.

34
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:33,707
This is a momentous occasion.

35
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,380
- Mr. President, we have to act...
- We'll go all media on this.

36
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:42,215
I'll wear my blue Cerruti suit.
And, Jerry, I'll need a good speech.

37
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:43,467
Statesman-like...

38
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:47,929
...historical and yet warm and neighborly.

39
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:51,892
Abraham Lincoln meets Leave It to Beaver.
You know the sort of thing. Heh.

40
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,185
Yes, sir.

41
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,103
- Are they too old-fashioned?
- Yes.

42
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,730
No, I don't think so.

43
00:05:56,898 --> 00:06:00,359
This has got the colors, but no.
I don't think so.

44
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,069
- Not vivid enough.
- Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

45
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:04,863
- Nancy had this in the library, didn't she?
- Yes, indeed.

46
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,156
I don't think so.

47
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:09,951
I thought perhaps the watered silk.
And this week it's on sale.

48
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:12,746
I hardly think I need worry about that.

49
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:15,582
My husband is the leader
of the free world.

50
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,877
What do you think, Taffy?

51
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:22,631
Why don't you leave the Roosevelt Room
the way the Roosevelts wanted it?

52
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:27,969
Because Eleanor Roosevelt
was too fond of chintz. That's why.

53
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:30,430
Mother, this isn't your house.

54
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:33,683
Taffy, if you're going to be a pest,
I'm going to ignore you.

55
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,603
- Mrs. Dale?
- Yes?

56
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,420
- I saw you fight Sonny Liston in '69.
- Really?

57
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,839
- You mean, you were a nun back then?
- Oh, yes.

58
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:07,050
We've always been fight fans,
haven't we, sisters?

59
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:09,094
Byron Williams, telephone.

60
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,221
- Byron Williams....
- That's me. I gotta go.

61
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,932
You ladies have a nice time, all right?
Thank you.

62
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:19,396
- Yeah?
- Byron?

63
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:20,605
Oh, Louise.

64
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:23,150
I'm sorry I have to call you at work.

65
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:27,946
The boys haven't been home in two nights
and I don't know what to do.

66
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,198
Listen, you're doing the best you can.

67
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,159
They're just at that age.

68
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:37,289
Louise, the casino manager's
giving me the evil eye. I've gotta go.

69
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,666
I'll call you later, okay?

70
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:43,628
Hey, are you still cool on me
coming to Washington?

71
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,464
Sure. Of course I am.

72
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:49,217
You take care, okay? Bye.

73
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,107
Ahh....

74
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,234
Do you have to drink in front of me?

75
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:08,528
You're an adult. Just cope.

76
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:11,823
It doesn't help me
that all we ever do is sit around in bars.

77
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,117
Hey. This is work, baby, okay?

78
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:17,704
I'm checking the decor,
the lighting, the traffic flow.

79
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:21,082
If I'd known you'd turn into a crook,
I never would have married you.

80
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,792
I'm not a crook.

81
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,337
I'm ambitious. There's a difference.

82
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,089
And if you think you can make
a nickel in this town...

83
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:32,135
...without knowing how to dally
around a few curves, well...

84
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,930
...you don't know doodlysquat
about the gaming industry.

85
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:36,306
Oh, Art.

86
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:40,435
Galaxy's gonna be
the best hotel in Vegas.

87
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:43,021
The best. I promise.

88
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,982
Don't you realize what you're doing?
Destroying the Earth.

89
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:49,027
All this greed. This money system.

90
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,904
You're destroying everything.

91
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,990
Okay, okay, Barbara. Okay.

92
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,826
Keep your voice down.

93
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,663
I got friends here.

94
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,250
Sugar. Hit me one more time.

95
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:06,211
- Stop flirting with the waitress.
- Oh, God. Here.

96
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,589
Go on over to the roulette...

97
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,801
...play our anniversary...

98
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,095
...and stay off of black.

99
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,391
Thanks, honey.

100
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,482
Yeah?

101
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,652
Make it quick.
We go out live in 10 minutes.

102
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,823
What? The actual president?
What do you mean, "cutting in"?

103
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,997
Budget negotiations may be dead
in the water after this week.

104
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,666
Hair looks good.

105
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,376
I like the hair.

106
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,438
...quote, "factually challenged."
Griffin says....

107
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,339
Yeah, Stone. Speak.

108
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:52,966
Jason, hi, it's me.

109
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,927
You wearing a bra?

110
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:59,764
Listen, this is big. President Dale
is cutting into my show today.

111
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:04,352
That's absurd. Why would he stoop
to being on Today in Fashion?

112
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,854
He's interrupting everybody.

113
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:09,399
I don't know, it's some sort of
emergency announcement or something.

114
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,985
This doesn't make sense.
He should be talking to us.

115
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,822
White House is coming out live.

116
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,159
Good evening, my fellow Americans.

117
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:23,038
I apologize for interrupting
your regular programs...

118
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:26,333
...but I have a very important
announcement to make.

119
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,878
Many important things have happened
to me in my life:

120
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:32,672
My graduation from Princeton...

121
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,509
...the day that Marsha said
she would be my wife...

122
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,762
...the birth of our daughter, Taffy.

123
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:39,971
Thanks, Dad.

124
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,724
And the news that I have heard today...

125
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:45,018
- ...ranks right up there.
- Thank you.

126
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,104
A powerful memory is in the making.

127
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:49,898
Not just for me...

128
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,067
...but for all mankind.

129
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:57,947
Today, an extraordinary discovery
was made by the Hubble telescope.

130
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:02,702
The data from the Hubble was decoded...

131
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,030
...then analyzed
by the most powerful computers at MIT.

132
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,293
The images are undeniable.

133
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:14,297
We are entering the dawn of a new era.

134
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:18,927
Frame enlargements
provide an astonishing sight.

135
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:24,099
A fleet of vehicles,
which can best be described as...

136
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:25,642
...flying saucers.

137
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:29,479
Come on. Come on.
Papa needs a new pair of shoes.

138
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,523
Hey!

139
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,150
Hey, am I the only one
shooting craps here?

140
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:37,737
... we will have
the opportunity to meet with them.

141
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:41,074
I feel this is the perfect summation
to the 20th century....

142
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,284
Martians.

143
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:44,911
This is great.

144
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:48,665
Please come to Earth. Please.

145
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,583
We need you.

146
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,132
I got people coming in.

147
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:00,301
Everybody wants to be a part of this.

148
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:03,346
Galaxy's gonna be world-class.

149
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,140
And soon...

150
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:08,351
...we will become one solar system.

151
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,687
What the hell is he talking about?

152
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:14,315
These flying saucers
have come from the planet Mars...

153
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:17,694
- ...and at their current course and speed....
- Oh. Hey.

154
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:23,450
Listen, Hoss. I've been thinking about
Martians when there wasn't no Martians.

155
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:28,329
It is profoundly moving
to know there is intelligent life out there.

156
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,789
Glad they got it somewhere.

157
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:34,335
And our world will never feel
quite the same again.

158
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:37,297
Good night...

159
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,841
...and God bless you all.

160
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,936
This...

161
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,521
...is intense.

162
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,693
Shut up, Poppy. Shut up.

163
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:01,529
Shut up.

164
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,698
Jason Stone.

165
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,702
It's for you.

166
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:11,414
Poppy, honey. No, sweetie.

167
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:17,212
That's right. Shh. Good girl. Yeah?

168
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,508
Yeah. Well, I could be there at...

169
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,468
...I don't know, 11.

170
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,596
Okay, bye-bye.

171
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,066
Yes?

172
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:42,153
Oh, they want me to go interview
that professor from the White House.

173
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,906
Kessler?

174
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,243
- Donald Kessler?
- Yeah, I think that was his name.

175
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:51,079
You know, the science guy.

176
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,456
This is nuts, this is....

177
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,124
We should have got that guy.

178
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:59,045
Well, I can't help it
if your people are too slow.

179
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:00,255
Right, Poppy?

180
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,282
- Finished!
- One minute, 57 seconds.

181
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:30,952
- Ha-ha! Didn't I tell you under two minutes?
- You did.

182
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,872
You did. I'm so proud of you.

183
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,708
- Hey, Ma, you want a doughnut?
- How old are they?

184
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,001
Fresh-baked Monday.

185
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:41,462
Richie, that's six days ago.

186
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,922
Okay, give me a couple.

187
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:49,095
Hey, this Martian thing
is pretty awesome, huh?

188
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:52,974
Did any one of you traitors
see my Muffy?

189
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,851
Your brother's gonna volunteer.

190
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,145
As soon as I get back to the base.

191
00:14:57,313 --> 00:15:00,106
- Volunteer for what, Billy Glenn?
- Martian detail.

192
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:01,941
- Uh-huh.
- Cool.

193
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:04,110
If any of them Martians
come around here...

194
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,404
...I'm gonna kick their butts.
Heh-heh-heh.

195
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,667
Jump!

196
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,054
Excuse me, folks,
but we gotta make an unscheduled stop.

197
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,351
It's Mama.

198
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:39,687
What are you doing here? Huh?
If you ain't home, why ain't you in class?

199
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:42,398
- Mama, class was canceled.
- Class was not canceled.

200
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:44,150
- Come here. Come here.
- For what?

201
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,069
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Now, come here.

202
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:48,029
Let go of him.

203
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:51,074
Okay. Now, just come here.

204
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,409
Come here.

205
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,536
Think it's smart to cut school?

206
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:58,206
- What are you doing?
- Do you? Do you? Huh? Huh?

207
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,666
- No.
- "No, Mama." It's dumb.

208
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,834
- You're gonna flunk and go to jail.
- No.

209
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:05,421
Get your butt on the bus.
Get on that bus, boy.

210
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:07,715
I'll be tripping all over you.
Get back there.

211
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:10,551
- I don't want to hear another word.
- I hate school.

212
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,637
I heard that.

213
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:36,911
- Hi.
- Hi there.

214
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:40,039
- Want a date?
- How about it?

215
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:41,833
A date?

216
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:44,836
Sounds good.

217
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:49,007
The stress at work is...

218
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,551
...unbelievable.

219
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,266
Mr. Bava, can I speak to you in private?

220
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:01,394
No, I gotta watch the floor.
What do you want, Byron?

221
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:05,023
- I'm supporting my family back East.
- I thought you were divorced.

222
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:08,943
Well, I am,
but I still have to take care of them.

223
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,988
Anyway, look. Things have been
a little lean around here...

224
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,365
...and I was wondering
if I could get a raise?

225
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,452
- Out of the question.
- Mr. Bava, I'm an asset to this hotel.

226
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:20,580
- I mean, they like me around here.
- Byron, you're a nice guy.

227
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:24,709
But I can get Leon Spinks or Buster Douglas
for the same money, maybe less.

228
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:28,421
You better get moving.
You're on in five minutes.

229
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:40,391
This show's gonna get
a hell of a rating.

230
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:41,684
It's all yours, Ian.

231
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:44,771
...language you choose to employ,
and in certain circumstances...

232
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:47,648
...the proposition that two and two
equals five...

233
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:49,650
...is entirely legitimate.

234
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,612
Call me Nathalie.

235
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,990
And you, do please call me Donald.

236
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,577
I've always admired your show.

237
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,873
Really? You like my work?

238
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,167
Yes. Very much.

239
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,086
Why....

240
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,046
Why, thank you.

241
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,881
Coming out of commercial.

242
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:15,968
In five, four, three, two....

243
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:21,015
Welcome back. We're speaking
with Professor Donald Kessler.

244
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:27,396
He's the chairman
of the American Academy of Astronautics.

245
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,440
Professor...

246
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,985
...isn't it weird that we sent
a space probe to Mars...

247
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:34,737
...and we didn't even find anyone?

248
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:38,282
Well, not really, Nathalie...

249
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,536
...because we didn't get into the canals.

250
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,579
The Martian canals are actually canyons.

251
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,040
Some of them are over 100 miles deep.

252
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,876
The Martian civilization
has clearly developed...

253
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:51,420
...under the surface of the planet.

254
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:54,757
Their science and technology
must be absolutely mind-boggling.

255
00:18:56,093 --> 00:19:00,471
So, what, in your view, Donald Kessler...

256
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:04,892
...chairman, are some of the things
that the Martians can teach us, professor?

257
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:10,022
Quite a lot about Mars, I expect, Nathalie.

258
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:14,735
She's flirting with him.

259
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:18,489
Ahem. But seriously,
this is tremendously exciting.

260
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:21,784
Think of it. The knowledge, new ideas.
It's gonna change everything.

261
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,162
And we must be open to it.

262
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,873
Maybe they can tell us
about our universe.

263
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,208
How it started. Where it's going.

264
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:32,378
Perhaps even its purpose.

265
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,755
It's tremendously exciting.

266
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:40,469
This is the most important thing to happen
since Jesus walked in Galilee.

267
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:43,806
Oh, Christ. What's wrong with the picture?

268
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,141
Go to Camera 2!

269
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,642
I can't. It's busted.

270
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,561
Well, then go to 1. Go to 4.

271
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,319
He just copped a feel.

272
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:00,364
Now what?

273
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:14,587
What's that?

274
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:16,797
So that's a Martian.

275
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,427
That's a Martian?

276
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:27,642
- Oh, my God.
- Yikes.

277
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,521
I'm not gonna have that thing
in my house.

278
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:38,611
Sweetie, we may have to. The people
will expect me to meet with them.

279
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:41,197
Well, they're not gonna eat off
the Van Buren china.

280
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,326
Oh, look at that brain.

281
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:46,953
He must be real smart.

282
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,580
It's gross.

283
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:51,666
Don't forget, Nathalie...

284
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,752
...that we will look equally gross to him.

285
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:01,842
Whoa. He made the international sign
of the doughnut.

286
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:05,846
From the limited information available,
I've made three extrapolations.

287
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:09,517
One, our Martian friend
is a carbon-based life form.

288
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:12,019
Two, he breathes nitrogen.

289
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:16,857
And three,
the large cerebrum here indicates...

290
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,859
...telepathic potential.

291
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:22,071
You mean they can read our thoughts?

292
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:27,451
- Potentially, yes.
- What about their intentions?

293
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,161
Are they a friendly people?

294
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:34,709
Logic dictates that given their extremely
high level of technical development...

295
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:36,585
...they're an advanced culture...

296
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:40,464
...therefore, peaceful and enlightened.

297
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,009
The human race, on the other hand...

298
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:46,345
...is an aggressively dangerous species.

299
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:50,141
Now, I suspect they have
more to fear from us...

300
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,852
...than we from them.

301
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,979
- Doctor.
- Thank you, professor.

302
00:21:56,565 --> 00:22:00,234
For many years,
I've been refining a translating computer.

303
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:03,070
The results are not perfect...

304
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:07,033
...but this may answer
some of your questions.

305
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,623
All green of skin...

306
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:17,335
...800 centuries ago.

307
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:21,756
Their bodily fluids
include the birth of half-breeds.

308
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:25,217
- How many centuries did he say?
- Eight hundred, sir.

309
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:27,762
...self-determination of the cosmos.

310
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:34,226
For dark is the suede
that mows like a harvest.

311
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:36,354
What the hell does that mean?

312
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,121
- Hey, Mitch.
- Good morning, miss.

313
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:57,750
I'm sorry, you can't come this way.
There's a tour in progress.

314
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:00,544
Oh.

315
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,719
Hello, my name is Barbara.

316
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:10,638
Hello, Barbara.

317
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:15,142
I am an alcoholic,
but I haven't had a drink in three months.

318
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,312
Thank you.

319
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:25,820
I'm feeling so optimistic
because of the Martians.

320
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:28,739
We're not alone in the universe.

321
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,866
And it's so perfect...

322
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:34,620
...that it's happening at the beginning
of the new millennium.

323
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:41,252
Our planet was suffering
with the ozone and the rain forest...

324
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:45,172
...and so many people
unhappy in their lives.

325
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:51,679
And then the Martians heard
our global karmic cry for help.

326
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,264
People say they're ugly...

327
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:56,392
...but I think they've come
to show us the way.

328
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,688
I think they've come to save us.

329
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:04,817
Thank you.

330
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,539
Bye-bye.

331
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:21,417
You be careful, baby, okay?
Don't get yourself killed.

332
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:22,960
Oh, ain't she cute?

333
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,546
- Son, we're real proud of you.
- Thanks, Dad.

334
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,591
Let me take this.

335
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:30,885
- So long, bro.
- So long, retard.

336
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:34,472
Just don't be touching none of my stuff
while I'm gone.

337
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:37,391
Bye-bye, Grandma.

338
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:38,726
Goodbye, Thomas.

339
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,144
It's Billy Glenn, Grandma.

340
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,439
I know. Thomas. Ha-ha-ha.

341
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:45,733
Bye-bye, honey.

342
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,694
I got to go.

343
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:52,031
All right.

344
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,325
I love you, baby.

345
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,078
Adios.

346
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:03,334
Be careful, boy.

347
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,545
Bye-bye.

348
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:15,179
Well, he'll be all right.

349
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,765
- I hope so.
- Army trains them good.

350
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:25,105
Well, he's gone for a while.

351
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:28,567
Oh, Richie, why can't you be more
like your brother?

352
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:31,278
Darling, we got plumb lucky
with Billy Glenn.

353
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:33,531
Can't expect the same luck twice.

354
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:36,659
Richie, want to make yourself
useful for a change?

355
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:40,287
- Sure, Dad.
- Take Grandma back to the home.

356
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:58,013
Grandma, I bet you never thought you'd
live to see the Martians coming to Earth.

357
00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:00,391
It's pretty far out, huh?

358
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:06,188
Just think of all the crazy stuff
you must have seen in your lifetime.

359
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:09,149
I bet people were pretty scared
when they invented the train.

360
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:12,903
Come on, kid, I'm not that old.

361
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:17,491
Grandma, are you okay?

362
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:20,995
I want to see Slim.

363
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:23,872
I want to see Slim...

364
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:27,710
...and Muffy and Richie.

365
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:31,547
Grandma, I'm Richie.

366
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:35,175
I know, Thomas.

367
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:38,262
Richie was always the best one.

368
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:44,560
The president is talking
to other world leaders.

369
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:49,231
They're preparing a list of issues
of common interest to discuss.

370
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:53,444
There is a unilateral, concerted,
diplomatic effort being made.

371
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,698
- Jason.
- Yeah, Jerry, thanks.

372
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:00,200
If the Martians land,
will the press have access?

373
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:01,493
Can we do interviews?

374
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,746
Well, I mean, that depends.

375
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:06,081
You know,
we'd have to establish contact...

376
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:08,375
...work out whatever
communication problems...

377
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:12,338
...establish a parameter for talks. Then
I guess we just see what happens. Heh-heh.

378
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:13,839
Oh, here's the president.

379
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:20,512
Good morning.
It's nice to see you all again.

380
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:24,350
I just have a few minutes for questions,
so let's get started.

381
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:25,559
Mr. President!

382
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:31,815
Do the Martians have two sexes,
like we do?

383
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:55,089
From Hollywood, we bring
you The Lawrence Welk Show.

384
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:05,265
Now, here he is, Mr. Music-Maker himself,
Lawrence Welk.

385
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:17,236
This pussycat
is the most beautiful pussycat...

386
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:19,780
...in the whole world.

387
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,573
That's my Muffy.

388
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:23,826
Mwah.

389
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:29,123
Richie, didn't you ever have
a pussycat of your own?

390
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,290
Sure, Grandma.

391
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:32,918
Music.

392
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:41,593
- There you go.
- Thank you.

393
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:45,597
Hey, Grandma, you gonna be okay?

394
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,892
If you need anything,
any doughnuts or anything...

395
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,686
...give me a call, all right?

396
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,523
Bye.

397
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:59,987
Will you answer too

398
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:18,088
How do, Byron?

399
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:22,176
Looks like you ain't got no wheels.

400
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:24,762
Come on, get in.

401
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:31,351
I'm gonna do you a favor, Byron.

402
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:36,815
I owe you one. I made a ton of money
on your last fight in '73.

403
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:38,150
The Quaker in Jamaica.

404
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:40,903
Heh. I'm glad somebody did.

405
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,197
Yeah, I know, I know.

406
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:44,740
It's rough on jocks.

407
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:50,329
Get to a certain age,
opportunities dry up.

408
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:52,164
So here's the deal.

409
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:56,418
I got this chump, owes me a lot of money,
needs a wake-up call.

410
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:58,837
What I'd like for you to do is...

411
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:02,883
...use that patented left hook on him.

412
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:05,886
Just in the ring, Art, you know?
Just in the ring.

413
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,722
Yeah, I'm hip, I'm hip...

414
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:11,266
...but I'll give you two grand.

415
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,685
When you're done...

416
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:17,856
...all you gotta do is mosey on by the office
and pick up the cash.

417
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:20,234
Why you wanna come at me
that way, Art?

418
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:22,694
You know I'm trying to
get back with my wife.

419
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:26,073
We used to have problems
with that same kind of shit.

420
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,033
I've changed, man.

421
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:32,120
I found Allah, I don't eat pork,
and I'm a better man.

422
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:36,667
I faced that demon.
I don't want him coming out again.

423
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:40,295
You gave up pork.

424
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:50,305
General, they're sending coordinates.

425
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:58,897
- Where are they landing?
- Pahrump. It's in the Nevada desert.

426
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:02,276
Yes, sir. I can have my troops there
at 0800 hours, sir.

427
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:05,946
Mr. President, we must not send
these people the wrong message.

428
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:08,115
We need a welcome mat,
not a row of tanks.

429
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,950
What the hell are you talking about?

430
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:13,412
You can't have Martians
running all over Nevada!

431
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,455
- You're right, general.
- Thank you, sir.

432
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:17,583
The situation needs to be supervised.

433
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,251
Absolutely, sir.

434
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:21,128
General Casey...

435
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:23,130
...you think you can handle it?

436
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:24,298
I'd be proud.

437
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:26,633
Good, but keep a lid on it.

438
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:30,762
Key media, good cross-section of guests.

439
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:33,098
We don't want it
to turn into a zoo out there.

440
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,975
Yes, sir.

441
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:45,485
They don't know what the hell
they're talking about.

442
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:47,779
Liberals, intellectuals...

443
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:50,824
...peacemongers, idiots!

444
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:54,286
Would you please keep it down?

445
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:56,663
People live here.

446
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:21,271
General Casey.

447
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:26,652
Yes, I get to greet the Martian ambassador.

448
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:28,320
Isn't that great?

449
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:31,698
Oh, it's a hell of an honor.

450
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:33,659
But didn't I always tell you, honey...

451
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:36,370
...if I just stayed in place
and never spoke up...

452
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:39,122
...good things were bound to happen?

453
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,625
Yeah. Okay.

454
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:49,484
I want the Martians to be treated
like foreign dignitaries.

455
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:52,279
I want your men alert and majestic...

456
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:55,449
...with a snap in their step.

457
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:58,702
This has got to look good.
The whole world is watching.

458
00:33:58,870 --> 00:33:59,911
Yes, sir.

459
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,419
Are you positive
this thing is gonna work?

460
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,422
Positively positive.

461
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,049
We don't want any slip-ups.

462
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:14,342
No, no, no. Not at all. No.

463
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:39,367
Hey, Poppy. All these people...

464
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:42,162
...all of them here to see you.

465
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:43,997
Mm-mwah.

466
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,458
There's Jason, Poppy.

467
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,376
Hi, Jason!

468
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:51,546
Hi.

469
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,799
Jason.

470
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,301
Hi. Yoo-hoo.

471
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,348
All right, let's go.

472
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:05,936
The teeming masses have gathered
from who knows how many states...

473
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:09,815
...waiting and watching.
Why have they come?

474
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,609
Curiosity? Or is it something more?

475
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:15,445
Or is it simply to say, "I was there"?

476
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:18,657
"I was there when first man...

477
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:21,159
...met Martian."

478
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:24,955
Jason Stone, GNN, Pahrump.

479
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:01,783
Give them room.
That's it. Give them room.

480
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:55,295
It is an awesome sight.

481
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:58,173
The giant spacecraft glinting...

482
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:03,386
...in the Nevada sun like a giant...

483
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:05,430
...hubcap.

484
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:07,974
Something's happening.

485
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:16,566
Doorway is opening.

486
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:24,950
A silver ramp is coming out...

487
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:30,038
...like a giant tongue. Oh.

488
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,937
Gee whiz.

489
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:14,374
Rusty. Shh.

490
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:22,549
Martians.

491
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:25,510
Funny little critters, ain't they?

492
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:05,842
Well?

493
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,219
Wait a moment.

494
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:14,976
Greetings. I am the Martian ambassador.

495
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:20,190
Everything is fixed now, general.
You may speak.

496
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:23,318
Greetings. I am General Casey...

497
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:28,156
...commanding officer of the armed forces
of the United States of America.

498
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:32,202
On behalf of the people of Earth,
welcome.

499
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:34,412
He did that well.

500
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:07,153
We come in peace.

501
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:10,657
We come in peace. We come in peace.

502
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:16,621
They came in peace.

503
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:21,376
We come in peace.

504
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:53,241
Open fire!

505
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:15,221
Whoa!

506
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:24,606
What the hell is this?

507
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:31,821
Nathalie!

508
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:17,200
Die, you alien shithead!

509
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:22,163
Uh-oh.

510
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:24,374
I surrender.

511
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:34,634
No, that ain't happening.
That didn't happen.

512
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:50,066
Nathalie.

513
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:53,653
Aah!

514
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,527
Holy mother of God.

515
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:35,820
Did you see that?

516
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:38,615
We should hit these assholes
with everything we got, sir.

517
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:41,409
Sir, Mr. President,
I know this seems terrible...

518
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:43,620
...but let's not be too rash.

519
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:45,705
We should nuke them now, sir.

520
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:48,541
We must establish
a line of communication first.

521
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:51,002
Why not set up a town hall?

522
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,463
We can get the public's opinion.

523
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:56,841
What do you think, Marsha?

524
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:00,303
Kick the crap out of them.

525
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:03,431
Ladies and gentlemen...

526
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,767
...this could be
a cultural misunderstanding.

527
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:08,561
Yeah. Maybe to them, doves mean war.

528
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:14,108
We all saw how they reacted
to that dove.

529
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:16,027
It frightened them.

530
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:18,571
He did say that...

531
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:22,742
... "We come in peace."

532
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:25,578
Yes.

533
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:34,462
The new computer's ready,
Mr. President.

534
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:36,631
Okay, let's do it.

535
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:39,884
I know we're making the right decision.

536
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:44,430
Ready to transmit.

537
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:50,061
This is the president
of the United States.

538
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:52,563
I'm speaking to you in the hope...

539
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:55,817
...that what happened earlier today
in the Nevada desert...

540
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:59,946
...was a cultural misunderstanding.

541
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:02,990
There can be no doubt
that we two peoples...

542
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:06,452
...have a great deal to offer one another.

543
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:08,830
You must be as excited as we...

544
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:12,208
...to find intelligent life
in the solar system.

545
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:15,294
And let me make it clear:

546
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:19,424
You have nothing to fear from us.

547
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:22,719
Our customs may be strange to you...

548
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:26,806
...but we mean no harm.

549
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:40,254
When the investors fly in...

550
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:47,094
...I would like for them each
to be met by a limo.

551
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:50,181
Top-of-the-line cars...

552
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:52,892
...leather interiors...

553
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,186
...Corinthian, if they got it.

554
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:59,816
Art, are you still spinning your wheels
on that cockamamie hotel?

555
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:02,527
- Whoa.
- Hello.

556
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:05,404
The Martians have attacked.

557
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:09,617
This was no misunderstanding.
I was there. I saw it.

558
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:11,994
Look, you're worried about yesterday.

559
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:14,580
But I'm worried about tomorrow.

560
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:18,251
The Martians land on Earth,
they're gonna need a place to stay.

561
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:19,877
Just like everybody else.

562
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:22,505
My God.

563
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:26,717
Maybe we should all be destroyed.

564
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:30,805
The human race doesn't deserve to live.

565
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:40,356
Ethel, that reminds me.

566
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:43,150
I would like for every limo to be stocked...

567
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:46,612
...with every kind of alcohol
known to man.

568
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:51,868
And top it off
with a bottle of Dom on ice.

569
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:55,413
What confounds me most of all,
gentlemen, is the lack of genitalia.

570
00:47:55,581 --> 00:48:00,376
And of course down here we have the aorta.
Up here we have the sphinx.

571
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:03,713
Notice the highly developed
cranial nerve system here.

572
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:07,341
This explains, of course,
the cerebral arteries.

573
00:48:07,509 --> 00:48:11,971
And if we notice down here,
behind the optic chiasm...

574
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:13,723
...several glands....

575
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:20,479
Very curious.

576
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:07,443
He who believes in me,
though he die, yet shall he live.

577
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:11,906
And whoever lives and believes in me
shall never die.

578
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:16,202
Billy Glenn Norris gave his life
defending our country.

579
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:17,620
Why did it have to be him?

580
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:20,247
Billy Glenn Norris is a true American hero.

581
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:23,000
May God rest his soul.

582
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:27,046
Ready. Aim.

583
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:29,131
Fire.

584
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:32,176
Aim. Fire.

585
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,639
Aim. Fire.

586
00:49:44,898 --> 00:49:46,190
Hello?

587
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:49,568
Byron. Is everything all right?
You still coming tomorrow?

588
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:53,280
You just try and stop me.
That plane arrives at 4 p.m.

589
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:56,575
- Are the kids there?
- Yeah, hold on.

590
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:58,953
Cedric. Neville.

591
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:02,790
- Me first.
- No, me.

592
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:07,420
- Hey, Dad.
- Who's that? Neville?

593
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:09,463
- Yeah.
- How you doing?

594
00:50:09,631 --> 00:50:13,092
- We're going to the White House.
- You're going to the White House?

595
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,552
Yeah, tomorrow.

596
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,054
- Man, give it back.
- Leave me alone.

597
00:50:17,222 --> 00:50:19,223
It's a school thing, like a tour.

598
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:22,309
So that means you're still going to school
once in a while?

599
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:23,644
Yeah.

600
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:27,481
- Give me your ma again, all right?
- All right. Hold on. Mom.

601
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:30,818
- You always get to the phone first.
- So what?

602
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:33,112
Well, I'm first to the game.

603
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:37,616
What are you wasting this phone time for?
We're gonna see you tomorrow.

604
00:50:37,784 --> 00:50:40,453
Yeah, but there's something
I want to say to you.

605
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,955
Just because I feel like saying it,
all right?

606
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:44,290
Yeah, what's that?

607
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:46,500
I love you.

608
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:50,379
I love you too, Byron.

609
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:53,466
Now stop wasting money.
I'll see you tomorrow.

610
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:12,777
They're responding.

611
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:18,199
A message from the Martians.

612
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:21,994
- Really?
- They've issued a formal apology.

613
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:27,374
This is great.

614
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:29,960
Didn't I tell you this would happen?

615
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:34,256
The Martian ambassador feels terrible
and asked permission to speak to Congress.

616
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:36,050
I mean, that's good, isn't it?

617
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:38,177
You bet.

618
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:40,679
It's a great victory for our administration.

619
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:56,547
Ladies and gentlemen.

620
00:52:57,215 --> 00:53:00,092
This is a proud day for all Americans.

621
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:04,388
This is a hell of a photo op, Jerry.

622
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:06,765
Are you sure I shouldn't be there?

623
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:10,728
For some picky reason, the Secret Service
don't want the executive branch...

624
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:14,815
...and the legislative branch
in the same room at the same time.

625
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:17,902
The Martian ambassador
is gonna say a few words.

626
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:20,946
Come on down, Mr. Ambassador.

627
00:54:27,555 --> 00:54:28,681
Oh.

628
00:54:28,848 --> 00:54:31,016
Mr. Ambassador, please!

629
00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:39,441
Mr. Ambassador. What are you doing?
This doesn't make sense!

630
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:41,694
It's not logical! It's not...

631
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:45,197
Guess it wasn't the dove.

632
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:48,993
Fire!

633
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:55,541
They blew up Congress.

634
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:20,316
What did they do that for?

635
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:23,485
Maybe they don't liking
the human being.

636
00:55:41,379 --> 00:55:42,755
Hello, gentlemen.

637
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:47,092
Nice of you to come
on such short notice.

638
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:52,097
General Decker,
it seems I owe you an apology.

639
00:55:52,265 --> 00:55:55,017
Hey, we all make mistakes,
Mr. President.

640
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:57,269
Not anymore.

641
00:55:57,812 --> 00:56:00,647
We're going to take charge of this thing.

642
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:02,900
Excellent, sir. I have prepared the order.

643
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:05,110
What's this?

644
00:56:05,278 --> 00:56:09,573
Oh, that's your executive order authorizing
full use of our nuclear deterrent, sir.

645
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:14,787
Are you out of your mind?
I'm not going to start a war.

646
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:16,455
We're already at war, sir.

647
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:18,874
We have to nuke them.
We have to nuke them now!

648
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:24,004
General Decker, if you do not shut up...

649
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:26,382
...I'm going to relieve you
of your command.

650
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:28,384
We have to strike now, sir.

651
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:30,969
Annihilate. Kill! Kill! Kill!

652
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:34,765
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

653
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:01,875
Now...

654
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:05,462
...I want the people to know...

655
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:10,008
...that they still have two out of three
branches of government working for them...

656
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:11,885
...and that ain't bad.

657
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:17,349
I want the people to know
that the schools will still be open, okay?

658
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:19,852
And I want the people to know...

659
00:57:20,019 --> 00:57:23,147
...that the garbage
will still be carried out.

660
00:57:23,314 --> 00:57:26,483
And I want a cop on every corner.

661
00:57:26,651 --> 00:57:28,569
Which, incidentally...

662
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:31,071
...we would already have...

663
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:34,575
...if they had listened to me
in the last election.

664
00:57:37,328 --> 00:57:38,745
Jerry...

665
00:57:38,913 --> 00:57:40,998
...how soon can we go on the air?

666
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:45,544
Uh....

667
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,423
My fellow Americans...

668
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:51,633
...it is with a heavy heart...

669
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:55,637
...that I speak to you this afternoon.
As you know...

670
00:57:55,805 --> 00:58:00,767
...earlier today the Martian ambassador
and his confederates...

671
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:07,524
...attacked and killed many
of your representatives on Capitol Hill.

672
00:58:07,692 --> 00:58:11,653
I will be conferring with other world leaders
as time goes on.

673
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:17,201
And rest assured that,
working together...

674
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:20,704
...we will soon come out...

675
00:58:20,872 --> 00:58:24,875
...at a very real outcome.

676
00:58:26,252 --> 00:58:27,794
Thank you.

677
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:36,261
Hmm.

678
00:58:51,277 --> 00:58:52,694
Oh.

679
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:56,281
Nathalie?

680
00:58:56,741 --> 00:58:58,825
Nathalie, is that you?

681
00:58:58,993 --> 00:59:01,620
Yes. How are you feeling?

682
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:06,208
Not terribly good, I'm afraid.

683
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:09,378
May I ask you a question?

684
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:13,799
Mm. Yes.
Yes, of course you can, Nathalie.

685
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:17,636
Were you flirting with me on the show?

686
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:20,472
Because if you were...

687
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:24,643
...I just want you to know that I liked it.

688
00:59:24,852 --> 00:59:28,063
Ha-ha. You did? Really?

689
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:31,483
Because, you know,
I've watched you on TV quite a bit...

690
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:36,780
...and, well, I've had something
of a schoolboy crush on you for...

691
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:39,992
...oh, gosh, ages.

692
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:24,369
Hi there.
Are you interested in the White House?

693
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:31,918
I work there. I'm the press secretary.

694
01:00:32,086 --> 01:00:33,253
My name's Jerry Ross.

695
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:36,506
Maybe you've heard of me?

696
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:40,510
You wouldn't believe
the pressure of my job.

697
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:44,097
It's nice to see a new face.

698
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:53,273
Hey, are you doing anything?

699
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:57,486
Because if you want,
I could give you a personalized tour.

700
01:00:57,862 --> 01:00:59,613
Would you like that?

701
01:01:01,783 --> 01:01:05,285
Hey, Mitch, it's me. Can you let me in?

702
01:01:08,706 --> 01:01:10,707
Oh, hello, Mr. Ross. Sure.

703
01:01:10,875 --> 01:01:13,293
We're a little nervous here,
after what happened.

704
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:15,170
Exactly.

705
01:01:24,097 --> 01:01:27,432
Many great men and women
have passed through here.

706
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:30,143
Now we're passing through here.

707
01:01:30,311 --> 01:01:32,062
Feels good, don't it?

708
01:01:35,608 --> 01:01:37,901
You're very graceful.

709
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:39,444
I like that.

710
01:01:47,286 --> 01:01:48,620
Come here.

711
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:11,309
We call this the Kennedy Room.

712
01:02:15,356 --> 01:02:17,274
Pretty nifty, huh?

713
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:52,851
So how's about a drink?

714
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:25,217
Ah. Getting more comfortable, I see.

715
01:03:27,553 --> 01:03:29,513
Outstanding.

716
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:45,070
How's my lady doing?

717
01:03:55,414 --> 01:03:58,166
Oh, missy, you're hot.

718
01:03:58,334 --> 01:04:00,961
But could we get that gum
out of your mouth?

719
01:04:03,881 --> 01:04:05,340
Oh!

720
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:08,552
My finger!

721
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:16,601
Hello? Hello, operator?
Operator, this is an emergency!

722
01:04:16,769 --> 01:04:18,854
Help! Please!

723
01:05:43,981 --> 01:05:45,357
Don't shoot.

724
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:50,612
Don't worry, darling.

725
01:05:59,538 --> 01:06:00,622
Get down!

726
01:06:11,425 --> 01:06:13,635
- Thank you, Mitch.
- It's my job.

727
01:06:14,136 --> 01:06:16,429
Jimmy. Aah! Jimmy.

728
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:09,524
What's happening?

729
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:15,405
They appear to be in a highly agitated state,
Nathalie. And I don't know.

730
01:07:16,073 --> 01:07:17,532
I honestly don't know, Nathalie.

731
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:20,577
I don't know what's going on anymore.
This is frustrating.

732
01:07:20,745 --> 01:07:24,873
I'm just not feeling myself. Nathalie,
if only I could hold you in my arms.

733
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:28,501
Oh, Donald. I'm scared.

734
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:04,704
Excuse me.
But you said you wanted to know...

735
01:08:04,872 --> 01:08:06,956
...as soon as we had an analysis
of the gum.

736
01:08:07,124 --> 01:08:09,292
- What is it?
- It's NO2.

737
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:11,002
Highly concentrated.

738
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:13,004
Nitrogen.

739
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:17,675
So that's how it could breathe
in our atmosphere.

740
01:08:19,011 --> 01:08:20,512
What's that noise?

741
01:08:52,711 --> 01:08:55,547
Theodore, I simply do not feel
that Lincoln....

742
01:08:56,048 --> 01:09:00,051
It's a full-scale invasion. Mr. President,
we're gonna need to get you to safety.

743
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:06,683
Can we go this way?

744
01:09:06,851 --> 01:09:09,686
Sorry, ma'am.
There's a tour going through here.

745
01:09:09,854 --> 01:09:11,813
The Blue Room is often considered...

746
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:13,815
...the most beautiful room
in the White House.

747
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:17,110
In fact, it is often used by the president
to receive guests.

748
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:19,529
It is furnished to represent the period
of James Monroe.

749
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:22,740
Hey, what's that?

750
01:09:22,908 --> 01:09:26,786
That is a portrait of James Monroe.

751
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:42,552
Go, go!

752
01:10:18,797 --> 01:10:20,173
- We lost Taffy.
- Oh, no.

753
01:10:24,637 --> 01:10:28,348
Mr. President, please. Keep moving.
We have to get you to the back stairs!

754
01:10:34,939 --> 01:10:36,439
The Nancy Reagan chandelier.

755
01:10:39,026 --> 01:10:40,485
Marsha!

756
01:10:42,571 --> 01:10:43,571
Marsha!

757
01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:50,370
Marsha?

758
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:58,836
What are you guys gawking at?
Get that president out of here!

759
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:07,136
And I personally guarantee...

760
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:10,056
...that you will get a complete return
on your investment...

761
01:11:11,684 --> 01:11:13,309
...within five months.

762
01:11:13,477 --> 01:11:15,186
Mr. Land, excuse me, please.

763
01:11:15,354 --> 01:11:19,315
Just a second, Sheik Rakmula.

764
01:11:20,734 --> 01:11:26,739
Now, even in a time of so-called
intergalactic emergency...

765
01:11:26,907 --> 01:11:31,995
...the people still wanna roll
them bones.

766
01:11:32,705 --> 01:11:34,414
Mr. Land. I believe...

767
01:11:34,581 --> 01:11:36,499
Just five more minutes, Quinn.

768
01:11:37,334 --> 01:11:39,419
What I would like
for you gentlemen to do...

769
01:11:39,586 --> 01:11:44,966
...is to view our brand-new,
state-of-the-art show room.

770
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:47,719
It is out of sight.

771
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:51,222
Gentlemen.

772
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:57,937
There is no way that we can lose.

773
01:12:01,191 --> 01:12:02,233
Whoa!

774
01:12:43,442 --> 01:12:48,613
It's not unusual to be loved by anyone

775
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:53,785
It's not unusual to have fun with anyone

776
01:12:53,952 --> 01:12:58,456
But when I see you hanging about
With anyone

777
01:12:59,124 --> 01:13:03,669
It's not unusual to see me cry

778
01:13:03,837 --> 01:13:06,422
I wanna die

779
01:13:06,757 --> 01:13:09,967
I've been trying to call you all day.
The flight's been canceled.

780
01:13:10,135 --> 01:13:12,512
Byron, there's Martians everywhere.

781
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:15,890
- Hello?
- Byron! Byron!

782
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:18,851
- I can't hear you!
- Byron!

783
01:13:23,357 --> 01:13:24,732
I gotta get to Washington.

784
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:27,151
Byron?

785
01:13:28,362 --> 01:13:31,864
Byron? Byron.
Do you know anyone who can fly a plane?

786
01:13:32,032 --> 01:13:34,117
- Yeah, your husband, Art.
- No, he's dead.

787
01:13:34,284 --> 01:13:38,121
I told him this was gonna happen.
I even loaded a plane with supplies.

788
01:13:38,288 --> 01:13:42,708
I want to go to Tahoe, to the Tahoe caves.
It's remote, the Martians won't find it.

789
01:13:42,876 --> 01:13:44,085
Well, where's the plane?

790
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:47,004
Private airfield.
Other side of the freeway.

791
01:13:47,172 --> 01:13:50,925
- You think they'll fly to Washington, D.C.?
- Why? I wanna go to Tahoe.

792
01:13:51,593 --> 01:13:55,763
You'll find it happens
All the time

793
01:13:55,931 --> 01:14:01,519
Love would never do
What you want it to

794
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:03,855
Why can't this crazy love

795
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:08,818
Be mine

796
01:14:15,367 --> 01:14:16,492
Jesus Christ.

797
01:14:25,752 --> 01:14:27,879
Girls, get out! Get out!

798
01:14:30,424 --> 01:14:32,467
Get out! Get out!

799
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:38,389
There's a Martian right behind me.

800
01:14:38,557 --> 01:14:40,391
Hey, you're Tom Jones, right?

801
01:14:40,726 --> 01:14:42,226
It ain't unusual

802
01:14:42,394 --> 01:14:44,729
Tom, Tom, can I have an autograph?
Anybody got a pen?

803
01:15:04,249 --> 01:15:07,043
- Hey, that was a hell of a punch.
- You'd better get that gun.

804
01:15:07,211 --> 01:15:08,920
- I'm Tom Jones.
- Byron Williams.

805
01:15:09,087 --> 01:15:11,088
Hey, I saw you fight
in Cardiff, Wales once.

806
01:15:11,256 --> 01:15:12,715
- Yeah? Hey, Barbara.
- Yeah?

807
01:15:12,883 --> 01:15:14,133
You all right?

808
01:15:14,301 --> 01:15:16,427
- I need a drink.
- You and me both, baby.

809
01:15:16,595 --> 01:15:18,888
- We better get out.
- You know how to fly a plane?

810
01:15:19,056 --> 01:15:20,806
- Sure. You got one?
- She has.

811
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:43,079
Don't run, we are your friends.

812
01:16:14,194 --> 01:16:16,571
- Martians blew up the shop.
- You're kidding me?

813
01:16:16,738 --> 01:16:18,614
- Should I get Grandma?
- Forget Grandma.

814
01:16:18,782 --> 01:16:21,450
She's halfway to outer space already.
Here, lock and load.

815
01:16:21,618 --> 01:16:24,787
I'll tell you one thing.
They ain't getting the TV.

816
01:16:28,667 --> 01:16:31,669
The president of France on line two.

817
01:16:35,007 --> 01:16:38,509
Mr. President, the president of France
is on line two.

818
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:40,678
He says it's important.

819
01:16:46,059 --> 01:16:48,227
Hello, Maurice.

820
01:16:51,315 --> 01:16:54,025
I have some good news for you.
The Martian ambassador is here.

821
01:16:54,192 --> 01:16:57,194
And we've negotiated a settlement.

822
01:16:58,697 --> 01:17:01,699
Maurice, get out of the room.
Get out now.

823
01:17:48,205 --> 01:17:49,288
Mr. President.

824
01:17:51,917 --> 01:17:53,626
Mr. President.

825
01:17:53,794 --> 01:17:56,462
I need you to sign this.

826
01:18:01,259 --> 01:18:02,510
What is it?

827
01:18:02,678 --> 01:18:05,137
My last will and testament?

828
01:18:05,305 --> 01:18:09,266
It is an order to deploy
our nuclear capability, sir.

829
01:18:17,150 --> 01:18:21,821
Three, two, one, fire.

830
01:19:21,339 --> 01:19:23,007
What the hell was that?

831
01:21:05,026 --> 01:21:06,068
Look!

832
01:21:13,952 --> 01:21:15,494
What was that?

833
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:19,164
- Where you going?
- To go get Grandma.

834
01:21:19,332 --> 01:21:21,333
No, you ain't.
Stay and defend this trailer.

835
01:21:21,501 --> 01:21:23,502
That's what Billy Glenn would've done.

836
01:21:23,670 --> 01:21:27,339
- You leave, you're disgracing a hero.
- I don't care. I'm gonna go get Grandma.

837
01:21:27,507 --> 01:21:30,509
- Boy!
- Richie, come back here!

838
01:21:43,189 --> 01:21:44,565
What in the hell is that?

839
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:53,949
Hey! Cut it out!

840
01:21:59,497 --> 01:22:00,623
Stop it!

841
01:22:09,633 --> 01:22:11,008
- This way.
- No, this way.

842
01:22:13,303 --> 01:22:16,388
Bullshit! The airfield's over there!

843
01:22:21,144 --> 01:22:24,146
Hey. Hey, just because
you're dressed like King Tut...

844
01:22:24,314 --> 01:22:27,524
...doesn't mean you're our leader.
Look at this. This is wrong!

845
01:22:27,692 --> 01:22:31,111
We're lost. He led us down a maze.
I'm going back to the hotel.

846
01:22:31,279 --> 01:22:33,030
- Come on, this way!
- Wait!

847
01:22:33,198 --> 01:22:36,367
- No, wait! Where are you going?
- Come on, Barbara.

848
01:22:36,534 --> 01:22:38,786
I like him. I do.

849
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:48,003
Assholes. Why did I listen to them?
I should have stayed in the hotel.

850
01:22:48,546 --> 01:22:50,047
Shit!

851
01:22:52,926 --> 01:22:54,343
I surrender, okay?

852
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:57,096
You understand what that means?
Surrender?

853
01:22:58,598 --> 01:23:00,975
Lookit. You're intelligent beings.

854
01:23:01,685 --> 01:23:03,852
Let's cut a deal. I can help you.

855
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:05,771
I'm a lawyer.

856
01:23:05,939 --> 01:23:09,191
You want to conquer the world,
you're gonna need lawyers, right?

857
01:23:10,819 --> 01:23:12,653
Here.

858
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:14,989
You want my watch?

859
01:23:15,156 --> 01:23:17,491
Take it. Take it. Go on. It's a Rolex.

860
01:23:18,743 --> 01:23:20,869
Rolex.

861
01:23:28,294 --> 01:23:31,088
- Nice shot.
- Yeah, pity I was too late.

862
01:23:31,256 --> 01:23:35,259
Barbara, can I have the gun back, please?
Barbara, give me the gun and come on!

863
01:24:50,043 --> 01:24:51,502
Grandma!

864
01:24:59,177 --> 01:25:00,636
Oh, my God.

865
01:25:10,897 --> 01:25:12,856
When I'm calling you

866
01:25:13,024 --> 01:25:17,111
Richie, I think these guys are very sick.

867
01:25:18,154 --> 01:25:21,406
What's happening to them?
What's killing them?

868
01:25:22,242 --> 01:25:24,535
I think it must be my music.

869
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:30,415
Ho! Shh! Shh.

870
01:25:32,585 --> 01:25:33,919
Quiet.

871
01:26:25,471 --> 01:26:27,890
You think you can do anything you want.

872
01:26:28,057 --> 01:26:29,433
Well, you can't.

873
01:26:29,601 --> 01:26:34,146
You see, because we are human beings.

874
01:26:34,314 --> 01:26:38,692
And we have the United States Army...

875
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:44,531
...that'll fight you to the last man.
And we'll never surrender.

876
01:26:48,786 --> 01:26:49,953
Do you hear me?

877
01:26:50,121 --> 01:26:52,998
We'll fight you on the beaches.
We'll fight you on the street.

878
01:26:53,166 --> 01:26:55,667
We will never, never surrender.

879
01:26:55,835 --> 01:27:00,214
Old Glory will win!
Democracy will survive!

880
01:27:00,381 --> 01:27:04,051
We will never, ever surrender!

881
01:27:04,219 --> 01:27:08,597
We will win!
The eagle will be triumphant!

882
01:27:10,475 --> 01:27:11,892
No.

883
01:27:37,669 --> 01:27:41,880
Why are you doing this?

884
01:27:43,341 --> 01:27:44,925
Why?

885
01:27:45,802 --> 01:27:48,971
Isn’t the universe big enough...

886
01:27:49,138 --> 01:27:51,265
...for both of us?

887
01:27:54,727 --> 01:27:56,937
What is wrong with you people?

888
01:27:59,816 --> 01:28:01,817
We could work together.

889
01:28:02,694 --> 01:28:04,736
Why be enemies?

890
01:28:05,863 --> 01:28:07,698
Because we're different?

891
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:10,200
Is that why?

892
01:28:14,539 --> 01:28:17,291
Think of the things that we could do.

893
01:28:18,626 --> 01:28:21,837
Think how strong we would be.

894
01:28:23,339 --> 01:28:25,382
Earth...

895
01:28:25,550 --> 01:28:27,801
...and Mars...

896
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:29,761
...together.

897
01:28:32,557 --> 01:28:35,892
There is nothing
that we could not accomplish.

898
01:28:36,352 --> 01:28:38,228
Think about it.

899
01:28:40,148 --> 01:28:42,190
Think about it.

900
01:28:43,735 --> 01:28:45,193
Why destroy...

901
01:28:45,903 --> 01:28:48,238
...when you can create?

902
01:28:49,699 --> 01:28:51,992
We can have it all...

903
01:28:52,285 --> 01:28:55,871
...or we can smash it all.

904
01:28:58,291 --> 01:29:02,627
Why can't we work out our differences?

905
01:29:03,504 --> 01:29:08,383
Why can't we work things out?

906
01:29:10,636 --> 01:29:12,971
Little people...

907
01:29:15,099 --> 01:29:20,270
...why can't we all just get along?

908
01:29:46,964 --> 01:29:48,715
What's this?

909
01:30:26,337 --> 01:30:29,005
Don't run. We are your friends.

910
01:30:30,883 --> 01:30:33,260
Don't run. We are your friends.

911
01:30:46,858 --> 01:30:48,984
Next stop, radio station.

912
01:30:51,529 --> 01:30:53,363
There it is.

913
01:30:53,698 --> 01:30:55,115
Let's move it!

914
01:31:13,134 --> 01:31:14,759
Here it is.

915
01:31:15,887 --> 01:31:17,721
Go get it started.
Barbara, go with him.

916
01:31:17,889 --> 01:31:20,056
- Okay.
- Cindy, come with me.

917
01:31:35,448 --> 01:31:38,325
Tom. Are you sure you can fly this?

918
01:31:38,493 --> 01:31:40,577
Yeah, I think so, yeah.

919
01:31:43,122 --> 01:31:44,498
Who put that on?

920
01:31:45,416 --> 01:31:48,502
- It's stuck.
- Cindy, over here.

921
01:31:55,009 --> 01:31:56,801
Shit.

922
01:31:56,969 --> 01:31:59,137
They haven't seen us yet. Come here.

923
01:32:00,056 --> 01:32:02,849
- Cindy. Get in the plane.
- What?

924
01:32:03,017 --> 01:32:04,809
I'm staying. I'll distract them.

925
01:32:04,977 --> 01:32:07,187
The first chance you get, you take off.

926
01:32:07,355 --> 01:32:09,856
- I'm not leaving you.
- Just do it.

927
01:32:10,024 --> 01:32:11,608
I'll draw them away. Now, go.

928
01:32:11,776 --> 01:32:14,444
- No.
- I said, go!

929
01:32:19,450 --> 01:32:21,034
Oh, my God.

930
01:32:21,953 --> 01:32:24,079
- What's he doing?
- He must have flipped!

931
01:32:24,247 --> 01:32:27,290
- He's going to throw them off.
- Yeah, but we can't leave him.

932
01:32:30,878 --> 01:32:34,297
No weapon. No clown outfit.

933
01:32:34,465 --> 01:32:36,299
Just me!

934
01:32:36,467 --> 01:32:38,468
Byron Williams...

935
01:32:38,636 --> 01:32:40,679
...heavyweight champion...

936
01:32:41,472 --> 01:32:43,139
...of the world.

937
01:33:53,919 --> 01:33:55,962
Something's happened.

938
01:33:56,130 --> 01:33:58,214
Something's happened to Byron.

939
01:34:15,024 --> 01:34:17,859
When I'm calling you

940
01:34:27,953 --> 01:34:30,080
Will you answer too

941
01:34:39,090 --> 01:34:43,927
That means I offer my love

942
01:35:02,780 --> 01:35:06,074
Our love will come true

943
01:35:08,994 --> 01:35:12,080
You belong to me

944
01:35:12,248 --> 01:35:18,628
I belong to you

945
01:35:20,631 --> 01:35:23,883
Goodbye, my darling.
I wish things could've been different.

946
01:35:24,051 --> 01:35:25,593
So do I.

947
01:35:31,308 --> 01:35:32,809
Goodbye.

948
01:35:32,977 --> 01:35:36,438
- I love you.
- I love you too, Nathalie.

949
01:37:11,951 --> 01:37:13,368
Florence Norris...

950
01:37:13,536 --> 01:37:16,538
...I hereby present to you
the Congressional Medal of Honor...

951
01:37:16,705 --> 01:37:19,082
...the highest decoration
our nation can bestow.

952
01:37:21,085 --> 01:37:24,546
Thank you, honey.
But don't you dare let this happen again.

953
01:37:26,131 --> 01:37:27,841
Richard Norris...

954
01:37:28,008 --> 01:37:31,219
...on behalf of my parents,
who couldn't be here today...

955
01:37:31,387 --> 01:37:33,596
...for saving the world
from the Martians...

956
01:37:33,764 --> 01:37:36,599
...I proudly present to you
the Medal of Honor.

957
01:37:36,767 --> 01:37:38,935
You don't have to kiss me
if you don't want to.

958
01:37:39,728 --> 01:37:41,521
I have to.

959
01:37:44,233 --> 01:37:46,484
I prepared a speech. Is that all right?

960
01:37:47,570 --> 01:37:49,320
Sure, that's very appropriate.

961
01:37:54,201 --> 01:37:56,077
Hi, everybody.

962
01:37:56,912 --> 01:37:58,288
First, I just want to say...

963
01:37:58,455 --> 01:38:01,291
Can you speak up? We can't hear you.

964
01:38:01,458 --> 01:38:04,627
Well, I want to say that there's
a lot of people in the world...

965
01:38:04,795 --> 01:38:07,255
...that have, like,
done a lot more than I have...

966
01:38:07,423 --> 01:38:12,302
...and they're the ones
that should be here now getting a medal.

967
01:38:13,637 --> 01:38:18,224
And I want to thank my grandma
for always being so good to me...

968
01:38:18,392 --> 01:38:22,270
...and for helping save the world
and everything.

969
01:38:22,438 --> 01:38:25,815
So I guess, like, now we just have to...

970
01:38:25,983 --> 01:38:29,986
...start over and start rebuilding everything,
like our houses.

971
01:38:30,154 --> 01:38:33,907
But I was thinking, maybe instead
of houses, we could live in tepees...

972
01:38:34,074 --> 01:38:37,827
...because it's better in a lot of ways.

973
01:38:41,290 --> 01:38:44,292
Okay, that's all I have to say. Thanks.

974
01:38:46,003 --> 01:38:48,880
- Was that okay?
- Yeah.

975
01:38:49,048 --> 01:38:50,798
Do you got a girlfriend?

976
01:38:50,966 --> 01:38:52,550
No.

977
01:38:53,302 --> 01:38:56,804
Guys, come on. Give me a break.
Go on in there and start cleaning your room.

978
01:38:56,972 --> 01:39:00,016
I can't do all this by myself.
Please? Look at you.

979
01:40:17,678 --> 01:40:18,720
Yeah.
