00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,481
Welcome to New Tokyo
International Airport. Welcome.

3
00:02:30,932 --> 00:02:32,762
- Welcome to Tokyo.
- Thank you very much.

4
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,267
My name is Kawasaki. Nice to meet you.
I've heard of you. Thank you.

5
00:02:36,404 --> 00:02:37,598
For you.
Thank you.

6
00:02:37,738 --> 00:02:39,603
- And Mr. Mori from Suntory.
- Hi.

7
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:42,265
And Miss Shibata.
Hey, I need that.

8
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:44,310
And Mr. Awinami.
Nice to meet you.

9
00:02:44,445 --> 00:02:45,776
All right.
Thank you.

10
00:02:45,913 --> 00:02:48,245
And Mr. Tanaka.
Thank you.
Thank you.

11
00:02:48,382 --> 00:02:50,680
And we will pick you up
in the morning?

12
00:02:50,818 --> 00:02:52,683
Okay.
See you tomorrow.

13
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,618
Great. Short and sweet.
Very Japanese. I like that.

14
00:02:55,756 --> 00:02:58,486
- My pleasure.
- Yeah, get some sleep, will ya?

15
00:02:58,626 --> 00:03:01,652
We're all... You're all really tired,
I'm sure. See you tomorrow.

16
00:03:01,796 --> 00:03:03,593
Good night. Thank you.

17
00:03:03,731 --> 00:03:05,596
Thank you...
What's this?

18
00:03:05,733 --> 00:03:07,894
Something good?

19
00:03:14,175 --> 00:03:16,109
Thank you.

20
00:03:25,786 --> 00:03:28,653
Mr. Harris, welcome to Park Hyatt Tokyo.
Yeah.

21
00:03:28,789 --> 00:03:30,723
This way, please.

22
00:03:32,059 --> 00:03:33,924
Mr. Harris,
pleased to welcome.

23
00:03:34,061 --> 00:03:35,926
Thank you.
Have a nice stay with us.

24
00:03:36,063 --> 00:03:37,997
This way.

25
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,965
Mr. Harris,
welcome to Park Hyatt Tokyo.

26
00:03:41,102 --> 00:03:42,967
Thank you.
Enjoy your stay with us.

27
00:03:43,104 --> 00:03:45,038
Thank you very much.

28
00:04:16,904 --> 00:04:21,967
I'm in your arms

29
00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:27,741
And you are kissing me

30
00:04:27,882 --> 00:04:31,477
But there seems to be

31
00:04:33,621 --> 00:04:37,148
Finish this drink, then
we'll go to a jazz club. Yeah.

32
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:39,555
You see that guy?
Yeah.

33
00:04:39,694 --> 00:04:42,060
You know who that is?
It's not him.

34
00:04:42,196 --> 00:04:44,562
It looks like him,
but it's not him.

35
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:47,566
Can you believe it?
Okay, maybe it is.

36
00:04:47,702 --> 00:04:50,569
He's here with us. I'm gonna go talk to him.
Shut up. Shut up.

37
00:04:50,705 --> 00:04:53,572
Bob? Bob Harris?
You're awesome, man!

38
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,573
Sunset Odds.
Loved it.

39
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:58,076
Man, that car chase...
I couldn't believe it.

40
00:04:58,212 --> 00:05:01,079
Four buses... And he took that thing
and everything exploded.

41
00:05:01,215 --> 00:05:05,015
I heard he did his own driving.
Did you do your own driving?

42
00:05:05,152 --> 00:05:07,017
I did.
Cool.

43
00:05:07,154 --> 00:05:10,021
So, what are you doing here?
Yeah.

44
00:05:10,157 --> 00:05:12,022
Um, seeing friends.
Seeing friends.

45
00:05:12,159 --> 00:05:14,024
Yeah? Great.

46
00:05:14,161 --> 00:05:16,026
We're here on business.

47
00:05:16,163 --> 00:05:18,028
I can see it in your eyes
Later.

48
00:05:18,165 --> 00:05:20,099
See you, Bob.
Keep it up.

49
00:06:22,163 --> 00:06:24,097
Are you awake?

50
00:06:27,835 --> 00:06:29,769
John.

51
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,205
Go to sleep.

52
00:07:17,151 --> 00:07:19,085
Aah.

53
00:07:37,571 --> 00:07:40,836
Moshi moshi.

54
00:07:40,975 --> 00:07:43,842
All ri...
Yeah, I'm coming down.

55
00:07:43,978 --> 00:07:45,843
Okay.

56
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:49,245
I gotta go to work.
Okay.

57
00:07:49,383 --> 00:07:52,250
I love you. I'll see you later.
Okay. Bye.

58
00:08:55,015 --> 00:08:57,210
Mr. Bob-san.

59
00:09:03,524 --> 00:09:06,789
Suntory whiskey.

60
00:09:18,005 --> 00:09:19,870
Casablanca. Bogie.

61
00:09:20,007 --> 00:09:22,942
Suntory time.

62
00:09:23,077 --> 00:09:26,740
Um, he want you to turn,
look in camera.

63
00:09:26,881 --> 00:09:29,406
Okay?

64
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,814
That's all he said?
Yes.

65
00:09:31,952 --> 00:09:33,886
Turn to camera.

66
00:09:36,357 --> 00:09:39,520
All right, does he want me
to... to... turn from the right,

67
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,958
or... turn from the left?

68
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,712
Passionate. Camera. Passion.

69
00:10:09,857 --> 00:10:12,883
Right side,
and, uh, with intensity.

70
00:10:13,027 --> 00:10:14,892
Okay?

71
00:10:15,029 --> 00:10:17,998
Is that everything? I mean, it seemed
like he said quite a bit more than that.

72
00:10:20,134 --> 00:10:21,999
Whiskey.

73
00:10:26,206 --> 00:10:28,265
Gently.

74
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:31,401
Tension.

75
00:10:31,545 --> 00:10:34,139
Like an old friend,
and into the camera.

76
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:37,281
Okay.

77
00:10:37,418 --> 00:10:39,682
Whiskey.

78
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,653
It's Suntory time! Okay?

79
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:46,157
- Okay.
- Okay?

80
00:10:48,495 --> 00:10:50,986
- Hey, come on!
Come on, come on, come on.

81
00:10:58,772 --> 00:11:01,536
For relaxing times,

82
00:11:01,675 --> 00:11:03,540
make it Suntory time.

83
00:11:04,645 --> 00:11:07,341
Cut-o!
Cut-o, cut-o, cut-o, cut-o, cut-o!

84
00:11:17,191 --> 00:11:19,352
Uh, could you do it slower...

85
00:11:19,493 --> 00:11:23,122
and with more... intensity?

86
00:11:27,334 --> 00:11:29,268
Suntory time.

87
00:11:45,452 --> 00:11:47,682
For relaxing times,

88
00:11:49,556 --> 00:11:51,717
make it Suntory time.

89
00:11:55,696 --> 00:11:58,164
Cut-o, cut-o, cut-o, cut-o!

90
00:13:14,074 --> 00:13:15,939
Hello?

91
00:13:16,076 --> 00:13:17,941
Lauren?

92
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:19,943
Charlotte! Hey!

93
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,945
Hey.
Oh, my God. How's Tokyo?

94
00:13:22,082 --> 00:13:24,516
It's great here.
It's really great.

95
00:13:24,651 --> 00:13:28,280
Um, I don't know...
I went to this shrine today.

96
00:13:28,422 --> 00:13:30,583
And, um,

97
00:13:30,724 --> 00:13:33,591
there were these monks
and they were chanting.

98
00:13:33,727 --> 00:13:37,663
And I didn't feel anything.
You know?

99
00:13:37,798 --> 00:13:40,289
And, um, I don't know...

100
00:13:40,434 --> 00:13:44,996
I even tried ikebana,
and John is using these hair products.

101
00:13:45,139 --> 00:13:48,631
I just... I don't know who I married.
Look, can you wait a second?

102
00:13:48,776 --> 00:13:51,210
Just hold on. I'll be right back.
Okay, sure.

103
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:54,144
Sorry.
What were you saying?

104
00:13:54,281 --> 00:13:56,647
Nothing. It's okay.
I'll call you later. Okay?

105
00:13:56,784 --> 00:13:59,651
Okay. Have the best time.
Just call me when you get back.

106
00:13:59,787 --> 00:14:01,721
Bye.
Love you. bBye.

107
00:15:09,289 --> 00:15:11,154
God!

108
00:15:16,096 --> 00:15:18,462
At the fitting today,
they had all these...

109
00:15:18,599 --> 00:15:20,464
rock and roll clothes,

110
00:15:20,601 --> 00:15:22,967
but the band
wasn't tough at all.

111
00:15:23,103 --> 00:15:25,970
The label guy just kept saying,
"More lock and loll,"

112
00:15:26,106 --> 00:15:29,473
but it's just so much better if they're just
skinny and nerdy like they came in, you know.

113
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:33,068
They're making them wear all these
Keith Richards clothes, and it's just ridiculous.

114
00:15:33,213 --> 00:15:36,080
They should let them be who they are.
Don't you think?

115
00:15:36,216 --> 00:15:38,047
Yeah.

116
00:15:38,185 --> 00:15:40,085
Yeah, that's exactly
what I was saying.

117
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,711
But then you try to...
I mean, you know...

118
00:15:42,856 --> 00:15:44,721
That's what I think.

119
00:15:44,858 --> 00:15:46,792
Do you think this is done?

120
00:15:49,096 --> 00:15:51,963
I don't know. I don't know.

121
00:15:54,268 --> 00:15:57,829
Would you... Would you
please stop smoking?

122
00:15:57,971 --> 00:16:00,269
I like to.
I don't really smoke that much.

123
00:16:00,407 --> 00:16:02,637
It's just so bad for you,
though.

124
00:16:02,776 --> 00:16:04,710
Well, I'll stop later.

125
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:20,158
Welcome back, Mr. Harris.
Yes, Mr. Harris.

126
00:16:20,294 --> 00:16:22,626
Please. Thank you.

127
00:17:03,804 --> 00:17:05,328
Mr. Harris?
Yes?

128
00:17:05,472 --> 00:17:07,337
Mr. Kazu sent me.
Oh?

129
00:17:07,474 --> 00:17:09,408
May I enter?

130
00:17:10,811 --> 00:17:12,745
Thank you.

131
00:17:12,879 --> 00:17:15,074
Do you like massage?

132
00:17:15,215 --> 00:17:19,015
I don't think
I... I like massage anymore.

133
00:17:19,152 --> 00:17:22,952
Mr. Kazu sends
premium fantasy.

134
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:26,719
My stockings... "lip" them.

135
00:17:28,261 --> 00:17:32,197
"Lip" my stockings.

136
00:17:33,433 --> 00:17:35,298
Yes, please.

137
00:17:35,435 --> 00:17:37,426
"Lip" them.

138
00:17:37,571 --> 00:17:39,436
What?

139
00:17:39,573 --> 00:17:41,507
"Lip" them.

140
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:45,075
Hey! "Lip" my stocking!

141
00:17:45,212 --> 00:17:48,238
Hey! "Lip" them?
"Lip" them? What?

142
00:17:48,382 --> 00:17:51,044
"Lip" them. Like this.
"Lip" them.

143
00:17:51,184 --> 00:17:53,049
Rip them?
"Lip," yes.

144
00:17:53,186 --> 00:17:56,053
You want me
to rip your stockings?
Yes, "lip" my stockings, please.

145
00:17:56,189 --> 00:17:59,556
Rip your stockings. You want me to rip
your stockings. Yes. Please? Please? Please?

146
00:17:59,693 --> 00:18:03,595
All right, I'm gonna rip your stockings,
and you tell Mr. Kazu we had a blast.

147
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:06,221
Oh, no! Mr. Harris!
Oh, my God!

148
00:18:06,366 --> 00:18:08,231
Don't touch me!

149
00:18:08,368 --> 00:18:11,565
Mr. Bob Harris,
don't touch me!

150
00:18:11,705 --> 00:18:13,570
Just "lip" my stocking!

151
00:18:13,707 --> 00:18:16,437
Oh, no, Mr. Harris!

152
00:18:16,576 --> 00:18:20,137
Oh, no! Help! Help!
Yeah... Yeah.

153
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,145
Help, please! Help, please!
Okay.

154
00:18:22,282 --> 00:18:24,648
Mr. Harris, help, please.
Careful with those.

155
00:18:24,785 --> 00:18:27,447
Oh! Help, please! Help, please!
Come on. Come on.

156
00:18:27,587 --> 00:18:30,249
Let me go, Mr. Harris!

157
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:32,585
Oh, no! Let me go!
Come on. Come on.

158
00:18:32,726 --> 00:18:36,321
Ohh! Let me go! Let me go.
Oh, crap.

159
00:18:36,463 --> 00:18:38,055
Please let me go.
With pleasure.

160
00:18:38,198 --> 00:18:41,998
Oh, no, Mr. Bob Harris,
don't let me go! No!

161
00:18:42,135 --> 00:18:46,003
No! Oh, no,
Mr. Bob Harris!

162
00:18:46,139 --> 00:18:48,539
Ohh! Oh, please.

163
00:18:48,675 --> 00:18:50,609
Let me go, please!

164
00:19:36,256 --> 00:19:39,384
Mr. Harris! Good morning.

165
00:19:39,526 --> 00:19:41,016
Hi.

166
00:19:41,161 --> 00:19:45,029
We just got a request from Tanabe Mori.
He is the Johnny Carson of Japan.

167
00:19:45,165 --> 00:19:48,862
It is a big honor
to be invited to his show.

168
00:19:49,002 --> 00:19:50,731
Can you stay here
until Friday?

169
00:19:50,871 --> 00:19:54,637
Uh, I'm surprised and honored, but I think
I need to check with my agent.

170
00:19:54,774 --> 00:19:57,641
Okay, I believe I may have
a previous commitment.

171
00:19:57,777 --> 00:19:59,642
Sure.
I understand.

172
00:19:59,779 --> 00:20:01,713
Shall we go?
Yes.

173
00:20:23,336 --> 00:20:26,430
I think you should do it.
No, hear this, Fred.

174
00:20:26,573 --> 00:20:29,269
I gotta be on a plane
Thursday night.

175
00:20:29,409 --> 00:20:31,274
We're looking into it, Bob.

176
00:20:31,411 --> 00:20:34,278
They really want you to stay
and do that talk show.

177
00:20:34,414 --> 00:20:36,279
Apparently,
he's a really big deal...

178
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:39,078
Johnny Carson of Japan.
Yeah.

179
00:20:39,219 --> 00:20:42,586
Bob, these people
are paying you a lot.
Would you please consider it?

180
00:20:42,722 --> 00:20:45,589
I already have.
I-I gotta get out of here.

181
00:20:45,725 --> 00:20:47,590
As soon as I can.

182
00:20:47,727 --> 00:20:51,595
All right, you're scheduled to leave Friday,
but we'll hold it for you Saturday.

183
00:20:51,731 --> 00:20:55,258
You're breaking up, Fred.
There's no reception in this studio.

184
00:20:55,402 --> 00:20:57,336
Forget it.
Call me back.

185
00:21:05,178 --> 00:21:08,409
So, can you put your hand
close your face, please?

186
00:21:08,548 --> 00:21:10,140
I'm sorry, Naka. What?

187
00:21:10,283 --> 00:21:14,879
Can you put your hand
close your face?

188
00:21:18,258 --> 00:21:20,658
I don't get that close to the glass
until I'm on the floor.

189
00:21:20,794 --> 00:21:22,659
How's this?

190
00:21:22,796 --> 00:21:25,162
Yes.
You want a whiskey?

191
00:21:27,901 --> 00:21:31,393
This is not whiskey. This is iced tea.
If you gave me real whiskey...

192
00:21:31,538 --> 00:21:33,403
I need mysterious face.

193
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,770
Can you show mysterious?
Mysterious.

194
00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:38,605
I think I know what you want.
You want this, right?

195
00:21:38,745 --> 00:21:40,940
I need more mysterious and, uh...

196
00:21:41,081 --> 00:21:45,518
More mysterious. Yeah. I'll just try to think,
"Where the hell's the whiskey?"

197
00:21:48,455 --> 00:21:51,185
You are a movie star, yes?

198
00:21:51,324 --> 00:21:55,192
Yes, I should be doing movies, yes, but...
And "Lat Pack. "

199
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:57,853
"Lat Pack. "
You know "Lat Pack"?

200
00:21:57,998 --> 00:21:59,863
Rat P... Rat Pack?

201
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,264
Rat Pack. Yes, please.
Oh, right, right.

202
00:22:07,607 --> 00:22:10,474
I need more tension, please.

203
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:12,544
More t...

204
00:22:15,682 --> 00:22:18,048
You so gentleman, yes?

205
00:22:18,184 --> 00:22:20,118
A-ring-a-ding-ding.
Yeah.

206
00:22:21,121 --> 00:22:23,453
"Sinatora. "
You know "Sinatora"?

207
00:22:25,025 --> 00:22:26,890
Old Blue Eyes.
Yeah.

208
00:22:27,027 --> 00:22:28,858
That's good.
Yeah.

209
00:22:28,995 --> 00:22:32,522
That's more of Dino. That's Dino.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

210
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:34,531
Great.

211
00:22:34,668 --> 00:22:37,228
Joey Bishop would you like?
Yes. Just change film.

212
00:22:42,876 --> 00:22:44,639
Are you drinking?
No?

213
00:22:44,778 --> 00:22:46,643
Am I drinking?
As soon as I'm done.

214
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,975
Okay, close your hand,
please.

215
00:22:49,115 --> 00:22:50,980
Close your hand.
Yeah... Close it?

216
00:22:51,117 --> 00:22:52,982
Yes.
Close your face, please.

217
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:55,246
Close my...
Yes. Sorry.

218
00:22:55,388 --> 00:22:58,380
And, uh, 007?

219
00:22:58,525 --> 00:23:01,688
He drinks martinis, but okay, I got it.
007, yeah.

220
00:23:01,828 --> 00:23:03,295
"Loger" Moore?

221
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:05,159
"Loger"Moore?
"Loger" Moore.

222
00:23:05,298 --> 00:23:07,630
You know "Loger" Moore?
Roger Moore?

223
00:23:07,767 --> 00:23:10,167
Yeah.
Okay. I... I...

224
00:23:10,303 --> 00:23:12,567
- I always think of Sean Connery. Seriously.
- No, no.

225
00:23:12,706 --> 00:23:16,164
Didn't you get the Sean Connery one over here?
No. "Loger" Moore.

226
00:23:16,309 --> 00:23:18,174
Yes.

227
00:23:18,311 --> 00:23:20,302
"Loger" Moore?
No...

228
00:23:20,447 --> 00:23:22,711
Yeah. Okay.

229
00:23:22,849 --> 00:23:25,443
Yeah, okay. Good.

230
00:23:25,585 --> 00:23:27,553
More. Please.

231
00:23:27,687 --> 00:23:30,383
You mean "more," or "Roger Moore"again?
Yeah. Yeah.

232
00:23:30,523 --> 00:23:33,390
Good.

233
00:23:33,526 --> 00:23:35,460
And sexy!

234
00:23:41,468 --> 00:23:44,960
Are you going

235
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:49,475
To Scarborough Fair

236
00:23:53,747 --> 00:23:56,910
Parsley, sage

237
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:59,883
Rosemary

238
00:24:00,019 --> 00:24:03,318
And thyme

239
00:24:03,456 --> 00:24:05,447
He's really sad.

240
00:24:10,296 --> 00:24:12,764
Thank you.
We're glad to be here.

241
00:24:12,899 --> 00:24:14,833
We're Sausalito.

242
00:24:28,381 --> 00:24:32,181
They're beautiful. They're beautiful, yeah.
You know?

243
00:24:32,318 --> 00:24:35,776
Send these over
to that table over there.

244
00:24:35,922 --> 00:24:37,787
Old temple?
An old temple?

245
00:24:37,924 --> 00:24:39,789
Yeah.
Oh, beautiful, man.

246
00:24:39,926 --> 00:24:43,293
Excuse me, sir.
From the woman over there.

247
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:45,660
Oh! Oh, th-they are?
Really?

248
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:47,664
Yeah, yeah.
Wh-What's... What's...

249
00:24:47,801 --> 00:24:50,133
Is Japan...
Is it mainly Buddhism here?

250
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:53,364
Yeah, it's Buddhism.

251
00:24:53,506 --> 00:24:55,371
CD or...

252
00:24:55,508 --> 00:24:57,373
Yeah, CD.
Playing her...

253
00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:00,536
Oh, she plays... guitar?
Guitar. Guitar.

254
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,012
That's a beautiful job.

255
00:25:36,316 --> 00:25:38,181
Help!

256
00:26:01,641 --> 00:26:03,438
Good morning.
Good morning.

257
00:26:03,576 --> 00:26:05,441
Good morning.
Good morning.

258
00:26:05,578 --> 00:26:07,512
Are you okay?
Yeah. Fine.

259
00:26:08,815 --> 00:26:10,908
Car is outside.
Shall we go?

260
00:26:14,888 --> 00:26:16,753
That's what I told him.

261
00:26:18,892 --> 00:26:21,258
He never listens.
Yeah.

262
00:26:23,563 --> 00:26:25,121
John?

263
00:26:25,265 --> 00:26:28,530
Oh, my God! John!
What are you doing here?

264
00:26:28,668 --> 00:26:32,695
Uh, oh, w-well, you know, uh, w...
I'm just here, uh, shooting a band.

265
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:35,364
What about you?
I'm here promoting that action movie I did.

266
00:26:35,508 --> 00:26:39,137
Hyah! You know!
I'm doing 20 million interviews a day.

267
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,144
It's crazy.

268
00:26:41,281 --> 00:26:43,476
God, it is so good to see you!
Yeah. Yeah.

269
00:26:43,616 --> 00:26:47,052
So, how long are you gonna be here?
We're here for a week.

270
00:26:47,186 --> 00:26:49,051
I'm gonna go shoot
in Fukawaka.

271
00:26:49,188 --> 00:26:51,053
Oh, it's amazing!

272
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:53,090
Yeah. Oh. Oh, yeah.
It's amazing.

273
00:26:56,429 --> 00:26:59,421
You know... Oh, this is...
this is my wife, Charlotte.

274
00:26:59,566 --> 00:27:02,364
Hi! It's really nice to meet you!
Hi. Nice to meet you.

275
00:27:02,502 --> 00:27:04,561
Hello!
Yeah!

276
00:27:04,704 --> 00:27:06,797
Wife?
Yeah. Yeah.

277
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:09,135
John. John.

278
00:27:09,275 --> 00:27:11,140
You are
my favorite photographer.

279
00:27:11,277 --> 00:27:14,246
Oh, come on!
No, you are. I only want you to shoot me.

280
00:27:16,382 --> 00:27:18,247
It's true!

281
00:27:18,384 --> 00:27:20,852
I have the worst B.O. Right now.
I'm so sorry.

282
00:27:20,987 --> 00:27:23,581
No, no, no.
But, listen, um...

283
00:27:23,723 --> 00:27:26,453
- Let's all go out for a drink sometime.
- Yeah.

284
00:27:26,593 --> 00:27:29,460
You know? Call me. Okay?
Yeah. Okay.

285
00:27:29,596 --> 00:27:31,461
Listen,
I'm under Evelyn Waugh.

286
00:27:31,598 --> 00:27:33,463
Shh. Okay?

287
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,124
Okay. Yeah.

288
00:27:35,268 --> 00:27:37,099
Okay, arigato, arigato.

289
00:27:37,236 --> 00:27:39,704
Moshi moshi!

290
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:41,704
Evelyn Waugh?

291
00:27:41,841 --> 00:27:44,036
What?
Evelyn Waugh was a man.

292
00:27:44,177 --> 00:27:46,111
Oh, come on.
She's nice.

293
00:27:47,347 --> 00:27:50,612
What? You know...
You know, not everybody went to Yale.

294
00:27:51,751 --> 00:27:54,276
It was just a pseudonym,
for Christ's sake.

295
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,285
Why do you
have to defend her?

296
00:27:56,422 --> 00:27:59,789
Well, why do you have to point out
how stupid everybody is all the time?

297
00:27:59,926 --> 00:28:02,053
I thought it was funny.
Forget it.

298
00:28:02,195 --> 00:28:04,060
Well...

299
00:28:04,197 --> 00:28:07,564
Hey, John, we gotta go.
Oh. Yeah.

300
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,634
Bye.

301
00:28:11,971 --> 00:28:15,202
Did you ever wonder
what your purpose in life is?

302
00:28:15,341 --> 00:28:18,868
This book is about finding
your soul's purpose or destiny.

303
00:28:19,012 --> 00:28:22,743
Every soul has its path,
but sometimes that path is not clear.

304
00:28:22,882 --> 00:28:27,546
The Inner Map Theory is an example
of how each soul begins with an imprint,

305
00:28:27,687 --> 00:28:31,088
all compacted into a pattern
that has been selected by your soul...

306
00:28:31,224 --> 00:28:33,522
before you've even gotten here.

307
00:28:37,664 --> 00:28:41,691
You know, I guess the reason
why I like Japan the best...

308
00:28:41,834 --> 00:28:43,699
out of all Asian countries...

309
00:28:43,836 --> 00:28:48,500
is because I really feel
close to, um, Buddhism.

310
00:28:48,641 --> 00:28:50,836
I really feel...
I really believe in reincarnation.

311
00:28:50,977 --> 00:28:53,844
That's part of what drew me
to Midnight Velocity as well,

312
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:57,472
because although Keanu dies,

313
00:28:57,617 --> 00:28:59,482
he eventually
gets reincarnated.

314
00:28:59,619 --> 00:29:03,180
So there's hope...
There's hope in reincarnation, I think.

315
00:29:03,322 --> 00:29:06,189
What was it like working
with Keanu Reeves?

316
00:29:06,325 --> 00:29:09,726
He was always so...
He was always, you know, giving me ideas...

317
00:29:09,862 --> 00:29:11,727
and, you know, really helpful.

318
00:29:11,864 --> 00:29:13,729
He made me feel
really comfortable, so...

319
00:29:13,866 --> 00:29:17,529
And we both have two dogs,
and we both live in L.A.,

320
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:20,798
so we have all these
different things in common.

321
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,807
So, you know, we both
really like Mexican food...

322
00:29:23,943 --> 00:29:26,104
and yoga and...

323
00:29:26,245 --> 00:29:28,110
karate!

324
00:29:28,247 --> 00:29:32,149
Mexican food. Yoga.

325
00:29:49,502 --> 00:29:52,198
Konnichi wa.
Hello. Hi.

326
00:29:55,641 --> 00:29:58,166
okay.

327
00:30:05,918 --> 00:30:07,852
Okay.

328
00:30:11,257 --> 00:30:13,191
Okay.

329
00:30:18,965 --> 00:30:22,992
Hai. Okay. Hai. Hai.
Okay.

330
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:37,737
He got married
a couple of times...

331
00:31:37,877 --> 00:31:39,742
To some nice women.

332
00:31:39,879 --> 00:31:43,246
Beautiful women too. I mean, you and I
would be crazy for these women.

333
00:31:43,382 --> 00:31:45,748
But there were
always rumors.

334
00:31:45,885 --> 00:31:47,750
I never liked his acting,

335
00:31:47,887 --> 00:31:50,754
so I never gave a damn
whether he was straight or not.

336
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:53,757
Thank you... Hi.
Thanks.

337
00:31:53,893 --> 00:31:55,758
What can I get you?

338
00:31:55,895 --> 00:31:58,455
Um, I'm not sure.

339
00:32:00,967 --> 00:32:03,527
For relaxing times,
make it...

340
00:32:03,669 --> 00:32:05,603
Suntory time.

341
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:10,036
Um, I'll have a vodka tonic.

342
00:32:10,176 --> 00:32:12,110
Thanks.

343
00:32:17,516 --> 00:32:19,450
So, what are you
doing here?

344
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,986
Uh, a couple of things.

345
00:32:23,122 --> 00:32:26,751
Taking a break from my wife,
forgetting my son's birthday,

346
00:32:26,893 --> 00:32:29,157
and, uh, getting paid
$2 million...

347
00:32:29,295 --> 00:32:31,786
to endorse a whiskey...

348
00:32:31,931 --> 00:32:34,866
when I could be doing
a play somewhere.

349
00:32:36,135 --> 00:32:38,365
Oh.

350
00:32:38,504 --> 00:32:40,870
But the good news is,
the whiskey works.

351
00:32:48,381 --> 00:32:50,747
What are you doing?

352
00:32:50,883 --> 00:32:53,408
Um, my husband's
a photographer,

353
00:32:53,552 --> 00:32:56,419
so he's here working and, uh,

354
00:32:56,555 --> 00:32:58,921
I wasn't doing anything,
so I came along.

355
00:32:59,058 --> 00:33:02,926
And we have some friends that live here.
How long have you been married?

356
00:33:03,062 --> 00:33:04,927
Oh, thank you.

357
00:33:05,064 --> 00:33:07,862
Two years.

358
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,865
Twenty-five long ones.

359
00:33:12,405 --> 00:33:15,272
You're probably just
having a midlife crisis.

360
00:33:15,408 --> 00:33:17,342
Did you buy a Porsche yet?

361
00:33:18,744 --> 00:33:21,474
You know, I was thinking
about buying a Porsche.

362
00:33:25,351 --> 00:33:27,216
Twenty-five years.

363
00:33:27,353 --> 00:33:30,220
That's a...
Well, it's impressive.

364
00:33:33,626 --> 00:33:37,153
Well, you figure you sleep
one-third of your life.

365
00:33:37,296 --> 00:33:39,958
That knocks off eight years
of marriage right there.

366
00:33:40,099 --> 00:33:41,964
So you're down
to 16 and change.

367
00:33:42,101 --> 00:33:43,966
You're just a teenager
at marriage.

368
00:33:44,103 --> 00:33:47,402
You can drive it, but there's
still the occasional accident.

369
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:50,065
Yeah.

370
00:33:50,209 --> 00:33:52,143
What do you do?

371
00:33:56,382 --> 00:33:58,247
I'm not sure yet,
actually.

372
00:33:58,384 --> 00:34:01,080
I just graduated
last spring.

373
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,017
What did you study?

374
00:34:03,155 --> 00:34:05,020
Philosophy.

375
00:34:05,157 --> 00:34:08,593
Yeah, there's a good buck in that racket.
Yeah.

376
00:34:09,695 --> 00:34:12,220
Well, so far
it's pro bono.

377
00:34:14,367 --> 00:34:17,461
Well, I'm sure you'll figure out the angles.
Yeah.

378
00:34:19,872 --> 00:34:22,966
I hope your Porsche works out.

379
00:34:23,109 --> 00:34:25,873
Cheers to that, huh?
Cheers to that.

380
00:34:26,012 --> 00:34:27,946
Kanpai.

381
00:34:37,523 --> 00:34:39,457
Wish I could sleep.

382
00:34:39,592 --> 00:34:41,526
Me too.

383
00:34:48,901 --> 00:34:52,496
One, two, three,
and okay.

384
00:34:53,572 --> 00:34:55,506
All right.

385
00:35:03,249 --> 00:35:06,514
One, two, three, four.

386
00:35:06,652 --> 00:35:10,144
And one, two, three, four.

387
00:35:10,289 --> 00:35:12,154
And one, two...

388
00:36:26,165 --> 00:36:28,690
Wait! Take me with you!

389
00:36:46,485 --> 00:36:48,851
How'd it go, huh?

390
00:36:48,988 --> 00:36:52,185
Oh, it was good, you know.
I'm tired.

391
00:36:52,324 --> 00:36:55,191
Yeah, I-I-I gotta go downstairs
and meet Kelly for some drinks.

392
00:36:55,327 --> 00:36:59,696
She wants to talk about some photo thing.
Maybe I'll go downstairs with you.

393
00:36:59,832 --> 00:37:01,697
Oh, you wanna come?

394
00:37:01,834 --> 00:37:03,631
Yeah, sure.

395
00:37:03,769 --> 00:37:05,862
Okay. Yeah.

396
00:37:07,973 --> 00:37:10,134
You

397
00:37:10,276 --> 00:37:14,235
Stepped out
of a dream

398
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:17,907
Everybody is always, like,
"Kelly, you are anorexic. "

399
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:21,918
And I'm, like, "No, I'm not. "I eat
so much junk food, you wouldn't believe it.

400
00:37:22,054 --> 00:37:23,919
Just because I have
a high metabolism.

401
00:37:24,056 --> 00:37:25,921
Because I thought
you were anorexic too.

402
00:37:26,058 --> 00:37:29,619
Everybody does. Everybody thinks that.
Yeah, 'cause you look so...

403
00:37:29,762 --> 00:37:31,627
Thank you!
I know, but it's...

404
00:37:31,764 --> 00:37:34,062
I mean, I eat whatever.
I have a really high metabolism.

405
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,101
Yeah.
But, um...

406
00:37:38,871 --> 00:37:42,068
My dad
was an anorexic.

407
00:37:42,208 --> 00:37:44,699
Really?
Oh, really?

408
00:37:44,843 --> 00:37:46,708
Yeah.

409
00:37:46,845 --> 00:37:50,713
He, um, fought on the American side
of the Bay of Pigs in Cuba.

410
00:37:50,849 --> 00:37:55,047
He was taken prisoner, and the whole time
he was there they tortured him about food.

411
00:37:55,187 --> 00:37:59,283
Every day they told him
they put poison in the food.

412
00:37:59,425 --> 00:38:02,087
So they would always make themselves
throw up after every meal.

413
00:38:02,228 --> 00:38:05,095
That's horrible.
That's terrible.

414
00:38:05,231 --> 00:38:07,222
That's some crazy shit.

415
00:38:07,366 --> 00:38:09,334
You don't think he sounds kinda goofy?
No!

416
00:38:09,468 --> 00:38:13,097
You know that break beat, right?
Well, I been takin' it to some next level shit.

417
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:16,106
Like, I'll take that and put
a delay on it, so it's like...

418
00:38:18,744 --> 00:38:21,235
So it's, like, evolving,
the beat.

419
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:25,180
So it, like, sounds hella large
on the track. You know what I'm sayin'?

420
00:38:25,317 --> 00:38:27,182
No.
No?

421
00:38:27,319 --> 00:38:29,150
You don't listen to hip-hop?

422
00:38:29,288 --> 00:38:31,654
Oh, my God!
You guys gotta listen.

423
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:34,623
I tried this power cleanse.
It's so amazing.

424
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,524
Okay, promise me you'll try it.
Will you try this power cleanse?

425
00:38:37,663 --> 00:38:40,029
I did it last week, and it's amazing.
I'll be right back.

426
00:38:40,165 --> 00:38:42,463
It's so good to get
the toxins out of your body.

427
00:38:42,601 --> 00:38:45,934
With all, like, the pollution,
all, like, the...

428
00:38:50,542 --> 00:38:52,407
Hello.
Hello.

429
00:38:52,544 --> 00:38:55,536
You ever switch seats?

430
00:38:55,681 --> 00:38:58,946
Uh, I like this one.
If I fall, someone will notice.

431
00:38:59,084 --> 00:39:02,019
Yeah.

432
00:39:02,154 --> 00:39:04,281
So, you having a nice time?

433
00:39:04,423 --> 00:39:06,288
Can you keep a secret?

434
00:39:06,425 --> 00:39:09,019
I'm trying to organize
a prison break.

435
00:39:09,161 --> 00:39:12,062
I'm looking for, like,
an accomplice.

436
00:39:12,197 --> 00:39:15,530
We'd have to, first,
get out of this bar.

437
00:39:15,668 --> 00:39:19,536
Then the hotel, then the city,
and then the country.

438
00:39:19,672 --> 00:39:22,539
Are you in, or are you out?
I'm in.

439
00:39:22,675 --> 00:39:24,540
Good.
I'll go pack my stuff.

440
00:39:24,677 --> 00:39:27,407
Get your coat.
See ya.

441
00:39:27,546 --> 00:39:30,743
I hope you've had enough to drink.
It's gonna take courage.

442
00:39:36,889 --> 00:39:40,882
Oh, look.
The label got me these.

443
00:39:41,026 --> 00:39:44,086
Mmm, I love Cristal.
You wanna have some?

444
00:39:44,229 --> 00:39:49,064
Well, I'm...
I gotta go. I mean, I...

445
00:39:50,536 --> 00:39:53,403
Y-You know,
you don't have to stay.

446
00:39:53,539 --> 00:39:56,167
I mean...
You don't have to go, do you?

447
00:39:56,308 --> 00:39:58,173
Well, I...

448
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:00,676
I know. You're gonna be
working the whole time.

449
00:40:00,813 --> 00:40:05,147
I'll have a much better time here. I'll call
Charlie and those guys. - Yeah! Call those guys.

450
00:40:05,284 --> 00:40:08,651
And I'm gonna be back
on Sunday, and I...

451
00:40:08,787 --> 00:40:10,721
I love you, you know.

452
00:40:14,493 --> 00:40:16,586
Okay?
I love you.

453
00:40:20,366 --> 00:40:22,891
I'll see you. Okay? Yeah, it's just gonna be
a couple of... a couple of days.

454
00:40:23,035 --> 00:40:24,900
Bye.

455
00:40:25,037 --> 00:40:26,971
I love you.

456
00:41:31,303 --> 00:41:32,827
Hello.

457
00:41:32,971 --> 00:41:34,461
Hello.
How are you?

458
00:41:34,606 --> 00:41:36,801
Good. How are you?

459
00:41:41,113 --> 00:41:44,378
It's a cool pool, isn't it?
Yeah, it's nice.

460
00:41:45,651 --> 00:41:47,516
Get any sleep?

461
00:41:47,653 --> 00:41:50,213
Not yet.
How about you?

462
00:41:50,355 --> 00:41:52,220
No. Not yet.

463
00:41:52,357 --> 00:41:54,825
How long you staying for?

464
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:59,056
I'll be in the bar
for the rest of the week.

465
00:41:59,198 --> 00:42:02,065
Well, that's good.

466
00:42:02,201 --> 00:42:06,001
Um, I'm going out with some friends later,
if you wanna come.

467
00:42:07,239 --> 00:42:10,766
Sure.
Okay. I'll see you later.

468
00:42:10,909 --> 00:42:12,843
Okay.
See ya.

469
00:42:16,515 --> 00:42:18,449
Oop...

470
00:42:26,325 --> 00:42:28,953
"Bob, which one do you want
for your study?

471
00:42:29,094 --> 00:42:31,028
I like the burgundy,
but whatever you want. "

472
00:42:43,141 --> 00:42:45,006
Which one is burgundy?

473
00:42:47,479 --> 00:42:49,344
Hold on!

474
00:42:49,481 --> 00:42:51,415
Hold on.

475
00:42:52,651 --> 00:42:57,384
You really are
having a midlife crisis, huh?

476
00:42:57,523 --> 00:43:00,390
Really?
Yeah, I was afraid of that.

477
00:43:00,526 --> 00:43:05,327
I kept telling myself that I just wanted
to be ready in case we go to war tonight.

478
00:43:08,967 --> 00:43:11,401
My bathroom
is messier than yours.

479
00:43:16,341 --> 00:43:18,206
And it's not like
you're not tryin'.

480
00:43:18,343 --> 00:43:21,278
Here, will you cut the tag out for me?
Sure.

481
00:43:23,549 --> 00:43:26,347
You're too tall.

482
00:43:26,485 --> 00:43:30,945
Uh, anybody ever tell you
you may be too small?

483
00:43:31,089 --> 00:43:34,991
Whose is this? "A Soul's Search:
Finding Your True Calling. "

484
00:43:35,127 --> 00:43:37,618
I don't know.

485
00:43:37,763 --> 00:43:41,255
I have that.
Did it work out
for you, then?

486
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,834
Obviously.

487
00:43:45,571 --> 00:43:47,937
Okay.
Okay.

488
00:43:50,075 --> 00:43:52,168
Where's your shoes?
They're over here.

489
00:43:52,311 --> 00:43:54,643
- Where's your room key?
- It's in my bag.

490
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:57,647
- And where's your bag?
- It's right here.

491
00:43:57,783 --> 00:43:59,648
Let's go.
Wait!

492
00:43:59,785 --> 00:44:01,946
There's the elevator.
I gotta go.

493
00:44:05,324 --> 00:44:07,189
Hi! How are you?
Hi, Charlie!

494
00:44:10,329 --> 00:44:12,297
Um, Bob,
this is Charlie Brown.

495
00:44:12,431 --> 00:44:15,594
Hi. Nice to meet you.
How are you? Nice to meet you.

496
00:44:15,734 --> 00:44:17,326
- This is Bambi.
- How are you, Bambi?

497
00:44:17,469 --> 00:44:20,802
His real name's Hayashi, but...
Why do they call you Charlie Brown?

498
00:44:20,939 --> 00:44:24,431
Everybody say, "He looks like Charlie Brown."
You know, Snoopy, man.

499
00:44:24,576 --> 00:44:26,806
Oh, I'll be right back.

500
00:44:26,945 --> 00:44:31,279
Bob, over here. These are my friends.
Very beautiful.

501
00:44:31,416 --> 00:44:35,284
She's "B," and she's Rico,
and she's Myumi.

502
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:37,684
- Myumi. How are you? I'm Bob.
- Oh! Bob.

503
00:44:37,823 --> 00:44:39,723
Bob from
United States, man.

504
00:44:39,858 --> 00:44:42,691
Ahh!
Hi, Bob.

505
00:44:42,828 --> 00:44:45,194
Maybe you'd like to
sing backup for me.

506
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:47,525
This is my surfing teacher.
- He's your surfing teacher?

507
00:44:47,666 --> 00:44:49,793
Sometime, sometime.
You're a surfer?

508
00:45:26,004 --> 00:45:28,404
Oh, oui, oui.
The emperor's house? Cool.

509
00:45:31,943 --> 00:45:34,776
Yeah?
Yeah.

510
00:45:34,913 --> 00:45:36,778
Oui.

511
00:45:36,915 --> 00:45:40,248
Cool!
Right.

512
00:45:40,385 --> 00:45:42,751
You don't have anything...
Do you have anything b...

513
00:45:42,888 --> 00:45:44,549
Hey.
Hey. How you doin'?

514
00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:47,022
- Good. How are you?
- My Japanese is getting better.

515
00:45:47,159 --> 00:45:49,024
We started speaking English.

516
00:45:54,332 --> 00:45:56,197
Charlie.

517
00:46:01,773 --> 00:46:04,071
Ooh! Get out, guys!

518
00:46:04,209 --> 00:46:07,576
- I'm leaving!
They'll sting!

519
00:46:09,081 --> 00:46:10,981
Whoo!

520
00:46:14,786 --> 00:46:19,223
Who are these guys, anyway?

521
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:24,824
Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey!

522
00:46:26,064 --> 00:46:27,929
Oh, no.

523
00:46:50,155 --> 00:46:52,020
Hi.

524
00:46:52,157 --> 00:46:54,182
Come on!

525
00:46:54,326 --> 00:46:56,191
Hey, guys! Over here!

526
00:46:56,328 --> 00:46:58,193
Hurry up! Hurry up!
Hurry up!

527
00:46:58,330 --> 00:46:59,763
Wait!
Our tour guide!

528
00:46:59,898 --> 00:47:01,832
Hurry up!

529
00:47:10,242 --> 00:47:11,869
Yeah?
Gorgeous.

530
00:47:12,010 --> 00:47:13,773
Gorgeous?
Blonde and black.

531
00:47:16,982 --> 00:47:19,678
Well, it's a feelin'I get

532
00:47:19,818 --> 00:47:22,685
- Cheese. Cheese-o!
- Cheese!

533
00:47:25,423 --> 00:47:27,288
Yeah, yeah... Hi.
It's a feelin'I get

534
00:47:27,425 --> 00:47:29,859
Hi, I'm Hans.
Nice to meet you.

535
00:47:29,995 --> 00:47:31,394
I'm Charlotte.
Nice to meet you.

536
00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:33,395
Hi.
Hi.

537
00:47:37,836 --> 00:47:41,135
Last weekend, I went surfing.
Right.

538
00:47:41,273 --> 00:47:44,765
About seven people, you know.
Some friends.

539
00:47:44,910 --> 00:47:48,971
And we camp over there
on the beach.

540
00:47:49,114 --> 00:47:53,244
In fact, we made a kind of...

541
00:47:53,385 --> 00:47:56,081
Wait. What kind of weed is it?
I don't know.

542
00:47:56,221 --> 00:48:00,749
Baby, when I saw you turnin'
at the end of the street

543
00:48:03,028 --> 00:48:05,189
I knew our time was gone

544
00:48:05,330 --> 00:48:08,163
Into blank pages

545
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:13,397
Just understand I was afraid
to be a simple guy

546
00:48:13,538 --> 00:48:15,972
I tried my best to smile

547
00:48:16,107 --> 00:48:18,837
But deep inside my heart

548
00:48:18,977 --> 00:48:22,208
I felt like the shell
that a crab comes in

549
00:48:22,347 --> 00:48:25,043
I guess I couldn't
live without things

550
00:48:28,153 --> 00:48:31,054
A fascist regime

551
00:48:31,189 --> 00:48:34,022
It made you a moron

552
00:48:34,159 --> 00:48:36,354
A potential H-bomb

553
00:48:37,829 --> 00:48:39,262
God save the queen

554
00:48:40,699 --> 00:48:42,496
She ain't no human being

555
00:48:43,768 --> 00:48:46,931
There's no future

556
00:48:47,072 --> 00:48:50,633
In England's dreaming

557
00:48:53,245 --> 00:48:56,442
As I walk through

558
00:48:56,581 --> 00:48:59,243
This wicked world

559
00:49:00,418 --> 00:49:03,785
Searchin' for light
in the darkness

560
00:49:03,922 --> 00:49:06,914
Of insanity

561
00:49:07,058 --> 00:49:09,049
I ask myself

562
00:49:10,195 --> 00:49:13,596
Is all hope lost

563
00:49:13,732 --> 00:49:16,257
Is there only pain

564
00:49:16,401 --> 00:49:17,766
And hatred

565
00:49:17,903 --> 00:49:19,894
And misery

566
00:49:21,139 --> 00:49:25,132
And each time
I feel like this inside

567
00:49:25,277 --> 00:49:28,769
There's one thing
I want to know

568
00:49:28,914 --> 00:49:33,715
What's so funny 'bout
peace, love and understanding

569
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:42,359
What's so funny 'bout
peace, love and understanding

570
00:49:43,728 --> 00:49:46,060
I'm winkin' at ya

571
00:49:46,197 --> 00:49:50,497
Gonna make you, make you
make you notice

572
00:49:51,770 --> 00:49:53,294
Gonna use my arms

573
00:49:54,439 --> 00:49:55,929
Gonna use my legs

574
00:49:56,074 --> 00:49:58,372
Gonna use my style

575
00:49:58,510 --> 00:50:01,775
Gonna use my sidestep

576
00:50:01,913 --> 00:50:04,108
Gonna use my fingers

577
00:50:04,249 --> 00:50:06,979
Gonna use my, my, my
My, my, my

578
00:50:07,118 --> 00:50:09,586
Imagination

579
00:50:09,721 --> 00:50:11,655
'Cause I'm

580
00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:13,883
Gonna make you see

581
00:50:14,025 --> 00:50:17,552
Nobody else here
No one like me

582
00:50:19,531 --> 00:50:21,931
— I'm special
- Special

583
00:50:22,067 --> 00:50:24,194
So special
Special?

584
00:50:24,336 --> 00:50:26,861
I gotta have some of your

585
00:50:27,005 --> 00:50:29,872
Attention
Give it to me

586
00:50:30,008 --> 00:50:32,670
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Bob Harris.

587
00:50:34,279 --> 00:50:36,247
Thanks. This is hard.

588
00:50:36,381 --> 00:50:38,315
Oh, Jesus.

589
00:50:44,356 --> 00:50:48,452
I could feel at the time

590
00:50:48,593 --> 00:50:52,051
There was no way of knowing

591
00:50:52,197 --> 00:50:55,928
Fallen leaves in the night

592
00:50:56,067 --> 00:50:59,969
Who can say
where they're blowin'

593
00:51:00,105 --> 00:51:02,869
As free as the wind

594
00:51:04,542 --> 00:51:06,976
Hopefully learnin'

595
00:51:07,112 --> 00:51:11,344
Why the sea on the tide

596
00:51:11,483 --> 00:51:14,816
Has no way of turnin'

597
00:51:18,123 --> 00:51:20,455
More than this

598
00:51:21,526 --> 00:51:26,088
You know there's nothing

599
00:51:26,231 --> 00:51:28,131
More than this

600
00:51:29,601 --> 00:51:33,002
Tell me one thing

601
00:51:33,138 --> 00:51:36,869
More than this

602
00:51:37,008 --> 00:51:41,638
Ooh, there's nothing

603
00:52:38,103 --> 00:52:41,834
Close my eyes

604
00:52:41,973 --> 00:52:45,500
Feel me now

605
00:52:45,643 --> 00:52:47,668
I don't know

606
00:52:47,812 --> 00:52:51,475
How you could
not love me now

607
00:52:53,118 --> 00:52:55,416
You will know

608
00:52:55,553 --> 00:52:59,011
With her feet down to the ground

609
00:53:00,592 --> 00:53:02,457
Over there

610
00:53:02,594 --> 00:53:06,724
And I want you, love, to know

611
00:53:07,966 --> 00:53:10,867
You can't hide

612
00:53:11,002 --> 00:53:13,368
Oh, no

613
00:53:13,505 --> 00:53:16,633
From the way I feel

614
00:55:21,699 --> 00:55:25,260
Hello.
Hey.

615
00:55:25,403 --> 00:55:27,268
Hello, Bob.

616
00:55:27,405 --> 00:55:31,364
Hey, you know, those carpet samples...
you were right about the burgundy.

617
00:55:31,509 --> 00:55:33,500
It wasn't even close.

618
00:55:33,645 --> 00:55:36,614
Blows the others away.
I'm glad you like it.

619
00:55:38,449 --> 00:55:42,943
I saw a great house tonight
that you would've loved, and...

620
00:55:43,087 --> 00:55:46,420
that burgundy would've been good
in this house, really. - Really?

621
00:55:46,557 --> 00:55:49,788
A guy designed his own house
and built it.

622
00:55:49,927 --> 00:55:51,792
Oh, yeah? I wish I'd seen it.

623
00:55:53,798 --> 00:55:58,030
He's a fashion guy.
All these fashion people were there.

624
00:55:58,169 --> 00:56:01,002
And, uh, there were
Japanese surfers there,

625
00:56:01,139 --> 00:56:05,974
and the guy was playing
really, really, really great music.

626
00:56:06,110 --> 00:56:08,237
I should've found out what it was
and brought some...

627
00:56:08,379 --> 00:56:10,244
I'll bring some back.
I'll try to find out.

628
00:56:10,381 --> 00:56:13,111
That sounds great.
Can you hold on?

629
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:18,085
You have to have something
for breakfast.

630
00:56:18,222 --> 00:56:21,521
Do you want some cereal?
Tell her I said she's gotta eat something.

631
00:56:21,659 --> 00:56:23,684
I'm just trying to get her
to eat something.

632
00:56:23,828 --> 00:56:26,422
Yeah. Tell her I said
she has to eat something.

633
00:56:26,564 --> 00:56:29,158
Your dad says eat something.
No.

634
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:34,397
Eat. Tell her I said so.
She won't eat anything. Forget it.

635
00:56:34,539 --> 00:56:36,404
Look, I'm glad you're having fun.

636
00:56:37,909 --> 00:56:41,811
It's not fun. It's just...
It's just very, very different.

637
00:56:41,946 --> 00:56:44,039
Maybe that's good.

638
00:56:44,182 --> 00:56:46,742
Um, I have to get
the kids off for school, okay?

639
00:56:46,884 --> 00:56:48,749
So, can I call you in a while?

640
00:56:50,388 --> 00:56:53,380
I might not be up.
It's-It's, like, 4:00.

641
00:56:54,959 --> 00:56:57,757
Well, you better get some sleep.
You have work in the morning.

642
00:56:57,895 --> 00:56:59,795
No, actually,
they gave me tomorrow off.

643
00:57:01,332 --> 00:57:03,664
That must be nice.

644
00:57:06,204 --> 00:57:09,037
All right. Well, thanks
for checking in. I gotta go.

645
00:57:09,173 --> 00:57:11,698
All right. Have a great, great night.
All right.

646
00:57:11,843 --> 00:57:14,903
I mean, I guess have a great morning, huh?

647
00:57:15,046 --> 00:57:18,038
Good night, Bob.
Good night.

648
00:57:18,182 --> 00:57:21,174
I love you.

649
00:57:23,855 --> 00:57:26,255
That was a stupid idea.

650
00:58:36,894 --> 00:58:39,226
I was feeling tight,
you know?

651
00:58:39,363 --> 00:58:41,263
Shoulders and neck.

652
00:58:41,399 --> 00:58:45,062
So I called down
and, and had a, uh,

653
00:58:45,203 --> 00:58:47,899
shiatsu massage in my room.
Mmm, that's nice.

654
00:58:48,039 --> 00:58:51,668
And the tightness has
completely, uh, disappeared...

655
00:58:51,809 --> 00:58:54,175
And been replaced by...

656
00:58:54,312 --> 00:58:56,177
unbelievable pain.

657
00:58:57,815 --> 00:59:00,545
Just staggering, unbearable pain.
Ooh, that's too bad.

658
00:59:00,685 --> 00:59:02,550
Yeah.
I'm in pain.

659
00:59:02,687 --> 00:59:07,090
I got my foot banged up, and...
Wanna see it?

660
00:59:07,225 --> 00:59:09,659
How do you say no?

661
00:59:09,794 --> 00:59:12,092
Oh, my gosh.
I know.

662
00:59:12,230 --> 00:59:14,698
That's... How...
When did you do this?

663
00:59:14,832 --> 00:59:17,096
I did it the other day.
It hurts, you know?

664
00:59:17,235 --> 00:59:20,363
Didn't you feel any pain? Your...
Yeah, it really hurt.

665
00:59:20,505 --> 00:59:22,735
It was...
Yeah. That toe is almost dead.

666
00:59:24,342 --> 00:59:27,436
I gotta take you to a doctor. You can't
just put that back in the shoe.

667
00:59:27,578 --> 00:59:29,443
No. I don't think so.

668
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:31,775
Well, you either go to a doctor,
or you leave it here.

669
00:59:33,918 --> 00:59:36,853
He's smiling.
You like that idea?

670
00:59:36,988 --> 00:59:38,853
See, they love black toe
over in this country.

671
00:59:38,990 --> 00:59:41,390
You got a sharp knife?

672
00:59:41,526 --> 00:59:45,360
Gotta be, you know, in this country...
somebody's gotta prefer a black toe.

673
00:59:45,496 --> 00:59:48,090
Uh, "brack" toe.

674
00:59:48,232 --> 00:59:51,099
Or we should probably hang around
until someone orders it.

675
00:59:51,235 --> 00:59:53,260
Hey, what's with the straight face?

676
00:59:53,871 --> 00:59:55,532
Hospital regulations.
Get in there.

677
00:59:55,673 --> 00:59:58,540
All right. Thank you.
All right.

678
01:00:01,145 --> 01:00:03,807
Careful, okay?
No, don't!

679
01:00:03,948 --> 01:00:06,883
No!
Hey, use the horn, fella.

680
01:00:11,789 --> 01:00:14,053
Let's try "mixed internal. "

681
01:00:14,191 --> 01:00:16,591
Yeah. Switched to beer, huh?
Go.

682
01:00:16,727 --> 01:00:18,627
Go. Go.
You might want to switch to sake.

683
01:00:18,763 --> 01:00:20,628
Stop.

684
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,100
Hi.

685
01:00:25,236 --> 01:00:27,101
Hi.
Hi.

686
01:00:27,238 --> 01:00:29,570
Yeah. We need a doctor.
Hai.

687
01:00:29,707 --> 01:00:31,868
For, uh, her...
emergency room.

688
01:00:32,009 --> 01:00:34,136
It's not an emergency.
I just hurt my foot.

689
01:00:41,819 --> 01:00:44,754
Okay, do we fill this out?
We go over there?

690
01:00:44,889 --> 01:00:46,754
Which number?

691
01:00:52,129 --> 01:00:54,859
We're not going to another hospital,
so whatever you say is okay.

692
01:00:54,999 --> 01:00:56,864
Okay.

693
01:00:57,001 --> 01:01:00,368
Could you put that back
in the garage for us?

694
01:01:29,634 --> 01:01:33,001
Irun desuka.

695
01:01:34,338 --> 01:01:38,001
"In desuka"?
Irun desuka.

696
01:01:43,648 --> 01:01:46,276
Nihon ni.

697
01:01:46,417 --> 01:01:48,351
Japan.

698
01:01:48,486 --> 01:01:51,114
Japan.
"Appuh. "

699
01:01:51,255 --> 01:01:53,189
Japan "appuh. "
Japan...

700
01:01:53,324 --> 01:01:55,884
"Appuh. " "Appuh. "
After?

701
01:01:56,027 --> 01:01:58,325
Japan...
"Appuh. " Nannen.

702
01:02:01,499 --> 01:02:03,933
"Nannen. "

703
01:02:07,438 --> 01:02:12,239
Ahh-ah, so.

704
01:02:22,486 --> 01:02:24,351
How's that song go?

705
01:02:37,068 --> 01:02:39,628
Is that for me?

706
01:02:39,770 --> 01:02:41,635
Yeah, it can be for you.

707
01:03:14,705 --> 01:03:16,570
Hey, Bob, it's Charlotte.

708
01:03:16,707 --> 01:03:20,768
Um, I'm going to meet Charlie and those guys
at this place called Orange around 10:00,

709
01:03:20,911 --> 01:03:23,573
so I'll fax you a map
on how to get there.

710
01:03:23,714 --> 01:03:26,945
I hope you can come
and meet us. Bye.

711
01:03:35,426 --> 01:03:37,826
Suckin'on my titties
like you wanted me

712
01:03:37,962 --> 01:03:40,430
Callin'me all the time
like Blondie

713
01:03:40,564 --> 01:03:43,328
Check out my Chrissie be-Hynde
It's fine all of the time

714
01:03:43,467 --> 01:03:45,332
Like sex on the beach is

715
01:03:45,469 --> 01:03:48,029
What else is in the Teaches of Peaches

716
01:03:48,172 --> 01:03:50,197
Huh, what

717
01:03:57,381 --> 01:03:59,747
Suckin'on my titties
like you wanted me

718
01:03:59,884 --> 01:04:02,546
Callin'me all the time like Blondie

719
01:04:02,686 --> 01:04:06,918
How long have you been here?
I couldn't say.

720
01:04:07,057 --> 01:04:09,150
Where's Charlie and those guys?

721
01:04:09,293 --> 01:04:13,127
Um, they're takin' a dance class.

722
01:04:13,264 --> 01:04:16,722
Why, what

723
01:04:21,105 --> 01:04:24,597
What, right

724
01:04:31,148 --> 01:04:33,173
Can I get you a couple drinks?
Let's go.

725
01:04:33,317 --> 01:04:35,308
Okay.
Okay.

726
01:04:35,452 --> 01:04:38,546
Like you wanted me
Callin'me all the time like Blondie
Thank you.

727
01:04:40,858 --> 01:04:43,088
He's got blockers.

728
01:04:44,161 --> 01:04:46,356
They've got room to run.

729
01:04:46,497 --> 01:04:49,057
He's cutting back.
He cut back.

730
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:51,065
He's dancin'. He's dancin'.
Where'd he go?

731
01:04:55,072 --> 01:04:57,404
There you are.

732
01:04:59,677 --> 01:05:01,838
Say "Hi. "

733
01:05:04,982 --> 01:05:06,847
Hi. You ready?

734
01:05:08,219 --> 01:05:10,585
Come on.

735
01:05:10,721 --> 01:05:13,451
Thank you, Tokyo!

736
01:05:13,591 --> 01:05:18,358
Nobody does it better

737
01:05:20,731 --> 01:05:25,191
Makes me feel sad for the rest

738
01:05:28,405 --> 01:05:30,873
Nobody does it

739
01:05:31,008 --> 01:05:33,772
Half as good as you

740
01:05:33,911 --> 01:05:37,608
Baby, you're

741
01:05:37,748 --> 01:05:40,376
The best
You two.

742
01:05:40,517 --> 01:05:42,781
Both of you.

743
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:45,252
I wasn't lookin'

744
01:05:45,389 --> 01:05:49,883
But somehow you found me

745
01:05:50,027 --> 01:05:55,522
I tried to hide
from your love, yeah

746
01:07:27,624 --> 01:07:29,922
No, no. Not here.

747
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:32,893
It must be over there.

748
01:07:47,444 --> 01:07:51,244
You know, the first time I saw you,
you were wearing a tuxedo at the bar.

749
01:07:51,382 --> 01:07:53,646
You were very dashing.

750
01:07:53,784 --> 01:07:55,752
I liked the mascara.

751
01:08:01,725 --> 01:08:04,091
But the first time I saw you
was in the elevator.

752
01:08:04,228 --> 01:08:06,856
Really?
You don't remember?

753
01:08:09,933 --> 01:08:14,029
I guess you do kind of blend in, huh?

754
01:08:14,171 --> 01:08:16,298
Did I scowl at you?

755
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:19,807
No, you smiled.
I did?

756
01:08:19,943 --> 01:08:23,242
Yes, it was a complete accident.
A freak. I haven't seen it since.

757
01:08:23,380 --> 01:08:26,110
Just that one time.
Like that, but bigger.

758
01:08:27,785 --> 01:08:30,549
Bigger. Yeah, big... big...

759
01:08:30,687 --> 01:08:33,417
Well, not that big.

760
01:08:33,557 --> 01:08:35,991
My goodness.

761
01:08:42,099 --> 01:08:45,694
Marcello, come here.
Hurry up.

762
01:08:49,573 --> 01:08:53,202
Why do they switch
the "R"s and the "L"s here?

763
01:08:53,343 --> 01:08:57,279
Oh, for yuks.
You know, just to mix it up.

764
01:08:57,414 --> 01:09:00,281
They have to amuse themselves.
'Cause we're not makin' 'em laugh.

765
01:09:04,054 --> 01:09:08,081
Let's never come here again,
'cause it would never be as much fun.

766
01:09:11,095 --> 01:09:13,290
Whatever you say.
You're the boss.

767
01:09:18,602 --> 01:09:20,968
I'm stuck.

768
01:09:23,807 --> 01:09:25,968
Does it get easier?

769
01:09:26,110 --> 01:09:28,135
No.

770
01:09:29,246 --> 01:09:31,373
Yes.

771
01:09:31,515 --> 01:09:33,608
It gets easier.

772
01:09:33,750 --> 01:09:35,615
Oh, yeah?

773
01:09:35,752 --> 01:09:37,720
Look at you.

774
01:09:38,856 --> 01:09:40,756
Thanks.

775
01:09:42,226 --> 01:09:44,353
The more you know
who you are,

776
01:09:44,495 --> 01:09:46,588
and what you want,

777
01:09:46,730 --> 01:09:49,494
the less you let...

778
01:09:49,633 --> 01:09:51,760
things upset you.

779
01:09:52,836 --> 01:09:54,701
Yeah.

780
01:09:55,873 --> 01:09:58,239
I just don't know
what I'm supposed to be.

781
01:09:59,309 --> 01:10:01,243
You know?

782
01:10:01,378 --> 01:10:03,243
I tried being a writer, but...

783
01:10:03,380 --> 01:10:05,245
I hate what I write.

784
01:10:05,382 --> 01:10:09,182
And I tried taking pictures,

785
01:10:09,319 --> 01:10:12,550
but they're so mediocre,
you know.

786
01:10:12,689 --> 01:10:16,523
Every girl goes through
a photography phase.

787
01:10:16,660 --> 01:10:19,220
You know, like horses?

788
01:10:19,363 --> 01:10:23,265
You know?
Take, uh, dumb pictures of your feet.

789
01:10:25,936 --> 01:10:29,133
You'll figure that out.

790
01:10:29,273 --> 01:10:31,798
I'm not worried about you.

791
01:10:34,444 --> 01:10:36,309
Keep writing.

792
01:10:41,051 --> 01:10:43,349
But I'm so mean.

793
01:10:44,688 --> 01:10:47,623
Mean's okay.
Yeah?

794
01:10:53,797 --> 01:10:56,129
What about marriage?
Does that get easier?

795
01:11:03,373 --> 01:11:05,568
That's hard.

796
01:11:10,614 --> 01:11:12,878
We used to have
a lot of fun.

797
01:11:13,984 --> 01:11:16,976
Lydia would come with me
when I made the movies,

798
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:20,112
and we would laugh
about it all.

799
01:11:22,259 --> 01:11:24,659
Now she doesn't want
to leave the kids, and...

800
01:11:24,795 --> 01:11:27,593
she doesn't...

801
01:11:27,731 --> 01:11:30,791
need me to be there.

802
01:11:30,934 --> 01:11:34,165
The kids miss me,
but they're fine.

803
01:11:36,907 --> 01:11:40,934
It gets a whole lot more complicated
when you have kids.

804
01:11:41,078 --> 01:11:43,069
Yeah. It's scary.

805
01:11:46,516 --> 01:11:49,952
It's the most terrifying day of your life
the day the first one is born.

806
01:11:51,154 --> 01:11:53,782
Yeah. Nobody ever tells you that.

807
01:11:55,192 --> 01:11:57,285
Your life,

808
01:11:57,427 --> 01:11:59,292
as you know it,

809
01:11:59,429 --> 01:12:01,954
is gone.

810
01:12:02,099 --> 01:12:03,964
Never to return.

811
01:12:06,003 --> 01:12:08,836
But they learn how to walk,
and they learn how to talk, and...

812
01:12:10,407 --> 01:12:13,467
and you want to be with them.

813
01:12:14,544 --> 01:12:16,910
And they turn out to be the most...

814
01:12:17,047 --> 01:12:19,174
delightful people...

815
01:12:19,316 --> 01:12:21,181
you will ever meet in your life.

816
01:12:21,318 --> 01:12:23,548
Hmm, that's nice.

817
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,665
Where'd you grow up?

818
01:12:39,936 --> 01:12:42,837
Um, I grew up in New York,

819
01:12:42,973 --> 01:12:45,942
and I moved to Los Angeles
when John and I got married.

820
01:12:46,076 --> 01:12:49,944
But it's so different there.

821
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:52,548
Yeah, I know.

822
01:12:53,884 --> 01:12:56,250
John thinks I'm so snotty.

823
01:13:01,158 --> 01:13:03,023
Hmm.

824
01:13:16,606 --> 01:13:18,471
You're not hopeless.

825
01:16:43,613 --> 01:16:45,478
Hello?

826
01:16:45,615 --> 01:16:47,947
Mr. Harris? A fax for you.
Yes.

827
01:16:48,084 --> 01:16:50,348
Okay.
Can you send it up?

828
01:16:50,487 --> 01:16:53,945
Do you think you can kick it under
the door, slide it under the door, please?

829
01:16:54,090 --> 01:16:57,253
Do you want I send it to your room?
Just slide it under the door, please.

830
01:16:57,394 --> 01:17:00,795
Thank you. Okay. All right, bye.
Thank you, Mr. Harris.

831
01:17:35,599 --> 01:17:39,467
Hey, Ms. Kawasaki.
It's Bob Harris.

832
01:17:39,603 --> 01:17:43,334
Yes, I would love
to do his talk show.

833
01:17:43,473 --> 01:17:45,338
I would.

834
01:17:45,475 --> 01:17:48,205
I would love
to change my plans and stay.

835
01:18:05,996 --> 01:18:07,861
American movie star.

836
01:18:14,604 --> 01:18:16,697
Ladies and gentlemen,

837
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:19,934
Mr. Bob Harris!

838
01:18:20,076 --> 01:18:23,045
Come on!
Da de da de, da de da dah.

839
01:18:23,179 --> 01:18:27,309
Da de da dah!
Whoo!

840
01:18:27,450 --> 01:18:29,315
Come on, Bob.
Come on, Bob.

841
01:18:29,452 --> 01:18:31,647
Bobby, come on!
Bobby, come on!

842
01:18:31,788 --> 01:18:34,382
Whoo! Nice to meet you.

843
01:18:37,761 --> 01:18:40,355
He said you guys are
e-mailing together.

844
01:18:47,570 --> 01:18:49,834
Ah. He wants to
show you his dance.

845
01:18:49,973 --> 01:18:52,237
Japanese dance step.
Uh... Uh... Japanese dance.

846
01:18:52,375 --> 01:18:54,240
Do I... Do I have to
dance with him?

847
01:18:54,377 --> 01:18:56,572
To-tung a-tung. To-tung a-tung.

848
01:18:56,713 --> 01:18:59,273
To-tung a-tung. To-tung a-tung

849
01:18:59,416 --> 01:19:02,249
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby...

850
01:19:03,319 --> 01:19:06,777
Welcome, Bob. He was saying, "Welcome, Bob."
What?

851
01:19:46,429 --> 01:19:48,294
Hello?
Bob?

852
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:53,628
Hi, Lydia.
Is this a bad time?

853
01:19:54,738 --> 01:19:57,104
No, it's always a good time.

854
01:19:57,240 --> 01:20:00,232
Look, um, your burgundy carpet
isn't in stock.

855
01:20:00,376 --> 01:20:03,777
It's gonna take 12 weeks.
Did you like any of the other colors?

856
01:20:07,717 --> 01:20:11,244
Whatever you like.
I-I'm completely lost.

857
01:20:11,387 --> 01:20:13,252
It's just carpet.

858
01:20:14,691 --> 01:20:17,922
That's not what I'm talking about.
What are you talking about?

859
01:20:20,797 --> 01:20:23,391
I don't know.
I just want to get healthy.

860
01:20:23,533 --> 01:20:26,263
You know, I want to take
better care of myself.

861
01:20:26,402 --> 01:20:29,337
I would like to start
eating healthier.

862
01:20:29,472 --> 01:20:31,599
I don't want all that pasta.

863
01:20:31,741 --> 01:20:33,606
What?

864
01:20:33,743 --> 01:20:36,644
I would like to start eating,
like, Japanese food.

865
01:20:38,014 --> 01:20:40,949
Well, why don't you just stay there,
and you can have it every day?

866
01:20:46,489 --> 01:20:49,049
How are the kids doin'?

867
01:20:49,192 --> 01:20:51,752
They're fine.
They miss their father.

868
01:20:51,895 --> 01:20:54,955
But they're getting used to
you not being here.

869
01:20:55,098 --> 01:20:57,089
Do I need to worry
about you, Bob?

870
01:20:59,169 --> 01:21:01,034
Only if you want to.

871
01:21:02,539 --> 01:21:05,269
Bob, I got things to do.

872
01:21:05,408 --> 01:21:07,706
I gotta go.
Okay.

873
01:21:09,512 --> 01:21:11,673
I'll see you...
I mean, I'll talk to you later.

874
01:21:11,815 --> 01:21:15,478
Okay.
Okay, bye.

875
01:21:15,618 --> 01:21:17,483
Bye.

876
01:21:56,693 --> 01:22:00,151
Matthew Smellick!

877
01:22:00,296 --> 01:22:04,198
Matthew "Snellick. "

878
01:22:10,573 --> 01:22:12,370
Thank you. Thank you so much.

879
01:22:12,508 --> 01:22:15,136
We'll take a really short break,
and we'll see you in a minute.

880
01:22:21,784 --> 01:22:24,981
Hi. Uh, champagne.
Thanks.

881
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:32,625
Hi.

882
01:22:49,379 --> 01:22:52,507
Midnight at the oasis

883
01:22:52,649 --> 01:22:55,083
Send your camel to bed

884
01:22:55,218 --> 01:22:58,779
Shadows paintin'our faces

885
01:22:58,922 --> 01:23:04,053
Traces of romance in our heads

886
01:23:04,193 --> 01:23:07,651
Heaven's holding a half moon

887
01:23:11,968 --> 01:23:13,833
I got it.

888
01:23:16,339 --> 01:23:18,466
Have a rough night?

889
01:23:21,144 --> 01:23:24,045
Um, I'm going to that place,
that sushi place in Daikanyama.

890
01:23:24,180 --> 01:23:26,808
You wanna come?
Yeah, but I can't right now.

891
01:23:28,952 --> 01:23:31,819
Midnight at the oasis

892
01:23:31,955 --> 01:23:34,515
Send your camel to bed
Yeah, I guess you're busy, huh?

893
01:23:34,657 --> 01:23:38,354
Shadows paintin'our faces

894
01:23:38,494 --> 01:23:41,657
Traces of romance in our heads

895
01:23:47,737 --> 01:23:50,934
Hello?
Hello? Bob, it's me.

896
01:23:51,074 --> 01:23:54,407
Hello?
It's Lydia, your wife.

897
01:23:54,544 --> 01:23:56,842
Oh, I'm...
I couldn't hear ya.

898
01:23:56,980 --> 01:24:00,279
Hey, you want to talk to Zoe?
Yeah.

899
01:24:00,416 --> 01:24:02,350
Zoe, come say hello
to your father.

900
01:24:02,485 --> 01:24:04,817
No. Uh, she just ran into
the other room.

901
01:24:04,954 --> 01:24:07,354
It's okay. It's okay.

902
01:24:07,490 --> 01:24:10,857
Okay, um, her ballet recital
is Sunday. Don't forget.

903
01:24:10,994 --> 01:24:12,859
I didn't forget.

904
01:24:12,996 --> 01:24:15,624
Well, travel safely.
I'll see you soon.

905
01:24:15,765 --> 01:24:18,256
Mommy!
Okay.

906
01:24:18,401 --> 01:24:20,733
Okay. Bye.

907
01:24:20,870 --> 01:24:22,861
Bye.

908
01:24:33,182 --> 01:24:36,242
Well, she is closer
to your age.

909
01:24:37,754 --> 01:24:39,949
You could talk about things
you have in common,

910
01:24:40,089 --> 01:24:41,954
like, um,

911
01:24:42,091 --> 01:24:43,956
growing up in the '50s.

912
01:24:44,093 --> 01:24:47,358
Maybe she liked the movies
you were making in the '70s,

913
01:24:47,497 --> 01:24:50,057
when you still were making movies.

914
01:24:50,199 --> 01:24:53,532
Wasn't there anyone else there
to lavish you with attention?

915
01:25:02,278 --> 01:25:04,678
I'm switchin' to beer.
Okay?

916
01:25:04,814 --> 01:25:06,679
Biru?

917
01:25:09,786 --> 01:25:12,186
I can't tell the difference.

918
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:19,094
We'll have
two of these, okay?

919
01:26:12,315 --> 01:26:15,113
To your nearest exit...

920
01:26:15,251 --> 01:26:18,379
and leave the building.

921
01:26:18,521 --> 01:26:21,957
Await instructions
from the authorities.

922
01:26:43,346 --> 01:26:45,871
That was the worst lunch.

923
01:26:46,015 --> 01:26:48,279
So bad.

924
01:26:48,417 --> 01:26:51,147
What kind of restaurant
makes you cook your own food?

925
01:26:57,793 --> 01:26:59,920
When are you leaving?

926
01:27:02,665 --> 01:27:04,565
Tomorrow.

927
01:27:08,671 --> 01:27:10,536
I'll miss you.

928
01:27:23,519 --> 01:27:27,046
I'm so into you

929
01:27:37,466 --> 01:27:40,594
When you walked into the room

930
01:27:41,737 --> 01:27:44,638
There was voodoo in the vibes

931
01:27:48,878 --> 01:27:51,676
I was captured by your style

932
01:27:52,848 --> 01:27:56,045
But I could not
catch your eyes

933
01:28:01,557 --> 01:28:04,549
I don't want to leave.

934
01:28:04,694 --> 01:28:06,992
So don't.
Stay here with me.

935
01:28:08,965 --> 01:28:10,990
We'll start a jazz band.

936
01:28:15,805 --> 01:28:19,241
I am so into you, baby

937
01:28:40,963 --> 01:28:42,828
Good night.
Good night. Okay.

938
01:28:42,965 --> 01:28:45,160
Good night.

939
01:28:53,576 --> 01:28:55,601
Okay.

940
01:28:55,745 --> 01:28:57,610
Okay. Good night.
Good night.

941
01:29:31,514 --> 01:29:34,381
Good morning, Mr. Harris. Have a nice flight.
Thank you.

942
01:29:34,517 --> 01:29:36,382
Thank you.
Good-bye

943
01:29:37,687 --> 01:29:39,552
I'll be one minute.

944
01:29:49,899 --> 01:29:53,630
Charlotte, I'm down in the lobby,
and I'm leaving now.

945
01:29:53,769 --> 01:29:56,237
Um, I was calling...

946
01:29:56,372 --> 01:29:58,237
to see if you still
have my jacket.

947
01:29:58,374 --> 01:30:00,672
If you could you bring it down,
but you're not there,

948
01:30:00,810 --> 01:30:04,906
so this is good-bye,
and, uh...

949
01:30:06,782 --> 01:30:09,250
So,

950
01:30:09,385 --> 01:30:12,946
I guess, good-bye and enjoy
my jacket which you stole...

951
01:30:13,089 --> 01:30:14,954
from me.

952
01:30:21,764 --> 01:30:23,789
Hello.
Hello.

953
01:30:23,933 --> 01:30:26,561
How are you?
I'm good. How are you?

954
01:30:26,702 --> 01:30:28,567

964
01:31:10,479 --> 01:31:14,745
All right. Aren't you gonna wish me
"Have a good 'fright,"' or something?

965

Listen to the girl

976
01:34:11,560 --> 01:34:15,690
As she takes on half the world

977
01:34:15,831 --> 01:34:19,733
Moving up and so alive

978
01:34:19,868 --> 01:34:23,634
In her honey dripping

979
01:34:23,772 --> 01:34:25,672
Beehive

980
01:34:27,676 --> 01:34:31,442
Beehive
It's good, so good

981

All right.

So good

983
01:34:40,356 --> 01:34:42,950
Walking back to you

984
01:34:43,092 --> 01:34:46,152
Is the hardest thing that

985
01:34:47,229 --> 01:34:50,995

I'll be your plastic toy

990

For you

991
01:35:11,687 --> 01:35:14,622
Eating up the scum

992
01:35:14,757 --> 01:35:17,419
