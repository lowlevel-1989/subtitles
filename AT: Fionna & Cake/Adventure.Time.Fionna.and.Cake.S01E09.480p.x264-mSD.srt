1
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:57,140
Where...

2
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:10,860
Hey, girl.

3
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,400
Ellis P?

4
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,780
Look at me. I'm even
more beautiful now.

5
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,910
Chase me, Stanley.

6
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,660
Wait. Where's Cake?

7
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,410
Fionna!

8
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:23,120
Fionna!

9
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,160
Cake!

10
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:27,040
It worked.

11
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,330
Simon did it.

12
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,040
Let's go to our house.

13
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:33,500
Yeah. We can throw a party.

14
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,550
Yah!

15
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:41,180
I feel snacky.

16
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,890
People eat cake
at parties, right?

17
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,680
Let's get one from BB's.

18
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,190
Ooh.

19
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,900
Gary? Are you here?

20
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,240
We're throwing a party.

21
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,700
Gary?

22
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,080
Fionna.

23
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,790
You're back.

24
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,580
Try my new pastry.

25
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,620
Huh?

26
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,590
It's you!

27
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,760
Marshall?

28
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,270
Our building.

29
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,650
No, no. Don't
do it, Stanley.

30
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,740
My spaghetti!

31
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,660
Wait! I'm too
pretty to get eat!

32
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,780
Aah!

33
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,670
Okay, we're safe now.

34
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,130
I'll put in a video game.

35
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,670
You go make us margaritas

36
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,420
I've always wanted
to try one of those.

37
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,470
Are you happy, Fionna?

38
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:09,520
All this for you.

39
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,190
Fionna.

40
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:16,270
Fionna, wake up.

41
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,940
You alright?

42
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,950
It's... It's... normal.

43
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,320
Yeah, I know.

44
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,070
I had the worst dream.

45
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,830
When Simon put on the crown,

46
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,040
it all went wrong.

47
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,910
Gary became a scary gum
blob, and Marshall Lee was

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,250
a hideous monster that burst into flames.
Hideous monster that burst into flames.

49
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,670
Yeah. Did you see

50
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,460
Simon in the freezer?
Simon in the freezer!

51
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,510
What if it was an omen?

52
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,390
It was just a nightmare.

53
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,350
I can't wait for
this dump to change.

54
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:49,720
Look at that. It
even has lip sync.

55
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,270
Can I help you?

56
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,190
We didn't know this
rink had a mascot.

57
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,570
Ooh. My butt is an icicle.

58
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,870
Whoa.

59
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,370
Hey, get off the ice.

60
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,410
No skates, no entry.

61
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,670
Yeah, yeah. I'm going.

62
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,960
Whoa-oa.

63
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,130
Pbht!

64
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:21,380
This place is gonna
be magic soon,

65
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:25,050
I can feel it.

66
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,180
There.

67
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,350
That squirrel is reading.

68
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:31,430
Magic.

69
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,890
False alarm.

70
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,480
Marshall and Gary?

71
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,230
Fionna.

72
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,150
Cool threads. You
been thrifting?

73
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:46,240
What... What... What is this?

74
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,370
Fionna, where have you been?

75
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,240
You just disappeared.

76
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,830
Okay, this is gonna
blow your mind,

77
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:55,170
but our whole world is
inside this guy Simon's head,

78
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:59,790
and everything we know is
about to turn crazy magical.

79
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,760
Any second now.

80
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,800
Simon, what's the hold up?

81
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:21,440
The crown.

82
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,910
Where am I?

83
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,040
Scared of the darkness that
lay before your eyes...

84
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,450
You.

85
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,620
Hey! Lich!

86
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,790
What did you do
to my spell, huh?

87
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,300
Great embodiment of chaos,

88
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,670
hear me.

89
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,970
For ages untold I
studied your ways,

90
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:50,260
devoting my existence to you.

91
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,470
I strove to be your vassal
on the physical plane,

92
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,730
to build mountains of
bodies in your honor,

93
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,520
to extinguish all life,

94
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,820
and in my universe,
this I achieved.

95
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,570
But it gave me no satisfaction.

96
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:11,490
In succeeding, I
lost all purpose.

97
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:13,490
I know what you mean. Why?

98
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,830
Why must this be?

99
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,710
Hear me, Golb.

100
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,790
GOLB?

101
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:35,640
Betty, are you in there?

102
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,520
Even a little?

103
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,230
I finally get to you
when I'm not even trying.

104
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:45,940
I've... I've wanted to
see you again for so long.

105
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,240
No, no, no.

106
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,530
Answer me.

107
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:50,530
What more could I have done?

108
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:53,870
What do you want from me now?

109
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,120
What?

110
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:20,600
Betty, I really
tried to fix you.

111
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:24,900
I searched for years for
a way to undo this...

112
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:29,570
but I failed.

113
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:31,240
Living among the humans in Ooo,

114
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:35,410
I felt completely out
of place and time.

115
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:38,830
My life had been
drained of all meaning.

116
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,080
You gave me a second chance,

117
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:45,460
and I've wasted it.

118
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,420
I'm sorry.

119
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,590
I'm so sorry, Betty.

120
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,340
When I first did the ritual,

121
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:59,310
I just wanted to come
here and tell you that

122
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:02,390
but then something
else happened.

123
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:08,730
I met two people who really
needed my help, Fionna and Cake.

124
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,820
You would have liked them.

125
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:14,410
They'll use a second chance
better than I ever did.

126
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:18,950
You of all people should
understand why I must do this.

127
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,120
I finally have a purpose now.

128
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,800
By the order
of Gibbon, find them!

129
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:33,380
This way.

130
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:35,390
Halt!

131
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,890
Ugh!

132
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:49,360
Shoot. Hey, Beth,

133
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,110
launch me.

134
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,450
Ye-e-e-e-ah!

135
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,280
Oof!

136
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,870
Come on, Beth.

137
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,160
On it.

138
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,460
Yeah.

139
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,250
Keep it coming.

140
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,420
Look out!

141
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,310
- Vandals!
- You wont get away with this!

142
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:23,100
Gibbon doesn't forgive!

143
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,850
Huh?

144
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:25,770
Ugh!

145
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,900
Yeah, that was great.

146
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,610
Good technique on those
little stink lines, Shermy.

147
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,910
Step four of the revolution...

148
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,820
check.

149
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,710
Ha! Nyah! Nyah!
Take that, Gibbon!

150
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:48,790
And that!

151
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,040
Oh! You got me!

152
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,130
Tell my kids... I resent them.

153
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:55,760
Quit wiggling
around, you nugget,

154
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,680
or you're walkin'.

155
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,890
If I'm going to the library,

156
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,720
you're going to
have to carry me.

157
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:08,060
I finally have a purpose now.

158
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,520
You just got real weird there.

159
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,230
Shermy? Wha?! Aah!

160
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,280
Your legs aren't
broken. You can walk.

161
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:27,080
What just happened?

162
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,420
I'm in another weird
version of Ooo.

163
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,250
Bread balls! Language.

164
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,760
Betty, why did you send me here?

165
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,760
And in this body?

166
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,430
Why, why, why?

167
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,640
Shermy...

168
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,680
are you going through puberty?

169
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,770
This is going to
sound farfetched,

170
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:47,680
but I'm not Shermy.

171
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:49,890
My name is Simon Petrikov.

172
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:53,690
I'm from another world far
different than your own.

173
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,280
Okay, "Simon."

174
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,450
You're not getting out
of going to the library

175
00:10:58,490 --> 00:10:59,820
by acting weird.

176
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,240
Library? That's
great, actually.

177
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,200
I could really use
a library right now.

178
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,700
Are you making fun of me?

179
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:09,460
No, no, no. I
love the library.

180
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:14,130
Okay. I like this new you.

181
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:16,840
Fionna and Cake are still
waiting for their magic world.

182
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,340
I'll find myself another crown.

183
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:22,680
You can zap me to whatever
alternate universe you want,

184
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,220
but I have free will.

185
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,310
Do you hear me,
Betty? Do you...

186
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,390
Hear me, Betty?

187
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,310
Do you hear me, Betty?

188
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,840
I keep
stepping on my tail.

189
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,010
Ugh, this will take
some getting used to.

190
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:03,840
Stay out of this.

191
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,850
Ooh, sparkly.

192
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:09,850
What's the matter, Simon?

193
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,350
Spell malfunction?

194
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,020
I'm a professional,

195
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,520
and professionals
don't hold grudges.

196
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:36,380
Aah!

197
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,640
So you're not a robot?

198
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,600
You're a magic cat?

199
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,680
Yes, I always was.

200
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,390
I'm just back to
my original form.

201
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,230
And pretty soon,
you will be, too.

202
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,320
But if everything's
gonna change,

203
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,490
will we still be together?

204
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:04,740
Uh... maybe?

205
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,240
In the world we all came from,

206
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:09,830
Gary was a candy prince,
and you were a cool vampire.

207
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:12,040
- Sick.
- Vampire?

208
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,290
Well, we did see a world
where versions of y'all

209
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:17,040
tried to kill each other,
so there's that option.

210
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,750
Fionna and I got into a
big fight in that place.

211
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,960
Hey, hey, don't worry.

212
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:24,760
We smoothed it over.

213
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,220
Honestly, I don't know if
you'll even remember each other.

214
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:32,140
Or if anyone will remember
this version of our world.

215
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,020
But I don't want
to forget anything.

216
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,890
Marshall and I just met.

217
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,270
Yeah.

218
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:40,610
Oh, I told you it shouldn't
be up to us to decide.

219
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:42,320
Pbht!

220
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,070
Maybe we can make requests.

221
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:46,200
That Simon guy's thoughts
affect our world, right?

222
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,070
Yeah, like, if Simon
knows Marshall and I

223
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:51,830
are supposed to be
together, it could work out?

224
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:55,040
And I'd still date you
if you were a vampire.

225
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,790
It's worth a shot.
Simon can do anything.

226
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,290
Just gotta find a portal.

227
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,800
B.R.B.

228
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,550
Blue sparkles.

229
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,800
Blue sparkles.

230
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,220
There.

231
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,430
Portal.

232
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:13,930
Can you hear me, Simon?

233
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,230
Big damn bugs.

234
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,320
The Scarab.

235
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,990
Just
leave us alone.

236
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,660
So is this part
of the fun magic?

237
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,170
Whoa!

238
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:43,670
Two scoops in five cones?

239
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:46,460
I'll see what I can do.

240
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,510
Aah!

241
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,630
Danger.

242
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,810
Oh, no.

243
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:56,390
Simon, what's going on?

244
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,730
Have there been any significant
ice events in this world?

245
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,020
Not recently.

246
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,440
Who has the magic crown now?

247
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:06,610
What crown?

248
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,700
It's gold and pointy,
set with red gems...

249
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:11,200
Shh. We have to be quiet now.

250
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:21,920
Where's the books?

251
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,710
Shh.

252
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,630
Uh...

253
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,340
What are you waiting for?

254
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:36,140
Whoa.

255
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:41,060
Come on. One of these has to be
about ice magic or the crown.

256
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,440
Psst. Just
throw some down.

257
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,360
Preferably something
about high technology,

258
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:49,030
transcendental meditation,
or trashy romance.

259
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,450
Yes.

260
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,170
Uh, Simon, we should go.

261
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,290
Just a minute.

262
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:08,960
Don't you hear it?

263
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,800
Euripides.

264
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,090
Sherm... Simon.

265
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,890
Aah!

266
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:19,100
Pagelings.

267
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,600
Return your books.

268
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,440
Aah.

269
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:28,110
I need that book.

270
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,420
- Show us your card.
- Show us your card.

271
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:47,710
- Return your books!
- Return your books!

272
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,050
This is not working out.

273
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,640
Ugh, that's so annoying.

274
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:01,310
Ugh, keep them apart.

275
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,980
Gimme that.

276
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,110
Aah! Hunter.

277
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:12,150
I love all plants and animals,

278
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,820
but not these things.

279
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,290
Got it.

280
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:25,120
Hey, Scarabs.

281
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:26,170
Huh? Huh?

282
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:28,460
I got your dumb crystal.

283
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,500
Come and get it.

284
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,850
I can feel their
little, tiny feet.

285
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,360
Ugh.

286
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,860
I shoulda kept up the
medicine-ball routines.

287
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,660
Come on, Prismo.

288
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,370
He-hey! Who needs a gym?

289
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:08,120
Gotta help
Fionna and Ca-a-a-ke.

290
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:24,060
I need a bath.

291
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,600
So if this Scarab reforms,

292
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,730
he's going to destroy
our entire reality?

293
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:29,770
Mm-hmm.

294
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,980
And we can't kill him
because he's immortal?

295
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:38,070
A Godlike being outdone by
a humble cheese-ball barrel.

296
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,570
So, do we just
keep them in jars,

297
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,530
like forever?

298
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,200
Will they still try to kill
us when the world resets?

299
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,960
I don't know.

300
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,250
I don't even know what's
going on with Simon

301
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:52,420
or why the Scarab got in.

302
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,460
Mm, Simon must still be alive,

303
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,670
or else we'd be blinked
out of existence.

304
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:01,760
Hmph. What'd you
bugs do to Simon?

305
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,720
Abominations!

306
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:11,060
Ugh!

307
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,110
Just call him.

308
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,110
Huh?

309
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,440
I gave him my phone.

310
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,940
You know, to play "Worm"
when he was all alone.

311
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,900
That's my phone.

312
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,320
Can I borrow this?

313
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,030
Oh, wait, the pass
code is... Shh. I know.

314
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,620
Huh?

315
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,910
It's ringing.

316
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:27,450
Beth, Beth.

317
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,420
Beth, where's the
book? I wanna see...

318
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,290
The book! I need
to see the book.

319
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,340
We're almost to the
ol' reading spot.

320
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,010
Which one's got
you so worked up?

321
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,430
Ah.

322
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:49,230
"Ancient Artifacts"
written by...

323
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,730
I can't read the author's name.

324
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:53,440
What luck... this
world's Simon Petrikov

325
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,320
wrote a history
of the crown, too.

326
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,650
The invisible forces
of the universe

327
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,530
must have wanted

328
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:02,740
me to find this.

329
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:03,660
That's not how you...

330
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,160
I
know how to read.

331
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,870
I have degrees.

332
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,000
Ugh!

333
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,460
Chill.

334
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,920
Why do you want to
read this one so badly?

335
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,170
The fate of my friends depends
on me finding a magic crown,

336
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:21,050
and that is the best chance
I have of locating it.

337
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:22,340
They're waiting.

338
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,850
They're waiting for
their magical...

339
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:28,180
Oh.

340
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,350
Okay, Simon.

341
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:31,520
Let's save your friends, then.

342
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:36,360
Ah.

343
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,860
"Ready for adventure?"

344
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,360
This looks like one of those
choose-your-own-choice deals.

345
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:46,490
Oh, like the ancient
game books of my world.

346
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:50,870
"Fire once for yes.
Fire twice for no."

347
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:55,750
"This is the story about
two best friends...

348
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,460
Casper and Nova.

349
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:00,260
They are both great explorers.

350
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,880
We meet them on
their great quest

351
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,970
to document and preserve
important talismans.

352
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:07,050
They journey through
the Gobblebad Caverns

353
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,810
and lodge near a sunken city
in the seaside town of Scandia.

354
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:14,270
There they hear a rumor
about a magic crown."

355
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,600
The crown.

356
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:17,690
"A crown guarded by
a deadly fire tiger

357
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:20,900
who lives atop the
volcanic mountain of Yag."

358
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,030
"Yog?" "Yag."

359
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,490
"Casper wants to go for it.

360
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:26,410
Nova is really excited
to search for artifacts

361
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:28,870
in the nearby ancient sea ruins,

362
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:33,540
but she would be cool with
going with Casper's plan, too.

363
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,290
Which thing should they explore?

364
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:37,380
Fire once for Casper's quest.

365
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,290
Fire twice for Nova's."

366
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,800
We have to go for the crown.

367
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,260
I don't know. The sea
ruins could be fun, too.

368
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,260
Finding the crown is a literal
matter of life and death

369
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:49,430
for a whole world
of living souls!

370
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:51,430
I'm digging the
commitment to this bit.

371
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:53,270
Casper, then.

372
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,270
"Casper is bitten, and the
crown has already been stolen

373
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,980
by moon demons." Dang it.

374
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:05,110
Maybe we can go back and
try the sea-ruins route.

375
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,910
Good idea.

376
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,580
"Casper is bitten, and the
crown has already been stolen."

377
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:16,920
No do-overs with
this book, I guess.

378
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,300
Where are the games
on this thing?

379
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,050
Hmm.

380
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:27,930
Eh, I'm watching TV.

381
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:33,520
Leave a
message. Blehh.

382
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,810
Ugh,
either the phone isn't working

383
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:38,810
or Simon is too hurt to answer.

384
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,820
What would the barflies from
"Cheers' do in this situation?

385
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,650
"Cheers" is filmed before
a live studio audience.

386
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,200
Somebody left the door open.

387
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,660
Hey, I'm walkin here.

388
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:55,200
I'm gonna go back
through the portal.

389
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,960
The blue sparkles again?

390
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,290
Hey, I saw a glowing
opening with blue sparkles,

391
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:01,960
out there in the park.

392
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,500
I'll take you there.

393
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,210
Let's go, Cake.

394
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,340
We'll look, too. Really?

395
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:10,180
We can cover more ground if we
look for portals everywhere.

396
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:14,140
I could even call my...
mom, if we have to.

397
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:29,990
Oh, my gob! What are you doing

398
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:32,450
to these beautiful creatures?!

399
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,200
Be free, my babies!

400
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,700
Be free!

401
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,210
Freedom! Ah-ha-ha-ha!

402
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:42,630
I saved you!

403
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:44,880
Does everybody know
where they're headed?
