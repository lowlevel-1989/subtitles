1
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,400
Unholy things,
give us that crown.

2
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,900
B-bwow!

3
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,410
Shwa-zaah!

4
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:19,740
Nova, that was amazing.

5
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,120
Aw, I just cast the
spell you showed me.

6
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,960
Moon Demon King.

7
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,040
Too late, Casper.

8
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,550
I'm going to an
undisclosed third location.

9
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,100
Thwarted again.

10
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:46,020
I could summon a
sun-ship to give chase.

11
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,600
Hmm. I think we should
check the launch pad

12
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,190
for clues about
where he's headed.

13
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,940
Yeah, that sounds smart, too.

14
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,030
What do you think we should do?

15
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:59,780
"Fire once for Casper's idea.
Fire twice for Nova's idea."

16
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:04,790
Ugh, every time we get close,
the crown gets further away.

17
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:07,210
This book cheats.

18
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,250
"Simon," I know you're
really into this story,

19
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:15,090
but if you're not enjoying
yourself, you can just stop.

20
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:17,380
That's the great
thing about books.

21
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,380
No.

22
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,470
Yoo-hoo!

23
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:23,350
Bloo-bloo-bloo.

24
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,850
Gimme that thingus, dingus.

25
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,940
You? Get outta
here, Choose Goose.

26
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,520
Silly boy.

27
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,820
The geese are long gone.
Now is the era of...

28
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,070
Pawn Swan.

29
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,320
Get outta here!

30
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:50,580
Goldang geese!

31
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,330
What's got into you?

32
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,630
We love Pawn Swan.

33
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:57,880
Look, I know
this is hard to understand,

34
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,890
but I have to decode the
secrets of this book.

35
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,800
I have to.

36
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,260
I have to.

37
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,770
I have to.

38
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,560
I have to.

39
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,560
I have to stop the Scarab.

40
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,200
Crossovers.

41
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,280
Crud. Oh, no, he's hot.

42
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,830
He ruined our house. Aah!

43
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,250
Hey, man.

44
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,330
I'm sorry we put you
in a bunch of jars,

45
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,380
uh, but we're back
in our world now

46
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,300
so it's all good, right?

47
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,010
Ow!

48
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:44,300
All the worlds you've visited,

49
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,720
all the people you've infected.

50
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:52,140
Your little trip must
have shown you the truth.

51
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,150
It would be better for everyone

52
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:59,320
if you were just gone.

53
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:05,820
'Scuse.

54
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:08,870
Get zapped.

55
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:11,870
My crystal.

56
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,170
Get eggy. Whoo!

57
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,170
Hand it over.

58
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:20,090
Za'Baby. Scarab,
all I was doing

59
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:22,260
was playing games on my work PC,

60
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,340
and you put me in
a flippin' egg?

61
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,680
Keep laying. Cluck, cluck!

62
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,260
Get out of my way.

63
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,640
Oh-ho-ho! Well, if it isn't

64
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,440
Mr. Entomb His Coworker

65
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,520
Because She Was Stealing
Office Supplies.

66
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,520
Scarab, you dweeb.

67
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:44,030
This is for the egg.

68
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:47,280
Enough, you cosmic delinquents.

69
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:56,370
Hello. I'm Perry, the
living island of insight,

70
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:59,960
may you direct me to
the nearest ocean?

71
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,050
Or inland sea?

72
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,010
Terry.

73
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,730
We're in luck.

74
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,700
These rockets have a
pre-programmed route

75
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,700
to the cosmic gate.

76
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:33,580
Oh, no, but the Moon Demon
King is so far ahead,

77
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,790
we'll never catch up.

78
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,250
Up-up-up. Now that we
have the destination,

79
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,250
I've figured out a shortcut.

80
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:42,340
Oh, Casper, I should have known.

81
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,600
Get up, Fi.

82
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,060
Ugh.

83
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,940
Crys-tal.

84
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,440
Oye. Huh?

85
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,980
Ants.

86
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,990
Hey.

87
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:10,160
Slick.

88
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,000
If I can't extract
this place whole...

89
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,290
I'll rip it out piece by piece.

90
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,130
Tree.

91
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,810
Our post office.

92
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:36,180
That was our oldest building.

93
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:39,560
Back up, everybody.
I've seen movies.

94
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:50,450
Ooh, I think I
stretched too big.

95
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:51,990
Go, Cake!

96
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:54,030
Love you, Fi.

97
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,960
"The Cosmic Gate."

98
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,880
Well, this is it.

99
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:10,300
"Casper and Nova arrive
at the cosmic gate.

100
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,930
On the other side
lies the magic crown."

101
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,350
Yes.

102
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:18,600
But the gate's closing.

103
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,890
Uh...

104
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,440
Nova.

105
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,600
Wait.

106
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,520
We can't both make it.

107
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,820
But you can climb
through, Casper.

108
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:31,150
Go. Aw, geez.

109
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,200
"Casper reaches
into his cloak."

110
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,570
What do we do?

111
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:37,370
"Fire once, Nova will hold
the gate open long enough

112
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,370
for Casper to grab the crown,

113
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:41,210
but she'll be crushed.

114
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:43,330
Or Casper drinks a potion

115
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,920
that'll give him the
strength to force the gate,

116
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,840
but it will also cause him
to forget Nova forever."

117
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,220
Forever?

118
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,590
Yeah, these options
are real downers.

119
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,760
But, hey, the
crown's right there.

120
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:00,810
Beth, I don't want either
of those things to happen.

121
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,560
I like Nova.

122
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,850
There should be more choices.

123
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,360
Well, maybe there would be

124
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,440
if you hadn't picked
Casper's options every time.

125
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:13,150
What? I did? Uh, that's...

126
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,570
That doesn't sound right.

127
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,370
There was the time I... Hmm.

128
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:20,830
If we had gone on
Nova's tablet quest

129
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:23,790
or ordered the baos that Nova
wanted from the food wizard,

130
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:27,040
it could have led down a
completely different path.

131
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:31,920
But they were both after
the same thing, the crown.

132
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,340
Weren't they?

133
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:36,180
I guess you're a kid. You
don't get this stuff yet.

134
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:40,180
Nova was basically
obsessed with Casper.

135
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,100
Wait. I thought...

136
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,850
I thought they were in love.

137
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,860
They were, but it wasn't
exactly on equal footing.

138
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,730
I guess that's not
Casper's fault per se.

139
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:55,450
No, but he could have
been more thoughtful.

140
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:58,320
He could've noticed
that she was sacrificing

141
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:02,040
over and over.

142
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,620
He could've...

143
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,250
Nyah! Get it off me!

144
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,260
Hey, Beth, I was a
prisoner in my own head.

145
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,600
Roar!

146
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:31,020
Oh, my God. Cake's so cool.

147
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:33,650
Yeah, but I'm worried she's
overextending herself.

148
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,910
Yay.

149
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,370
My breadbasket.

150
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:50,380
Oh, no, Cake.

151
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,590
Cake. Cake.

152
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:55,380
Ugh. Sorry, Fionna.

153
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,880
You did great.

154
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:00,300
You're in
eight, right?

155
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:09,350
Oh, no, Ellis P. Was in there.

156
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,440
What?

157
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,730
I'm not magic. I
don't have a sword.

158
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,860
I can't do anything.

159
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,530
Hm.

160
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,750
Uh, you more of a
butter-tart guy?

161
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,210
I'll stop him...

162
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:33,880
with music.

163
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,710
Your song about tumbleweeds?

164
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:40,010
No, a new, heartfelt song
inspired by our love.

165
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,400
I think it's wor...

166
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:01,870
No.

167
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,790
Please.

168
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,160
I take it back.

169
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,880
I want this world!

170
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:21,220
Oh, Betty.

171
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:24,100
Is that what it was like?

172
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:28,770
I stood by and allowed you
to sacrifice yourself for me.

173
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:32,810
Even though part of me
should've known better.

174
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,190
Like that day at the bus stop.

175
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,730
Betty!

176
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,900
Betty!

177
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:38,940
Betty!

178
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,110
Petrikov.

179
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:42,320
I could've made the
effort to support you,

180
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,620
the way you always supported me.

181
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,370
Maybe I never would
have found the crown.

182
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:50,960
I, uh... I-I found your note.

183
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,120
Yeah?

184
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,420
Who knows what life
would have been like.

185
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,880
You should be more
careful with...

186
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,300
You know what?

187
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,970
The Enchiridion can wait.

188
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:08,640
Let's go check out
some petroglyphs.

189
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,480
Really? You'd do that for me?

190
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,600
Oh, Petrikov.

191
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:22,320
But wait.

192
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,200
This isn't how it happened.

193
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,540
No, we made our choices.

194
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,870
We could've made better ones,

195
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:33,290
but I don't have any regrets.

196
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,300
You were a wonderful experience.

197
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,130
You were...

198
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:44,930
everything.

199
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:50,020
Where are you going?!

200
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:09,700
Was that conversation
all in my head?

201
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,620
I think...

202
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,040
I only offered to
become Ice King

203
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,800
because I felt my
life didn't matter.

204
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,380
But I'm really no
less worthy of life

205
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,880
than Fionna or Cake.

206
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:29,800
Huh?

207
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,690
Simon. Fionna.

208
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:41,020
What happened? Are you okay?

209
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,190
I'm okay.

210
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:45,070
I accidentally got
the ritual to work.

211
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,990
I'm with GOLBetty.

212
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:49,570
Hey, that's great.
Did you talk?

213
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,830
Aah! Mostly I talked.

214
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:54,080
Listen, the Scarab is here...

215
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,500
Oh, no. Hang on.

216
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,790
I'll put on the crown.

217
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:59,080
Maybe you can fight
better with magic.

218
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,170
Don't.

219
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,710
Don't change anything.

220
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,380
This is the world we
want to fight for.

221
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,680
The Scarab is
kinda invincible...

222
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,390
Fionna, let's go.

223
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,600
But we won't give up.

224
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,560
But, Fionna, what if...

225
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,100
If we die, we'll die together.

226
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,770
As ourselves.

227
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:21,730
It's not fair that your
world is in my stupid head.

228
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:23,110
Hey, if it wasn't,

229
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:26,190
we wouldn't have met
the Simon Petrikov.

230
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,070
Don't worry, Simon.

231
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,530
What happened
to my bus? I gotta go.

232
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,700
Fionna...

233
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,040
I swear it was
right here. Aah!

234
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:54,220
I didn't ask for
this responsibility.

235
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,640
It's too much.

236
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,520
GOLBetty.

237
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,270
It's too mu...

238
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,320
Fionna-world?

239
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,950
Fionna's world.

240
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,210
Come on, Cake. Please get up.

241
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,880
Just give me five minutes.

242
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,720
I'm not sure we
have five minutes.

243
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:34,720
Simon, please don't
make it harder.

244
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,180
I have something for you.

245
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,980
Fionna.

246
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:43,020
What are you talking about?

247
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:49,530
Is that...? Yes.

248
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:52,610
Your world.

249
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,990
What do I do with...
You'll do fine.

250
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:00,160
That's our world?

251
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,330
So now what?

252
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:02,920
Do we eat it?

253
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,090
Our universe was inside one
dude for years and years.

254
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:12,050
But it wouldn't be right
for us to have it, either.

255
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:14,090
Of course not.

256
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,220
Hmm.

257
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,430
Pbht!

258
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,240
I wish...

259
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,160
Que linda. Aah!

260
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,170
I don't totally understand
what's happening.

261
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:49,920
Come to mama.

262
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,150
Thank you.

263
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,760
Whoa.

264
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,090
Uh...

265
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:36,760
Oh, no.

266
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,260
Uh...

267
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,640
One of these has to lead to Ooo.

268
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:52,480
Come on. Come on.

269
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:58,450
Ugh, gonna have to ice
these knucks for a week.

270
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:00,830
Okay, let's see.

271
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:03,370
Is Fionna-world still there?

272
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,290
Wait, what?

273
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,340
They're legit now?

274
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,300
How did that happen?

275
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:15,550
Aah!

276
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:18,180
It's gonna hurt.

277
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,180
Oh, glob.

278
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,930
Huh?

279
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:36,610
Ha! You can't repo an
authorized universe.

280
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,200
No. No. Come on.

281
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:48,830
This isn't possible.

282
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:55,050
Unless... this universe
has been canonized.

283
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:59,050
Boss?

284
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:02,720
Okay, but... ugh,
it's not fair.

285
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,180
I did everything right.

286
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,890
Yay! We won!

287
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,060
Come on, bring it in.

288
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,400
No, listen. Listen.

289
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,730
I... Boss, please.

290
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:17,400
Fine.

291
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,530
Hey, Mr. Scarab?

292
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:22,160
No hard feelings, okay?

293
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:29,210
No hard feelings?

294
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:36,630
I'm gonna tear down
Prismo's precious sandcastle

295
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:39,470
with my bare hands!

296
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:49,230
Oh, crap. That
guy's just not cool.

297
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:52,810
There's gotta be
something I can do.

298
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,800
Hey, Scrabby, stop
wrecking my town

299
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,090
just 'cause you got
beef with Prismo.

300
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:22,880
If anything, you
should be mad at us.

301
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,600
Ma'am.

302
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:34,020
Alright, baby. Yay, baby!

303
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:37,150
Hey. Some pink laser
came to visit us all.

304
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:39,110
Said you needed back-up.

305
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:41,490
Aw, thanks, y'all.

306
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:42,740
Hey, friend.

307
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:46,530
Sorry I bailed on you before.

308
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,280
Never again.

309
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,410
Aah! Don't hurt me!

310
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,330
- Aah!
- Aah!

311
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,500
Squirrel, throw the strawbs.

312
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,750
Oh. Right.

313
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,670
Huh? Eat 'em.

314
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,630
I meant like one or two.

315
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,720
Oh, my God!

316
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,140
Cake! What?

317
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:13,390
This is my top fantasy.

318
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:17,520
Lemme try this again.

319
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,190
Yaaa!

320
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:24,570
Blegh.

321
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,740
Hey, Cake, little help?

322
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,530
Time to get hammered!

323
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,700
Oh, yeah.

324
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,100
Ptwuh.

325
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:53,220
You think you've
won something? Ha

326
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:56,060
You were living in
this fake bubble

327
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,980
where nothing happens.

328
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:02,320
But now you get all
the bad stuff, too.

329
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,360
Your world to screw up.

330
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,990
That just sounds like
we're real to me.

331
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,330
Nyeh, nyeh.

332
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,700
Egg you.

333
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,870
Jay.

334
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,880
Heads up!

335
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:23,050
Guess what. I'm a copycat.

336
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,090
Aah!

337
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,850
It's over.

338
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,770
What do we do now?

339
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,110
Hmm.

340
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:45,440
Oh, I got you something to eat.

341
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,700
No more mice.

342
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,110
Mnh-mnh.

343
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,620
Eyyy.

344
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,960
Fionna. Would it be okay
if we just stayed here?

345
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,250
Oh, angels, stay forever.

346
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:03,210
Ugh, yes. Thank you.

347
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:05,590
You have functioning toilets.

348
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:06,970
Yeah.

349
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,380
Yeah, we do.

All in all, I think
Orbo let you off easy.

367
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:25,960
It probably helped that I
put in a good word for you.

368
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:30,420
Maybe you can even grant a
wish in a couple hundred years.

369
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,340
But you gotta pay
your dues first.

370
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:36,050
Only people who never
pay their dues say that.

371
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:39,020
Hey, Scarab, why
don't you take five?

372
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:42,560
I'll show you how to use my
character-creation program.

373
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:47,730
So I like to start
with an overall theme.

374
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,820
How about true heroes?

375
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,110
No.

376
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:55,030
Put in "dark medieval
mystery drama."

377
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,660
Wow, okay.

378
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:03,370
I'm feeling like this whole
experience with Fionna and Cake

379
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:07,170
helped me realize that
my life is worthwhile.

380
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:09,460
I'm worried I'll forget that.

381
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:13,170
This will be a cycle of
learning and forgetting

382
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:16,220
and relearning and
forgetting again.

383
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,810
This
is juicy stuff.

384
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:21,980
Keep going.

385
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:24,560
I'm thinking of moving.

386
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:34,740
Ah, just a normal world.
