1
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,551
I'm telling you, something's missing.

2
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,519
But Tim, when it comes to deserts, we've got
everything under the sun.

3
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,678
Sorry, DA, it just doesn't say "desert" yet.

4
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:34,589
Are you kidding? It screams "desert." We've
got sand. We've got gravel.

5
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,478
We've got desert plants like cacti, creosote
bushes, ocotillo.

6
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,239
We've got the desert's harsh conditions.

7
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,476
Hot, blazing sun

8
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,835
Dry, blinding dust storms.

9
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,268
Tim's right. There is something missing!

10
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,439
As I always say, Arnold, it never hurts to be
prepared.

11
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,439
That's funny, Ms. Frizzle, that's exactly what l
was thinking.

12
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,593
I know! I know! Desert animals! That's
what's missing!

13
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,998
Ms. Frizzle, our diorama will never be
complete without desert animals!

14
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,154
Dynamic deduction, Phoebe!

15
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,158
These should do for now.

16
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,754
Now? It's later I'm worried about.

17
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,316
Thank you, Ms. Frizzle. Here you go, little
guy....

18
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,589
According to my research, that's a kangaroo
rat. And that's a gila monster.

19
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,916
Isn't it cute?!

20
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,878
Only Phoebe would think a Gila monster is
cute.

21
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:50,955
And there's more...Tortoise...beetle...
scorpion...jackrabbit...roadrunner...

22
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,473
Hey, Liz, what's up with you?

23
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,988
And you know what this is? A baby coyote!

24
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,439
Phoebe, are you sure all these animals live in
the desert?

25
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,435
Think about it. The desert is really hot.

26
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,832
The sun beats down all day long. Beat. Beat.
Beat.

27
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:19,318
And there's nowhere for the animals to go to
escape the heat...heat... heat!

28
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,312
But...

29
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,313
Not only is it hot, but there's hardly any food in
the desert!

30
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,030
So any animal that shows its face...gets
EATEN by a bigger one!

31
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,436
STOP!

32
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,511
And that's not all.

33
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,436
It isn't?

34
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,957
The worst part? There's almost NO WATER
in the desert.

35
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,752
No water?

36
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,998
Uh-uh. No shelter. No food. No water.

37
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,313
In no time at all, all your cute little animals are
buzzard bait.

38
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:56,996
SCARClTY is the name of the game, Pheebs.
Scar-ci-ty.

39
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,795
He's right, Phoebe. There's not much food,
water, or shelter in the desert.

40
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,677
We've got to DO something!

41
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,510
Yeah!

42
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,431
What can we do? What can we do?

43
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,919
What can WE do?

44
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,033
Well, at my old school, we'd take a stand!
Form a committee!!

45
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,559
Go on a field trip!?

46
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,554
Arnold? Are you serious?

47
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,076
He's right! SADS to the rescue!

48
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,428
SADS?

49
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,835
Students Against Desert Scarcity!

50
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,513
To the Desert!

51
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,316
Ms. Frizzle? Yes Arnold?

52
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:32,918
For once, I'm prepared.... Regulation Desert
gear...

53
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,709
As outlined in Chapter 7 of my new Field Trip
Survival Guide....

54
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,713
Ms. Frizzle, do your worst!

55
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,518
I'll do my best, Arnold!

56
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,358
Well, are you guys coming,

57
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,355
or do I have to save these desert animals all
by myself? To the bus!

58
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,271
Follow that Phoebe!

59
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,438
Hey Arnold, so what d'you have in that
knapsack anyway.

60
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,951
A little sunblock, snake bite kit, a few dozen
Malloblasters...

61
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,877
What?! No football!?

62
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,639
Carlos, we are NOT going to the desert to
have FUN!

63
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,192
We're not? The desert is full of surprises,
Phoebe.

64
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,875
And this bus is so slow! Can't we go any
faster, Ms Frizzle?

65
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,999
Every second we waste means those poor
little animals are out there suffering.

66
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,192
That's one way of looking at it, Phoebe! Okay
bus! Do your stuff!

67
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,871
All right!

68
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,197
Way to go!!

69
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,549
Are we there yet?

70
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,154
Chill, Phoebe. We only just took off.

71
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:58,713
We're flying over mountains. Didn't you say
"Students Against DESERT Scarcity"?

72
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,152
Yeah, and mountains have PLENTY of shelter,
food and water.

73
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,675
Ms. Frizzle! We must be going the wrong
way!

74
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:09,880
Wrong way? Why, Phoebe. If it weren't for
the mountains, there wouldn't be a desert.

75
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,878
What do mountains have to do with the
desert?

76
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,434
Haven't you guys ever heard of a rain shadow?

77
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,675
No...

78
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,357
Some deserts are made by what's called the
rain shadow effect.

79
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,273
When warm moist air rises over the
mountains...

80
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,272
its water vapor condenses into rain or snow.

81
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,430
The mountains catch all the moisture,

82
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,433
so the air reaching the other side is dry as a
desert.

83
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,995
Look out below!!

84
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,590
It's not fair! Why should the mountains get all
the water!

85
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,748
If you keep asking questions, Phoebe. You'll
find an answer!

86
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,310
Oh, and there's the perfect parking spot! Hold
on tight!

87
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,991
Field Trip Tip Number 63, "ln the event of a
rapid loss of altitude

88
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,550
you may want to put on a parachute." Liz, my
parachute.

89
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,759
That's not a paraCHUTE, that's a
pair-a-SHOES!

90
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,280
Look at this place!

91
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:30,715
Whew! The Thermoprobe reads 1 07 degrees
Fahrenheit! That's HOT!

92
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,714
How can anything live here?

93
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:40,030
Is it just me? Or does this look like the "Final"
field trip.

94
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,396
Come along, class. We're here to experience
the desert!

95
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,634
Take chances! Make mistakes! Get dusty!

96
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,429
Field Trip Tip Number 87...Not a problem!

97
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,559
Come on, you guys. Students Against Desert
Scarcity, remember?

98
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,993
We've got work to do!

99
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,358
Desert Scarcity? What about Dessert
Scarcity? I'm hungry!

100
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,749
Hey, Arnold, where are those Malloblasters?

101
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,469
I'm afraid they've melted.

102
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,516
How can you even think about eating

103
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,512
when all these poor little animals are suffering
from hunger?!

104
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,552
The only poor little animals I see...are US!

105
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,993
There's one!

106
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,791
Why that's a collared lizard!

107
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,910
And that's a funny-looking bird!

108
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:33,072
That, Keesha, is a fine example of a hungry
roadrunner chasing a delicious lizard to eat!

109
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,635
Come on! We have to protect that lizard!

110
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,033
At my old school, lizards never ran on their
hind legs!

111
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,836
Quick, everyone, back in the bus!

112
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,229
Phoebe. What are we doing??

113
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,437
How would you like to be a lizard being
chased by a hungry roadrunner?

114
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,192
A situation worth exploration, Phoebe!

115
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,716
Wow, cool, we're shrinking

116
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:12,554
As I always say...'when the going gets hungry,
the hungry get going.'

117
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,274
Bad oh bad oh bad bad bad.

118
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,278
And getting worse! It's gaining on us!

119
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,397
I hate field trips where we get eaten!

120
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,914
Any minute now, we're going to know what it
feels like to be EATEN!

121
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:42,032
Field Trip Tip Number 107:. To avoid being
eaten become inedible.

122
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,878
WHAT's THAT MEAN?!!

123
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,430
Class? Do I hear a suggestion to avoid
digestion?

124
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,710
According to my research, Arnold,

125
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,712
it means we ought to become something that's
not very appetizing.

126
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:59,391
On the button, DA! One inedible horned lizard
coming up!

127
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,628
Phew! Close one!

128
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:15,469
Well, first-hand experience tells us
roadrunners don't like lizards with spikes!

129
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,470
Would you?

130
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,115
So, the little animals here have special ways
to avoid getting eaten

131
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,395
Iike running fast or being prickly...

132
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,551
Phoebe, that's right!

133
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,314
Which means they don't need your help,
Pheebs.

134
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,109
Are you sure about that? Life is tough in the
desert.

135
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,749
Don't we know it! It's too hot to chase after
animals!

136
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,913
Or to be chased! Phew! I'm burning up!

137
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,676
Exactly! And somewhere out there is a poor
little animal which is burning up, too!

138
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,479
Now come on, we've got to find it and help it!

139
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,558
Stop the bus, please.

140
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,035
Everybody out!

141
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,872
Not again.

142
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,230
Single file, class.

143
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,359
I'm hot!

144
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,751
I'm tired!

145
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,553
I'm hungry!

146
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,558
I'm prepared.

147
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,795
Phoebe, we've been looking and looking...and
we haven't found anymore animals.

148
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,314
None, Phoebe. And I'm burning up!

149
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,429
Me too!

150
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:30,839
You're hot! What about that poor little
jackrabbit?!

151
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:36,592
See? It's sitting there with the sun beating
down on its head! And it's wearing a fur coat.

152
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,750
Field Trip Tip Number 1 58

153
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,958
when the sun is beating down on your head,
put on a hat. Got that covered.

154
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,109
Thanks, Arnold!

155
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,428
Hey!!

156
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,515
Here little jack rabbit. This will keep you from
getting too hot...a nice hat to shade your--

157
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,749
Phoebe

158
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,436
Arnold! Now how will that jackrabbit keep
cool?

159
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,589
Well...

160
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,796
EAR-conditioning, Phoebe!

161
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,678
EAR-conditioning! Good one, Ms Frizzle!

162
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,352
Thanks, Carlos

163
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,318
Carlos! How can you joke at a time like this?

164
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,915
According to my research, it's not a joke,
Phoebe!

165
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:15,119
You know how a car radiator cools off hot
water from the engine...

166
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,636
some desert animals have big ears which do
the same thing.

167
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:23,038
When their warm blood moves through their
big ears, it gets cooled off in the same way!

168
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,348
Stay cool.

169
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,191
Come on, Pheebs, just admit it.

170
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,352
The lizards don't need your help and neither
do the jackrabbits.

171
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:38,759
Okay. So the jackrabbit has a way to keep
itself cool. But what about that!

172
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:45,510
That is a desert tortoise! You don't usually see
them out in the heat like this.

173
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:50,839
See? An animal in need! Come on! We've
got to help it!

174
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,598
We do?

175
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,591
Carlos, don't be so selfish

176
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,752
How would you like to be a tortoise roasting in
the hot desert sun?

177
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,871
I wish you hadn't said that...

178
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,268
As I always say, there's more than one way to
beat the heat!

179
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,113
Oh, no!

180
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,358
So THlS is what it's like to be a desert
tortoise!

181
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,953
Where are we?

182
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,032
In a tortoise burrow. An underground shelter.

183
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,595
It's A LOT cooler down here.

184
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,792
Ah! Good observation, Keesha!

185
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,028
Yes! Another animal that can keep cool
without your help, Pheebolino!

186
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,799
But Carlos! I just thought of something!

187
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,476
Maybe the reason we didn't see any animals is
because they all burned up before we got here!

188
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,519
I knew it! We're too late!

189
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,838
What's happening?

190
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,876
Class, the bus is now on automatic turtle!

191
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,591
We're being pushed by another desert
tortoise!

192
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,317
Are we still in the desert?

193
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,351
Wow, what happened?

194
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,069
The sun went down and the desert has totally
changed!

195
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:36,115
Oh Carlos look! How sweet, eleven, twelve,
thirteen, fourteen...

196
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,279
Hey! We weren't too late! The reason we
didn't see any animals is

197
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,272
because they were just waiting for the sun to
go down!

198
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,832
50 degrees Fahrenheit! You don't have any
sweaters in that knapsack, do you Arnold?

199
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,993
Once the sun goes down, the air cools off.

200
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,469
Field Trip Tip Number 257:.

201
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:59,758
To beat the heat do like most desert
animals...come out only at night.

202
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:05,790
There you have it, Phoebe. Another way
desert animals help themselves!

203
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:09,395
It's okay, Phoebe. There's nothing wrong with
being wrong.

204
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:13,838
As I always say, 'Make mistakes. Make
mistakes. Make mistakes.'

205
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,832
It's the best way to learn something.

206
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:22,193
But, let's face it - Students Against Desert
Scarcity is a bust.

207
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,115
Okay, Carlos. Okay. You don't have to rub it
in

208
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,196
I might have made a mistake about that lizard.

209
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,840
And I might have made a mistake about the
jack rabbit.

210
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,196
And I even might have made a mistake about
the tortoise.

211
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,191
But there's one thing I know I'm not wrong
about...

212
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,834
How much you wish you'd stayed home today?

213
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,713
No. How much everything here on the desert
needs water!!

214
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,199
You're telling me!

215
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,276
Thanks, Ralphie.

216
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,315
Phoebe!

217
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,790
Well, if no one's going to help me give water
to all these poor little animals..

218
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,632
I'll just do it MYSELF!

219
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,676
Phoebe! Where are you going?

220
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,553
I said I was going to give these poor animals
water, and I'm going to...

221
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:01,792
Phoebe, I know this may sound crazy, but hear
me out.

222
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,359
Okay, Carlos - I'm listening.

223
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,637
These animals didn't need your protection
from being eaten

224
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,711
or from burning up in the sun, right?

225
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,630
Right...

226
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,478
They can cope. Right?

227
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,515
Right...

228
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:16,070
Well, maybe they don't need your water,
either.

229
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,958
Carlos, HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT??

230
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,349
You KNOW there's no water in the desert.

231
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,352
You said so yourself. Rain
shadow...remember?

232
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,837
But look at them. They couldn't live without
water.

233
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,549
And they are definitely alive. They must get it
somehow.

234
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:35,519
Okay, then, if you're so smart, tell me HOW!

235
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:41,078
Come on, Carlos, take chances, get messy,
make MlSTAKES.

236
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,958
I...I don't know.

237
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:48,551
Exactly. Maybe people like me come out here
and give the animals water.

238
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,072
Maybe people like me keep these animals
alive.

239
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,714
Hey, at least save the water for the animals...

240
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,353
What are you talking about?

241
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,072
Didn't you just splash me?

242
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,116
Is that... rain??

243
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,595
Everyone back on the bus!

244
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,869
Rain?

245
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,075
In the desert?

246
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,078
It doesn't rain here very often class, but...

247
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:23,194
as I always say, not very often is a long way
from never!

248
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,750
And the desert is a long way from needing my
water...

249
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,595
And we're a long way from the bus. Come on,
Phoebe!

250
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:36,073
Doesn't it feel GREAT? NOW we're talking
WATER.

251
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:46,674
It's amazing. We went from absolutely no
water to....FLOOOD!

252
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,593
Good morning, class! Everything's right as
rain!

253
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,792
Where are we?

254
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,393
What happened to the desert?

255
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,989
Is this a dream?

256
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:22,035
No, Phoebe, it's the desert after a rainstorm.

257
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,749
Everything's changed. There's so much
activity.

258
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,595
What happened to all the scarcity? Look at all
these plants and animals.

259
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,915
Desert life never ceases to amaze me!

260
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,034
Do you see what I see? Flower power!

261
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,351
It's as if they were waiting for enough water to
bloom.

262
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,548
There are shrimp in this puddle!

263
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,875
Shrimp? In the desert??

264
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,633
Ah huh and pigs too, look!

265
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:56,396
Actually that's a peccary, a desert relative of
pigs.

266
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,471
And this cactus is full of water!

267
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:04,676
According to my observations, this piece of
cactus is juicy on the inside

268
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,035
and waxy on the outside.

269
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,716
Hey...maybe that waxy stuff keeps the water in.

270
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:15,152
As I always say, when it pours, the desert
stores.

271
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,311
You know, Phoebe. You were right.

272
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,958
The desert does need water.

273
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,476
And the animals need protection from being
eaten and from the heat.

274
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,154
Yeah but Carlos, you were right too.

275
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,592
They don't need us to help them. They're
already equipped to live here.

276
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,631
That's right, Phoebe.

277
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:36,350
Everything that lives here has adaptations to
help cope with life in the desert.

278
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,075
Come along, class! Back to the bus.

279
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:43,597
You mean soaking up water as quickly as
possible is an adaptation?

280
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,269
Absolutely correct!

281
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,635
And having spikes is an adaptation...

282
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,671
...that helps keep you off the menu.

283
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,031
And burrowing under the sand

284
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,874
and having big ears is an adaptation for
beating the heat.

285
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,515
Yes! All the things that live here have
adaptations for survival.

286
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,989
It makes so much sense, doesn't it?

287
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,429
Field Trip Tip Number 999. For those without
desert adaptations

288
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,353
always travel with a teacher with frizzy
red-hair.

289
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,599
Well, I have to say, except for the part where
we almost got eaten...

290
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,632
...and the part where we almost burned up in
the sun...

291
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,029
and the part where we almost drowned in a
flood...

292
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,237
...my field trip manual was REALLY helpful.

293
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,640
So glad you enjoyed it, Arnold.

294
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,191
Well, now that I know that all these plants

295
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,192
and animals have adaptations to help them
cope with living in the desert,

296
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,595
that gives me some time to save something
else.

297
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,315
Phoebe, I don't think this is a...

298
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,834
I tell you, we've got to DO something!

299
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,309
Phoebe! We just DlD something!

300
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,436
A whole bunch of somethings!

301
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:10,953
But this time it really is an animal in need.
We'll call ourselves SASH!

302
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,359
SASH?

303
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,398
Students Assisting Sleepy Heads!

304
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,949
CARLOS!!

305
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:24,031
He obviously has no adaptations to cope with
desert field trips!

306
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,870
According to my research, Phoebe,
hibernation lS an adaptation!

307
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:38,031
As I always say, if you can't take the heat, get
out of the desert!

308
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,148
Is it the magic school bus?

309
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:51,518
Is it the magic school bus?

310
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,715
Is it the magic school bus?

311
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,790
Is it the magic school bus?

312
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,353
Is it the magic school bus?

313
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,399
stay tune with us and be a smart kid

314
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,190
Are you sure the Producer wanted this fake
cactus, Liz?

315
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,354
I better go...

316
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:21,351
Me? At my old school, kids NEVER answered
the phone. Hello...?

317
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,437
Is this the Magic School Bus?

318
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,396
Yes, but...

319
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,550
Good, because you see I'm starting up a new
group...

320
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,677
Save Our Kangaroo Rats...and I want Phoebe
to be president.

321
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,832
You do? I mean that's nice of you to say

322
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,480
but kangaroo rats don't need to be saved.

323
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,834
You mean, they have adaptations which make
it possible for them to live in the desert, too?

324
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:44,159
Right. For instance, they may never take a
drink in their entire lives.

325
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,750
They can get all the water they need from the
seeds and plants they eat.

326
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,670
Well, do they have an adaptation to help them
cope with the short nights?

327
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,318
Short nights?

328
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,313
Yeah, watching that show you'd think that night
time lasted about five seconds.

329
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,235
Oh, well, we were a little short on time...

330
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,076
Ah-ha!

331
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:06,512
But just a little! We wanted to show how
desert animals come out at night.

332
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,478
It's an adaptation, you know!

333
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,188
Okay, speaking of "adaptations,"

334
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,596
I don't know of ANY plant that grows from a
seed the instant it rains.

335
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,956
Look, when you have a lot of information to
cover in a half hour,

336
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:21,191
you don't have time to wait for seeds to grow
into plants!

337
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,119
But they do grow very quickly in the desert.

338
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,471
Did you want to see the desert in full bloom
after the rain or not?

339
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:31,314
Of course I did...And did you know that cactus
needles are really leaves?

340
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,192
Is that an adaptation?

341
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,511
Yes! Unlike leaves, needles don't lose any
water!

342
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,233
And you know what else? Not all deserts are
hot..

343
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,908
Even places that are very cold are called
deserts if they don't get enough rain.

344
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,993
Fascinating! Well, thanks for calling.

345
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:53,039
Wait! One more question! Do you actually
know Phoebe?

346
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,388
Yes. In fact--

347
00:23:54,480 --> 00:24:00,237
Could you do me a favor? Just tell her I think
she's the greatest. Goodbye!

348
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,954
Maybe I should answer the phone more
often...

349
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,835
THE END
