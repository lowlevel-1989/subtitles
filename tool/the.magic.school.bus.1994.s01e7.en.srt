1
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,701
I'm telling you, something's missing.

2
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,669
But Tim, when it comes to deserts, we've got
everything under the sun.

3
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,828
Sorry, DA, it just doesn't say "desert" yet.

4
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:38,739
Are you kidding? It screams "desert." We've
got sand. We've got gravel.

5
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:43,628
We've got desert plants like cacti, creosote
bushes, ocotillo.

6
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,389
We've got the desert's harsh conditions.

7
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,626
Hot, blazing sun

8
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,985
Dry, blinding dust storms.

9
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,418
Tim's right. There is something missing!

10
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:07,589
As I always say, Arnold, it never hurts to be
prepared.

11
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:11,589
That's funny, Ms. Frizzle, that's exactly what l
was thinking.

12
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:15,743
I know! I know! Desert animals! That's
what's missing!

13
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:20,148
Ms. Frizzle, our diorama will never be
complete without desert animals!

14
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:23,304
Dynamic deduction, Phoebe!

15
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,308
These should do for now.

16
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,904
Now? It's later I'm worried about.

17
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:34,466
Thank you, Ms. Frizzle. Here you go, little
guy....

18
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:40,739
According to my research, that's a kangaroo
rat. And that's a gila monster.

19
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,066
Isn't it cute?!

20
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:46,028
Only Phoebe would think a Gila monster is
cute.

21
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:55,105
And there's more...Tortoise...beetle...
scorpion...jackrabbit...roadrunner...

22
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:59,623
Hey, Liz, what's up with you?

23
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:04,138
And you know what this is? A baby coyote!

24
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:09,589
Phoebe, are you sure all these animals live in
the desert?

25
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:13,585
Think about it. The desert is really hot.

26
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:17,982
The sun beats down all day long. Beat. Beat.
Beat.

27
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:23,468
And there's nowhere for the animals to go to
escape the heat...heat... heat!

28
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:24,462
But...

29
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:28,463
Not only is it hot, but there's hardly any food in
the desert!

30
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:33,180
So any animal that shows its face...gets
EATEN by a bigger one!

31
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:35,586
STOP!

32
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:37,661
And that's not all.

33
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:38,586
It isn't?

34
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:43,107
The worst part? There's almost NO WATER
in the desert.

35
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,902
No water?

36
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:50,148
Uh-uh. No shelter. No food. No water.

37
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:55,463
In no time at all, all your cute little animals are
buzzard bait.

38
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:01,146
SCARClTY is the name of the game, Pheebs.
Scar-ci-ty.

39
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:04,945
He's right, Phoebe. There's not much food,
water, or shelter in the desert.

40
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,827
We've got to DO something!

41
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:07,660
Yeah!

42
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,581
What can we do? What can we do?

43
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,069
What can WE do?

44
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:15,183
Well, at my old school, we'd take a stand!
Form a committee!!

45
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,709
Go on a field trip!?

46
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:20,704
Arnold? Are you serious?

47
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:24,226
He's right! SADS to the rescue!

48
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,578
SADS?

49
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,985
Students Against Desert Scarcity!

50
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,663
To the Desert!

51
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,466
Ms. Frizzle? Yes Arnold?

52
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:37,068
For once, I'm prepared.... Regulation Desert
gear...

53
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:40,859
As outlined in Chapter 7 of my new Field Trip
Survival Guide....

54
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:43,863
Ms. Frizzle, do your worst!

55
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,668
I'll do my best, Arnold!

56
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,508
Well, are you guys coming,

57
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:52,505
or do I have to save these desert animals all
by myself? To the bus!

58
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,421
Follow that Phoebe!

59
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:05,588
Hey Arnold, so what d'you have in that
knapsack anyway.

60
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:10,101
A little sunblock, snake bite kit, a few dozen
Malloblasters...

61
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:12,027
What?! No football!?

62
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,789
Carlos, we are NOT going to the desert to
have FUN!

63
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:20,342
We're not? The desert is full of surprises,
Phoebe.

64
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:24,025
And this bus is so slow! Can't we go any
faster, Ms Frizzle?

65
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:28,149
Every second we waste means those poor
little animals are out there suffering.

66
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:34,342
That's one way of looking at it, Phoebe! Okay
bus! Do your stuff!

67
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,021
All right!

68
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:40,347
Way to go!!

69
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,699
Are we there yet?

70
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:57,304
Chill, Phoebe. We only just took off.

71
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:02,863
We're flying over mountains. Didn't you say
"Students Against DESERT Scarcity"?

72
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:06,302
Yeah, and mountains have PLENTY of shelter,
food and water.

73
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,825
Ms. Frizzle! We must be going the wrong
way!

74
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:14,030
Wrong way? Why, Phoebe. If it weren't for
the mountains, there wouldn't be a desert.

75
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:17,028
What do mountains have to do with the
desert?

76
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:19,584
Haven't you guys ever heard of a rain shadow?

77
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:20,825
No...

78
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:25,507
Some deserts are made by what's called the
rain shadow effect.

79
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:28,423
When warm moist air rises over the
mountains...

80
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:31,422
its water vapor condenses into rain or snow.

81
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,580
The mountains catch all the moisture,

82
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:37,583
so the air reaching the other side is dry as a
desert.

83
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,145
Look out below!!

84
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:44,740
It's not fair! Why should the mountains get all
the water!

85
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:48,898
If you keep asking questions, Phoebe. You'll
find an answer!

86
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:52,460
Oh, and there's the perfect parking spot! Hold
on tight!

87
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:03,141
Field Trip Tip Number 63, "ln the event of a
rapid loss of altitude

88
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:06,700
you may want to put on a parachute." Liz, my
parachute.

89
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:11,909
That's not a paraCHUTE, that's a
pair-a-SHOES!

90
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,430
Look at this place!

91
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:34,865
Whew! The Thermoprobe reads 1 07 degrees
Fahrenheit! That's HOT!

92
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,864
How can anything live here?

93
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:44,180
Is it just me? Or does this look like the "Final"
field trip.

94
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:47,546
Come along, class. We're here to experience
the desert!

95
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:51,784
Take chances! Make mistakes! Get dusty!

96
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:55,579
Field Trip Tip Number 87...Not a problem!

97
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:59,709
Come on, you guys. Students Against Desert
Scarcity, remember?

98
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,143
We've got work to do!

99
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:05,508
Desert Scarcity? What about Dessert
Scarcity? I'm hungry!

100
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:07,899
Hey, Arnold, where are those Malloblasters?

101
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,619
I'm afraid they've melted.

102
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:13,666
How can you even think about eating

103
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,662
when all these poor little animals are suffering
from hunger?!

104
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:19,702
The only poor little animals I see...are US!

105
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,143
There's one!

106
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,941
Why that's a collared lizard!

107
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,060
And that's a funny-looking bird!

108
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:37,222
That, Keesha, is a fine example of a hungry
roadrunner chasing a delicious lizard to eat!

109
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,785
Come on! We have to protect that lizard!

110
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:48,183
At my old school, lizards never ran on their
hind legs!

111
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,986
Quick, everyone, back in the bus!

112
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,379
Phoebe. What are we doing??

113
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:56,587
How would you like to be a lizard being
chased by a hungry roadrunner?

114
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:01,342
A situation worth exploration, Phoebe!

115
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:07,866
Wow, cool, we're shrinking

116
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:16,704
As I always say...'when the going gets hungry,
the hungry get going.'

117
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:19,424
Bad oh bad oh bad bad bad.

118
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:22,428
And getting worse! It's gaining on us!

119
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:25,547
I hate field trips where we get eaten!

120
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:41,064
Any minute now, we're going to know what it
feels like to be EATEN!

121
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:46,182
Field Trip Tip Number 107:. To avoid being
eaten become inedible.

122
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:48,028
WHAT's THAT MEAN?!!

123
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:51,580
Class? Do I hear a suggestion to avoid
digestion?

124
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,860
According to my research, Arnold,

125
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:56,862
it means we ought to become something that's
not very appetizing.

126
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:03,541
On the button, DA! One inedible horned lizard
coming up!

127
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,778
Phew! Close one!

128
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:19,619
Well, first-hand experience tells us
roadrunners don't like lizards with spikes!

129
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,620
Would you?

130
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:24,265
So, the little animals here have special ways
to avoid getting eaten

131
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,545
Iike running fast or being prickly...

132
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,701
Phoebe, that's right!

133
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:31,464
Which means they don't need your help,
Pheebs.

134
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:35,259
Are you sure about that? Life is tough in the
desert.

135
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:38,899
Don't we know it! It's too hot to chase after
animals!

136
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:43,063
Or to be chased! Phew! I'm burning up!

137
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:47,826
Exactly! And somewhere out there is a poor
little animal which is burning up, too!

138
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:50,629
Now come on, we've got to find it and help it!

139
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:53,708
Stop the bus, please.

140
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,185
Everybody out!

141
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:57,022
Not again.

142
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:59,380
Single file, class.

143
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,509
I'm hot!

144
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:13,901
I'm tired!

145
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,703
I'm hungry!

146
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:17,708
I'm prepared.

147
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:25,945
Phoebe, we've been looking and looking...and
we haven't found anymore animals.

148
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:28,464
None, Phoebe. And I'm burning up!

149
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:29,579
Me too!

150
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:34,989
You're hot! What about that poor little
jackrabbit?!

151
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:40,742
See? It's sitting there with the sun beating
down on its head! And it's wearing a fur coat.

152
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,900
Field Trip Tip Number 1 58

153
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:47,108
when the sun is beating down on your head,
put on a hat. Got that covered.

154
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,259
Thanks, Arnold!

155
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,578
Hey!!

156
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:54,665
Here little jack rabbit. This will keep you from
getting too hot...a nice hat to shade your--

157
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,899
Phoebe

158
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:59,586
Arnold! Now how will that jackrabbit keep
cool?

159
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:00,739
Well...

160
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,946
EAR-conditioning, Phoebe!

161
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:05,828
EAR-conditioning! Good one, Ms Frizzle!

162
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,502
Thanks, Carlos

163
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:10,468
Carlos! How can you joke at a time like this?

164
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:14,065
According to my research, it's not a joke,
Phoebe!

165
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:19,269
You know how a car radiator cools off hot
water from the engine...

166
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:22,786
some desert animals have big ears which do
the same thing.

167
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:27,188
When their warm blood moves through their
big ears, it gets cooled off in the same way!

168
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,498
Stay cool.

169
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:34,341
Come on, Pheebs, just admit it.

170
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:37,502
The lizards don't need your help and neither
do the jackrabbits.

171
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:42,909
Okay. So the jackrabbit has a way to keep
itself cool. But what about that!

172
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:49,660
That is a desert tortoise! You don't usually see
them out in the heat like this.

173
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:54,989
See? An animal in need! Come on! We've
got to help it!

174
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,748
We do?

175
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:58,741
Carlos, don't be so selfish

176
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:01,902
How would you like to be a tortoise roasting in
the hot desert sun?

177
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:04,021
I wish you hadn't said that...

178
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:08,418
As I always say, there's more than one way to
beat the heat!

179
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,263
Oh, no!

180
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:28,508
So THlS is what it's like to be a desert
tortoise!

181
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,103
Where are we?

182
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:33,182
In a tortoise burrow. An underground shelter.

183
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:35,745
It's A LOT cooler down here.

184
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:38,942
Ah! Good observation, Keesha!

185
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:44,178
Yes! Another animal that can keep cool
without your help, Pheebolino!

186
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:46,949
But Carlos! I just thought of something!

187
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:51,626
Maybe the reason we didn't see any animals is
because they all burned up before we got here!

188
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,669
I knew it! We're too late!

189
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,988
What's happening?

190
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:03,026
Class, the bus is now on automatic turtle!

191
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:09,741
We're being pushed by another desert
tortoise!

192
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,467
Are we still in the desert?

193
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:29,501
Wow, what happened?

194
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:33,219
The sun went down and the desert has totally
changed!

195
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:40,265
Oh Carlos look! How sweet, eleven, twelve,
thirteen, fourteen...

196
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:44,429
Hey! We weren't too late! The reason we
didn't see any animals is

197
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:47,422
because they were just waiting for the sun to
go down!

198
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:52,982
50 degrees Fahrenheit! You don't have any
sweaters in that knapsack, do you Arnold?

199
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:57,143
Once the sun goes down, the air cools off.

200
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,619
Field Trip Tip Number 257:.

201
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:03,908
To beat the heat do like most desert
animals...come out only at night.

202
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:09,940
There you have it, Phoebe. Another way
desert animals help themselves!

203
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:13,545
It's okay, Phoebe. There's nothing wrong with
being wrong.

204
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:17,988
As I always say, 'Make mistakes. Make
mistakes. Make mistakes.'

205
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:20,982
It's the best way to learn something.

206
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:26,343
But, let's face it - Students Against Desert
Scarcity is a bust.

207
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:30,265
Okay, Carlos. Okay. You don't have to rub it
in

208
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,346
I might have made a mistake about that lizard.

209
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:34,990
And I might have made a mistake about the
jack rabbit.

210
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:38,346
And I even might have made a mistake about
the tortoise.

211
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:40,341
But there's one thing I know I'm not wrong
about...

212
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:42,984
How much you wish you'd stayed home today?

213
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,863
No. How much everything here on the desert
needs water!!

214
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,349
You're telling me!

215
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,426
Thanks, Ralphie.

216
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,465
Phoebe!

217
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,940
Well, if no one's going to help me give water
to all these poor little animals..

218
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,782
I'll just do it MYSELF!

219
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,826
Phoebe! Where are you going?

220
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:01,703
I said I was going to give these poor animals
water, and I'm going to...

221
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:05,942
Phoebe, I know this may sound crazy, but hear
me out.

222
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,509
Okay, Carlos - I'm listening.

223
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:10,787
These animals didn't need your protection
from being eaten

224
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,861
or from burning up in the sun, right?

225
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:13,780
Right...

226
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,628
They can cope. Right?

227
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:16,665
Right...

228
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:20,220
Well, maybe they don't need your water,
either.

229
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:23,108
Carlos, HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT??

230
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,499
You KNOW there's no water in the desert.

231
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:28,502
You said so yourself. Rain
shadow...remember?

232
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:31,987
But look at them. They couldn't live without
water.

233
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:35,699
And they are definitely alive. They must get it
somehow.

234
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:39,669
Okay, then, if you're so smart, tell me HOW!

235
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:45,228
Come on, Carlos, take chances, get messy,
make MlSTAKES.

236
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:48,108
I...I don't know.

237
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:52,701
Exactly. Maybe people like me come out here
and give the animals water.

238
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:56,222
Maybe people like me keep these animals
alive.

239
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,864
Hey, at least save the water for the animals...

240
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,503
What are you talking about?

241
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,222
Didn't you just splash me?

242
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:06,266
Is that... rain??

243
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,745
Everyone back on the bus!

244
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:15,019
Rain?

245
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,225
In the desert?

246
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:19,228
It doesn't rain here very often class, but...

247
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:27,344
as I always say, not very often is a long way
from never!

248
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:30,900
And the desert is a long way from needing my
water...

249
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:34,745
And we're a long way from the bus. Come on,
Phoebe!

250
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:40,223
Doesn't it feel GREAT? NOW we're talking
WATER.

251
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:50,824
It's amazing. We went from absolutely no
water to....FLOOOD!

252
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:12,743
Good morning, class! Everything's right as
rain!

253
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,942
Where are we?

254
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,543
What happened to the desert?

255
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,139
Is this a dream?

256
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:26,185
No, Phoebe, it's the desert after a rainstorm.

257
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:29,899
Everything's changed. There's so much
activity.

258
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:34,745
What happened to all the scarcity? Look at all
these plants and animals.

259
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:39,065
Desert life never ceases to amaze me!

260
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:43,184
Do you see what I see? Flower power!

261
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:46,501
It's as if they were waiting for enough water to
bloom.

262
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:49,698
There are shrimp in this puddle!

263
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,025
Shrimp? In the desert??

264
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:55,783
Ah huh and pigs too, look!

265
00:18:56,030 --> 00:19:00,546
Actually that's a peccary, a desert relative of
pigs.

266
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:02,621
And this cactus is full of water!

267
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:08,826
According to my observations, this piece of
cactus is juicy on the inside

268
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:11,185
and waxy on the outside.

269
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:14,866
Hey...maybe that waxy stuff keeps the water in.

270
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:19,302
As I always say, when it pours, the desert
stores.

271
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,461
You know, Phoebe. You were right.

272
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:23,108
The desert does need water.

273
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:26,626
And the animals need protection from being
eaten and from the heat.

274
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:29,304
Yeah but Carlos, you were right too.

275
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:33,742
They don't need us to help them. They're
already equipped to live here.

276
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,781
That's right, Phoebe.

277
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:40,500
Everything that lives here has adaptations to
help cope with life in the desert.

278
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:43,225
Come along, class! Back to the bus.

279
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:47,747
You mean soaking up water as quickly as
possible is an adaptation?

280
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:50,419
Absolutely correct!

281
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:52,785
And having spikes is an adaptation...

282
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:54,821
...that helps keep you off the menu.

283
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:57,181
And burrowing under the sand

284
00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:01,024
and having big ears is an adaptation for
beating the heat.

285
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:05,665
Yes! All the things that live here have
adaptations for survival.

286
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,139
It makes so much sense, doesn't it?

287
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:15,579
Field Trip Tip Number 999. For those without
desert adaptations

288
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:18,503
always travel with a teacher with frizzy
red-hair.

289
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:37,749
Well, I have to say, except for the part where
we almost got eaten...

290
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:40,782
...and the part where we almost burned up in
the sun...

291
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:43,179
and the part where we almost drowned in a
flood...

292
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:46,387
...my field trip manual was REALLY helpful.

293
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:51,790
So glad you enjoyed it, Arnold.

294
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,341
Well, now that I know that all these plants

295
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:57,342
and animals have adaptations to help them
cope with living in the desert,

296
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:59,745
that gives me some time to save something
else.

297
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:02,465
Phoebe, I don't think this is a...

298
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:04,984
I tell you, we've got to DO something!

299
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:07,459
Phoebe! We just DlD something!

300
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:09,586
A whole bunch of somethings!

301
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:15,103
But this time it really is an animal in need.
We'll call ourselves SASH!

302
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,509
SASH?

303
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:19,548
Students Assisting Sleepy Heads!

304
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:22,099
CARLOS!!

305
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:28,181
He obviously has no adaptations to cope with
desert field trips!

306
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:33,020
According to my research, Phoebe,
hibernation lS an adaptation!

307
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:42,181
As I always say, if you can't take the heat, get
out of the desert!

308
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,298
Is it the magic school bus?

309
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:55,668
Is it the magic school bus?

310
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,865
Is it the magic school bus?

311
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:57,940
Is it the magic school bus?

312
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:59,503
Is it the magic school bus?

313
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:03,549
stay tune with us and be a smart kid

314
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:13,340
Are you sure the Producer wanted this fake
cactus, Liz?

315
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,504
I better go...

316
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:25,501
Me? At my old school, kids NEVER answered
the phone. Hello...?

317
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:27,587
Is this the Magic School Bus?

318
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:28,546
Yes, but...

319
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:30,700
Good, because you see I'm starting up a new
group...

320
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:33,827
Save Our Kangaroo Rats...and I want Phoebe
to be president.

321
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:36,982
You do? I mean that's nice of you to say

322
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:39,630
but kangaroo rats don't need to be saved.

323
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:43,984
You mean, they have adaptations which make
it possible for them to live in the desert, too?

324
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:48,309
Right. For instance, they may never take a
drink in their entire lives.

325
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:51,900
They can get all the water they need from the
seeds and plants they eat.

326
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:55,820
Well, do they have an adaptation to help them
cope with the short nights?

327
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:57,468
Short nights?

328
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:01,463
Yeah, watching that show you'd think that night
time lasted about five seconds.

329
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:05,385
Oh, well, we were a little short on time...

330
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,226
Ah-ha!

331
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:10,662
But just a little! We wanted to show how
desert animals come out at night.

332
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:12,628
It's an adaptation, you know!

333
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:15,338
Okay, speaking of "adaptations,"

334
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:18,746
I don't know of ANY plant that grows from a
seed the instant it rains.

335
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:22,106
Look, when you have a lot of information to
cover in a half hour,

336
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:25,341
you don't have time to wait for seeds to grow
into plants!

337
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:28,269
But they do grow very quickly in the desert.

338
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:31,621
Did you want to see the desert in full bloom
after the rain or not?

339
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:35,464
Of course I did...And did you know that cactus
needles are really leaves?

340
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,342
Is that an adaptation?

341
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:40,661
Yes! Unlike leaves, needles don't lose any
water!

342
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:44,383
And you know what else? Not all deserts are
hot..

343
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:50,058
Even places that are very cold are called
deserts if they don't get enough rain.

344
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:53,143
Fascinating! Well, thanks for calling.

345
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:57,189
Wait! One more question! Do you actually
know Phoebe?

346
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,538
Yes. In fact--

347
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:04,387
Could you do me a favor? Just tell her I think
she's the greatest. Goodbye!

348
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:07,104
Maybe I should answer the phone more
often...

349
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:09,985
THE END
