There are others that say
this is the beginning

4

It's not something to explain.

5

It's something
to be experienced.

00:08:35,993 --> 00:08:37,821
Yes, of course,
I'll be there. Of course.

162
00:08:39,127 --> 00:08:40,128
Okay.

163
00:08:40,824 --> 00:08:42,086
Well, then uh...

164
00:08:43,261 --> 00:08:44,654
Pick you up tomorrow.

165
00:08:45,307 --> 00:08:46,308
Bye, Greg.

166
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,052
See you later, Greg.

167
00:08:52,053 --> 00:08:56,536
<i>This generation, lost, aimless.</i>

168
00:08:57,841 --> 00:08:59,756
<i>Scripture tells us that
without a vision,</i>

169
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:03,717
people perish.

170
00:09:06,415 --> 00:09:07,808
In Hebrew, the word means...

171
00:09:09,244 --> 00:09:11,071
To cast off restraint.

172
00:09:11,072 --> 00:09:12,638
And isn't that what
we're witnessing today?

173
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:14,291
A generation without restraint.

174
00:09:14,292 --> 00:09:15,510
That's right.

175
00:09:15,511 --> 00:09:16,642
Cast off authority.

176
00:09:16,643 --> 00:09:17,991
Cast off tradition.

177
00:09:17,992 --> 00:09:20,342
Cast off morals.

178
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:28,698
Cast off god.

179
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,613
These...

180
00:09:33,964 --> 00:09:35,575
Are the headlines of our time.

181
00:09:39,404 --> 00:09:40,623
Is this our future?

182
00:09:42,407 --> 00:09:46,150
It seems as if we may be
at the end already.

183
00:09:47,761 --> 00:09:50,327
But as Jesus Christ,
our lord and savior, said

184
00:09:50,328 --> 00:09:53,767
"he who endures
till the end shall be saved."

185
00:09:54,289 --> 00:09:55,377
Amen.

186
00:10:01,818 --> 00:10:02,993
Let's pray.

187
00:10:07,476 --> 00:10:10,783

197
00:10:47,516 --> 00:10:48,517
Hey.

198
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,389
- Need a ride?
- Sure.

199
00:10:59,746 --> 00:11:00,746
Cool cape.

200
00:11:01,617 --> 00:11:03,793
Right on.
I painted it myself.

201
00:11:04,925 --> 00:11:05,925
Yeah.

202
00:11:07,754 --> 00:11:10,451
- I'm Lonnie.
- I'm janette.

203
00:11:10,452 --> 00:11:11,758
- Hey.
- Hey.

204
00:11:12,976 --> 00:11:14,498
So, where you headed?

205
00:11:14,499 --> 00:11:16,457
Coming down from San Francisco.

206
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:18,808
Spreading the good news
to whoever wants to hear it.

207
00:11:19,548 --> 00:11:21,331
How about you, janette?

208
00:11:21,332 --> 00:11:24,813
Do you know about the way,
the truth and the life?

209
00:11:24,814 --> 00:11:27,295
You've got to meet my dad.

210
00:11:27,861 --> 00:11:29,470
Far out.

211
00:11:29,471 --> 00:11:31,386
- Is he into hippies?
- Nope.

212
00:11:38,219 --> 00:11:41,438
"My god, my god,
why hast thou forsaken me?

213
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,703
"Why art thou so far
from helping me?"

214
00:11:48,838 --> 00:11:49,839
My stars.

215
00:11:51,145 --> 00:11:52,145
Hi, Chuck Smith.

216
00:11:52,146 --> 00:11:53,450
Who are you?

217
00:11:53,451 --> 00:11:54,930
How do you know my name?

218
00:11:54,931 --> 00:11:57,019
Oh, your daughter told me
when she picked me up.

219
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,978
You tell me right now
where my daughter is.

220
00:11:58,979 --> 00:12:00,675
- Janette!
- What?

221
00:12:00,676 --> 00:12:01,807
- Here.
Thanks.

222
00:12:01,808 --> 00:12:03,635
Who is this?
- It's Lonnie.

223
00:12:04,462 --> 00:12:05,898
Hi.

224
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:06,900
Hi, uh...

225
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,336
Would you mind just, uh,

226
00:12:09,337 --> 00:12:11,164
stepping outside
for a minute, mister...?

227
00:12:11,165 --> 00:12:13,167
Not at all. Frisbee.
Lonnie frisbee.

228
00:12:13,558 --> 00:12:14,907
Frisbee.

229
00:12:14,908 --> 00:12:15,995
Thank you.

230
00:12:15,996 --> 00:12:17,519
You got any sugar,
by any chance?

231
00:12:18,868 --> 00:12:20,173
What is going on?

232
00:12:20,174 --> 00:12:22,132
You said you wanted god
to send you a hippie.

233
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:27,223
I said that,
but I did not mean it.

234
00:12:27,224 --> 00:12:29,573
Dad, I am telling you,
there is something
about this guy.

235
00:12:29,574 --> 00:12:30,879
We talked all night.

236
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,098
He pretty much blew my mind.

237
00:12:32,099 --> 00:12:34,013
You spent the night with him?

238
00:12:34,014 --> 00:12:35,362
He could be an axe murderer.

239
00:12:35,363 --> 00:12:36,755
Anyone could be an axe murderer.

240
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,539
Look, just listen
for 10 minutes,

241
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:41,108
and if you think he's crazy,
I'll throw him out myself.

242
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,676
This house has a very good vibe.

243
00:12:53,424 --> 00:12:55,209
It's so great to meet you.

244
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:02,302
Oh, it smells amazing in here.

245
00:13:02,303 --> 00:13:04,434
- What are you making?
French toast.

246
00:13:04,435 --> 00:13:06,176
Oh, I love French toast.

247
00:13:09,614 --> 00:13:10,746
Ten minutes, cadets.

248
00:13:13,749 --> 00:13:14,794
Greg!

249
00:13:15,533 --> 00:13:16,664
Greg?

250
00:13:16,665 --> 00:13:17,839
What are you doing here?

251
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,710
We're here
to save you, man.
Come on!

252
00:13:19,711 --> 00:13:21,060
How'd you find me?

253
00:13:21,061 --> 00:13:22,757
We tried three schools.

254
00:13:22,758 --> 00:13:24,064
What is this?

255
00:13:24,151 --> 00:13:27,370
Uh, these are my friends.

256
00:13:27,371 --> 00:13:29,329
You walk outta
this classroom, son,

257
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:30,418
you won't be coming back.

258
00:13:33,377 --> 00:13:35,074
Sir, you can count on it.

259
00:13:35,075 --> 00:13:37,424
Thank you all.
Have a good
rest of your day.

260
00:13:37,425 --> 00:13:38,861

He's been freed!

272
00:14:15,767 --> 00:14:17,377
- Yeah!
- She's amazing!

273
00:14:17,378 --> 00:14:18,509
I know, right?

274
00:14:20,729 --> 00:14:22,905
We love you, Janis joplin!

275
00:14:25,168 --> 00:14:27,039
So, uh...

276
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,345
Tell me about yourself, Lonnie,

277
00:14:29,346 --> 00:14:30,521
and your uh...

278
00:14:32,088 --> 00:14:33,088
People.

279
00:14:34,699 --> 00:14:36,005
My people.

280
00:14:38,138 --> 00:14:39,443
I like the sound of that.

281
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:44,405
You know, it reminds me
of the words of Jesus.

282
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:50,540
"To what, then, can I compare
the people of this generation?

283
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:51,891
"What are they like?"

284
00:14:53,501 --> 00:14:56,851
I was up in San Francisco
for a long time.

285
00:14:56,852 --> 00:15:00,507
Living in haight-ashbury,
on the streets, all over.

286
00:15:00,508 --> 00:15:03,859
And we did everything,
and everyone.

287
00:15:05,513 --> 00:15:06,906
But that was the point.

288
00:15:07,428 --> 00:15:08,516
You see,

289
00:15:09,212 --> 00:15:10,387
the drugs,

290
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,129
it's a quest.

291
00:15:15,392 --> 00:15:16,393
For what?

292
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:18,830
For god.

293
00:15:20,658 --> 00:15:22,225
<i>How can you not see that?</i>

294
00:15:23,835 --> 00:15:28,927
There is an entire generation
right now searching for god.

295
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,321
<i>Everyone is accepted here.</i>

296
00:15:33,845 --> 00:15:36,718
<i>We love each other freely</i>

297
00:15:38,372 --> 00:15:40,026

<i>No lies.</i>

300
00:15:47,207 --> 00:15:49,686
<i>No masks.</i>

301
00:15:49,687 --> 00:15:53,690
<i>Just a relentless
pursuit of the truth</i>

302
00:15:53,691 --> 00:15:57,868
<i>by those who have expanded
their consciousness.</i>

303
00:15:57,869 --> 00:16:00,524
Man, we thought acid
was gonna save the world.

304
00:16:01,569 --> 00:16:02,612
- Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

305
00:16:02,613 --> 00:16:03,700
Thanks, mom.

306
00:16:03,701 --> 00:16:06,312
But that was a lie.

307
00:16:06,313 --> 00:16:09,316
As much of a lie as what
we were rebelling against.

308
00:16:10,491 --> 00:16:12,710
And what brought you
to that realization?

309
00:16:14,538 --> 00:16:17,410
I kept searching and searching,

310
00:16:17,411 --> 00:16:19,326
and I just finally
got to the end of it.

311
00:16:20,631 --> 00:16:21,893
And there was still a void.

312
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,983
And my people,

313
00:16:25,332 --> 00:16:29,336
well, they're a desperate bunch.

314
00:16:30,554 --> 00:16:31,816
And "desperation",

315
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,864
man, there is power
in that word.

316
00:16:38,823 --> 00:16:43,784
What would it take for you,
Chuck Smith, to be desperate?

317
00:16:43,785 --> 00:16:46,004
<i>The psychedelic experience</i>

318
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:49,877

00:16:49,878 --> 00:16:51,967
<i>It's a spiritual awakening.</i>

<i>Lick the tab.

329
00:17:33,835 --> 00:17:35,141
We gotta get one.

330
00:17:40,537 --> 00:17:42,409
Janette tells me
you're a pastor.

331
00:17:43,975 --> 00:17:44,976
Yes.

332
00:17:46,021 --> 00:17:47,544
Currently.

333
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,287
I know we must seem
pretty strange.

334
00:17:53,768 --> 00:17:55,378
<i>But if you look a little deeper,</i>

335
00:17:56,814 --> 00:18:00,252
<i>if you look with love,
you'll see a bunch of kids</i>

336
00:18:00,253 --> 00:18:02,603
<i>that are searching
for all the right things</i>

337
00:18:03,952 --> 00:18:05,649
<i>just in all the wrong places.</i>

338
00:18:09,827 --> 00:18:11,438
<i>So, to answer your question,</i>

339
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,224
<i>how do I describe my people?</i>

340
00:18:18,184 --> 00:18:20,490
They're sheep without a Shepherd

341
00:18:21,752 --> 00:18:24,754
chasing hard after lies.

342
00:18:24,755 --> 00:18:28,672
And the trouble is,
your people reject them.

343
00:18:30,674 --> 00:18:32,502
So, I ask you, pastor,

344
00:18:34,287 --> 00:18:37,681
"how can they believe in the one
of whom they have not heard?"

345
00:18:39,814 --> 00:18:42,425
We can only walk through
doors open to us.

346
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:45,298
And your church,

347
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,388
well,

348
00:18:49,693 --> 00:18:51,042
that's a door that's shut.

I was just covering up for her.

Oh, but you know
everything, right?

417
00:23:15,045 --> 00:23:17,003
I didn't say that.

418
00:23:17,004 --> 00:23:18,744
You and your sister,

You got us pegged.

We're all just a bunch
of junkies and a bunch
of burnouts.

422

But you know what?

423
00:23:27,275 --> 00:23:29,450
We're actually paying attention.

424
00:23:29,451 --> 00:23:32,192
We see what's really
going on in the world.

425
00:23:32,193 --> 00:23:34,063
I see a young lady
who is gonna end up

in an alley with a needle
in her arm.

- Yeah, I'm already going.

some pretty amazing things.

I can't think of anybody else

I was reading

00:26:18,315 --> 00:26:21,579
"And your sons and your
daughters shall prophesy.

490
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,929
"And your young men
shall see visions.

491
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:26,409
"And your old men
shall dream dreams.

492
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:28,324
"I will, in those days,

493
00:26:28,325 --> 00:26:30,240
"pour forth my spirit."

494
00:26:32,852 --> 00:26:36,071
This is what's going on
in San Fran.

495
00:26:36,072 --> 00:26:38,771
And I think it's about
to start happening all over.

496
00:26:40,207 --> 00:26:42,643
Everything's about
to change, folks,

497
00:26:42,644 --> 00:26:44,906
whether you're
ready for it or not.

498
00:26:44,907 --> 00:26:47,910
You can't run from it.
You can't hide from it.

499
00:26:49,042 --> 00:26:50,259
It's coming for you.

500
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,913
It's coming for all of you.

501
00:26:51,914 --> 00:26:53,176
And your children too.

502
00:26:55,744 --> 00:26:57,005
It's exciting, right?

503
00:26:57,006 --> 00:26:58,312
Okay, Chuck.

504
00:26:59,792 --> 00:27:01,444
<i>You wanna grow the congregation,</i>

505
00:27:01,445 --> 00:27:02,576
<i>I understand that.</i>

506
00:27:02,577 --> 00:27:03,622
But that?

507
00:27:04,971 --> 00:27:06,146
This is not it.

508
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,191
They don't belong here.

509
00:27:09,149 --> 00:27:10,716
Agreed?

510
00:27:20,987 --> 00:27:23,249
Warhol isn't real art.

511
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:24,598
He just holds up a mirror.

512
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:26,774
The emptiness, you know,
the materialism

513
00:27:26,775 --> 00:27:29,342
the religion of celebrity.

514
00:27:29,343 --> 00:27:30,778
Dig it, man.

515
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:32,737
It's like you say everything
that I'm thinking.

516
00:27:32,738 --> 00:27:34,173
It's 'cause cats

517
00:27:34,174 --> 00:27:36,479
like warhol, you know,
it's what they effectuate.

518
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,003
It's the change

519
00:27:38,004 --> 00:27:41,789
that they cause, and they
inspire for other artists.

520
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:44,052
See what happens 'cause
without warhol,

521
00:27:44,053 --> 00:27:47,186
there's no <i>sergeant pepper's,</i>

522
00:27:47,187 --> 00:27:49,579
there's no velvet underground.

523
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,668
The doors.

524
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,191
Doors. There's no doors.

525
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:54,498
And once art changes,

526
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,632
then everything changes.

527
00:27:58,633 --> 00:28:01,069
I mean, give me a break.
Nothing ever changes

528
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,984
anyone who tries just gets shot.

529
00:28:02,985 --> 00:28:06,554
Martin Luther King, and jfk,
and now his brother.

530
00:28:07,598 --> 00:28:09,599
Maybe that's our purpose, guys.

531
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,819
We just overthrow everything.

532
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,342
That's what we do.

533
00:28:13,343 --> 00:28:16,955
You know, we open up a portal
to, like, a whole new...

534
00:28:16,956 --> 00:28:18,740
Uh, like, a whole new...

535
00:28:19,436 --> 00:28:21,350
- Uh...

536
00:28:21,351 --> 00:28:23,702
I can't remember
what I was saying.

537
00:28:25,573 --> 00:28:26,748
What was I saying?

538
00:28:29,577 --> 00:28:31,100
Was I saying something?

539
00:28:36,497 --> 00:28:38,106
Dodie?
Dodie, what's wrong?

540
00:28:38,107 --> 00:28:39,152
Dodie?

541
00:28:40,283 --> 00:28:43,111
Dodie, what's wrong? Dodie?

542
00:28:43,112 --> 00:28:45,461
Dodie, please wake up. Please.

543
00:28:45,462 --> 00:28:46,594
Please, god.

544
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:48,290
Dodie?

545
00:28:48,291 --> 00:28:50,336
I don't know what to do.
Is there a phone?

546
00:28:50,337 --> 00:28:52,077
Dodie? Dodie?

547
00:28:52,078 --> 00:28:53,861
Turn her over.
Turn her over.

548
00:28:53,862 --> 00:28:54,994
Turn her over on her side.

549
00:29:14,404 --> 00:29:15,405
Okay.

550
00:29:16,842 --> 00:29:17,842
Okay.

551
00:29:20,933 --> 00:29:22,151
So, what did I miss?

552
00:29:32,988 --> 00:29:34,510
Sorry about that.

553
00:29:34,511 --> 00:29:35,904
It was scary.
It's like...

554
00:29:38,864 --> 00:29:40,299
That's your dad?
Yeah, he's...

555
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,475
Chuck, there's more of them.

556
00:29:42,476 --> 00:29:44,347
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

557
00:29:45,696 --> 00:29:48,177
I guess I'm just gonna
have to ask them to leave.

558
00:29:49,135 --> 00:29:50,439
Sounds great.

559
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,051
2

560
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:53,878
excuse me.

561
00:29:53,879 --> 00:29:55,444
- Who are you?
- Hi, Chuck.

562
00:29:55,445 --> 00:29:58,230
That's Ron. This is mickie.

563
00:29:58,231 --> 00:30:00,014
That's Lynette at the table.

564
00:30:00,015 --> 00:30:01,842
Hey, Ron.
- New brothers and sisters.

565
00:30:01,843 --> 00:30:03,626
Hope it's okay
they stay here too.

566
00:30:03,627 --> 00:30:04,845
Isn't it great, dad?

567
00:30:04,846 --> 00:30:06,716
No. It's not.

568
00:30:06,717 --> 00:30:08,197
- Oh.

569
00:30:09,024 --> 00:30:10,155
And I'm Connie.

570
00:30:10,156 --> 00:30:11,939
Yes. My wife, Connie.

571
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,158
You're married?

572
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:14,855
Wow, you're a real pastor, huh?

573
00:30:14,856 --> 00:30:17,336
That's a trip. We're gonna have
some questions for you, mister.

574
00:30:17,337 --> 00:30:18,904
Maybe later. Yeah.

575
00:30:21,994 --> 00:30:23,733
Are they camping in my yard?

576
00:30:23,734 --> 00:30:25,344
Oh, it's okay,
don't worry about them.

577
00:30:25,345 --> 00:30:26,780
They're used to it.
They don't mind.

578
00:30:26,781 --> 00:30:28,696
Wait till you see who's in here.

579
00:30:31,873 --> 00:30:33,439
What have you done to my home?

580
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,180
What are these people
doing here?

581
00:30:35,181 --> 00:30:37,225
Met them at a coffee shop
in Newport.

582
00:30:37,226 --> 00:30:38,793
Hey, man. Nice house.

583
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,119
What are they doing in my house?

584
00:30:43,015 --> 00:30:44,233
'Cause I had this idea.

585
00:30:45,234 --> 00:30:47,322
If you wanna reach my people,

586
00:30:47,323 --> 00:30:50,760
you need to speak to them
in a language they understand.

587
00:30:50,761 --> 00:30:52,980
If I bring them into my church,

588
00:30:52,981 --> 00:30:54,242
I'm gonna lose my job.

589
00:30:54,243 --> 00:30:56,723
Just listen, huh?
Sit here.

590
00:30:56,724 --> 00:30:59,030
Hey, guys. Can we just
give him a taste?

591
00:30:59,031 --> 00:31:00,728
Two, three, four.

00:33:10,162 --> 00:33:11,858
I've never been
in a church before.

619
00:33:11,859 --> 00:33:13,903
- I don't think any of us have.

620
00:33:13,904 --> 00:33:15,296
We call ourselves love song

621
00:33:15,297 --> 00:33:19,083
because, well, we sing songs
about love.

622
00:33:19,084 --> 00:33:20,910
Real love. You dig it?

623
00:33:20,911 --> 00:33:22,870
- One way, man.

624
00:33:25,481 --> 00:33:28,006
Now, we're gonna be back here
next Sunday as well

625
00:33:28,745 --> 00:33:30,355
except for Tommy.

626
00:33:30,356 --> 00:33:32,487
He's, uh, gotta serve out
the rest of his drug sentence.

627
00:33:32,488 --> 00:33:33,836
That happens.

628
00:33:33,837 --> 00:33:35,534
But he only has
three more months.

629
00:33:35,535 --> 00:33:37,537
- So, praise the lord.

630

Gosh.

631
00:33:40,627 --> 00:33:43,411
And thank you to pastor Chuck
for having us come through.

632
00:33:43,412 --> 00:33:46,024
Thank you, fellas.
It sounds great.

633
00:33:49,853 --> 00:33:50,854
This is truth.

634
00:33:51,464 --> 00:33:52,942
This is life.

635
00:33:52,943 --> 00:33:54,206
This is god's word.

636
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,258
Let's open it together.

<i>What light
through yonder window breaks?</i>

638

<i>Art thou not Romeo
and a montague?</i>

639
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,745
<i>Neither, fair maid,
if either thee dislike.</i>

640
00:34:12,746 --> 00:34:14,703
I can feel the words, man.

did I o'er-perch these walls.</i>

642
00:34:17,403 --> 00:34:18,838
Like, inside.

<i>For stony limits cannot
hold love out.</i>

644
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:24,148
<i>And what love can do
that dares love attempt.</i>

645
00:34:24,149 --> 00:34:25,410
<i>Therefore thy kinsmen</i>

646
00:34:25,411 --> 00:34:26,977
<i>- are no stop to me.
- Shh!</i>

647
00:34:28,849 --> 00:34:30,284
I finally see.

648
00:34:30,285 --> 00:34:32,113
<i>Oh, gentle Romeo,</i>

649
00:34:33,332 --> 00:34:34,507
<i>if thou dost love,</i>

650
00:34:35,334 --> 00:34:37,292
<i>pronounce it faithfully.</i>

651
00:34:54,483 --> 00:34:56,093
Cathe!

652
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,311
- Hi.

653
00:34:57,312 --> 00:34:58,486
There you are!

654
00:34:58,487 --> 00:34:59,532
What are you doing?

655
00:35:00,576 --> 00:35:01,968
I have to tell...

656
00:35:01,969 --> 00:35:03,752
I have been looking
everywhere for you.

657
00:35:03,753 --> 00:35:05,406
He's coming over here, isn't he?

658
00:35:05,407 --> 00:35:07,626
- I can't do this right now.
- I'm sorry.

659
00:35:07,627 --> 00:35:09,018
Hi. Cathe.

660
00:35:09,019 --> 00:35:10,412
- Cathe. Cathe.

661
00:35:12,153 --> 00:35:13,458
- Cathe. Cathe. Wait.

662
00:35:13,459 --> 00:35:14,676
What is your problem?

663
00:35:14,677 --> 00:35:16,157
- What is my problem?
- Yeah.

664
00:35:18,203 --> 00:35:20,640
My sister almost died, Greg.

665
00:35:22,163 --> 00:35:23,164
That's my problem.

666
00:35:24,339 --> 00:35:25,470
It's what I'm seeing.

667
00:35:25,471 --> 00:35:28,037
So, no.

668
00:35:28,038 --> 00:35:31,041
No, I don't wanna go with you
on your little trip.

669
00:35:49,451 --> 00:35:50,712
Hey.

670
00:35:50,713 --> 00:35:52,498
Get in. It's gonna be fun.

671
00:35:55,588 --> 00:35:57,284
<i>Mom, where are we going?</i>

672
00:35:57,285 --> 00:35:59,068
<i>Sunny California.</i>

673
00:35:59,069 --> 00:36:02,202
<i>Warm weather, beaches.
You're gonna love it.</i>

674
00:36:02,203 --> 00:36:04,422
<i>But what about dad?</i>

675
00:36:04,423 --> 00:36:06,338
Mom, we have to wait for him.

676
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:11,647
He's not coming back, Greg.

677
00:36:13,649 --> 00:36:15,477
It's what people do.
They leave.

678
00:36:17,218 --> 00:36:18,741
<i>So we're moving on.</i>

679
00:36:26,575 --> 00:36:28,751
Oh, no. Come on, gerger.

680
00:36:30,144 --> 00:36:31,579
Help me out here.

681
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:32,886
Hey. Hey.

682
00:36:37,586 --> 00:36:39,414
That's the spirit.

683
00:36:53,646 --> 00:36:56,343
<i>These kids are
runaways, most of them.</i>

684
00:36:56,344 --> 00:36:59,781
They got drug addictions,
medical issues.

685
00:36:59,782 --> 00:37:01,000
And they need our help.

686
00:37:01,001 --> 00:37:02,045
Yeah, but, Chuck...

687
00:37:03,395 --> 00:37:05,004
I mean, they need to go home.

688
00:37:05,005 --> 00:37:07,355
They're making our
congregation uncomfortable.

689
00:37:08,617 --> 00:37:10,096
Well, maybe they should
be uncomfortable.

690
00:37:10,097 --> 00:37:12,141
Maybe we all should.

691
00:37:12,142 --> 00:37:16,407
Maybe it's my job
to make us uncomfortable.

692
00:37:16,408 --> 00:37:17,756
And I haven't been doing it.

693
00:37:17,757 --> 00:37:18,974
Chuck, stop.

694
00:37:18,975 --> 00:37:20,020
This is enough.

695
00:37:21,108 --> 00:37:22,543
This is a house of worship.

696
00:37:22,544 --> 00:37:24,763
And, yes, we expect
a certain level of dignity here.

697
00:37:24,764 --> 00:37:26,417
These girls are wearing
halter tops,

698
00:37:26,418 --> 00:37:28,070
and half of them aren't
even wearing shoes.

699
00:37:28,071 --> 00:37:30,987
They're staining the new shag
carpet with their bare feet.

700
00:37:32,554 --> 00:37:33,554
The carpet?

701
00:37:33,816 --> 00:37:35,121
Mmm.

702
00:37:35,122 --> 00:37:38,211
Oh. Yeah, let's be sure
to save the carpet.

703
00:37:38,212 --> 00:37:39,995
You keep this up,
and you're gonna drive away

704
00:37:39,996 --> 00:37:42,737
the only contributing members
that we've got.

705
00:37:42,738 --> 00:37:43,739
You hearing me now?

706
00:37:45,045 --> 00:37:46,046
Loud and clear.

707
00:37:49,092 --> 00:37:50,267
<i>Unlike the individual,</i>

708
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,269
<i>they seize it by one act
of violence.</i>

709
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,358
So many voices.

710
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,392
It's hard to hear the truth.

711
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,100
Truth is always quiet.

712
00:37:58,101 --> 00:38:00,147
It's the lies that are loud.

713
00:38:02,671 --> 00:38:03,759
It's complicated.

714
00:38:07,546 --> 00:38:08,851
The truth is simple.

715
00:38:23,953 --> 00:38:25,215
What is going on?

716
00:38:33,789 --> 00:38:36,182
You can put that
right over there on that towel.

717
00:38:36,183 --> 00:38:38,011
Give me this other one here.
There we go.

718
00:38:39,186 --> 00:38:40,491
I baptize these feet in the name

719
00:38:40,492 --> 00:38:41,666
of the father, the son,
and the holy ghost.

720
00:38:41,667 --> 00:38:42,884
There you go.
Welcome to church.

721
00:38:42,885 --> 00:38:44,146
Thank you.

722
00:38:44,147 --> 00:38:46,715
Hello, you. Let's have
that foot, please.

723
00:38:47,803 --> 00:38:49,717
This is terrific.
There we go.

724
00:38:49,718 --> 00:38:51,458
Okay.

725
00:38:51,459 --> 00:38:54,200
Place them both on that towel,
and then step on into church.

726
00:38:54,201 --> 00:38:56,158
- Welcome.
Thank you.

727
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:57,638
Hello, young lady.
How are you?

728
00:38:57,639 --> 00:38:59,380
Good.
- Let's have that foot.

729
00:39:09,434 --> 00:39:11,479
Let's have that other foot.

730
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,266
Why don't you go sit
next to that fella

731
00:39:17,267 --> 00:39:18,877
- in the cantaloupe jacket.

732
00:39:18,878 --> 00:39:20,313
Good to see you.

733
00:39:20,314 --> 00:39:21,532
Thank you.
- Enjoy. Welcome to church.

734
00:39:21,533 --> 00:39:23,577
Thank you.
- Hello, young lady.

735
00:39:23,578 --> 00:39:25,623
<i>Well, last year, I had
the privilege of visiting,</i>

736
00:39:25,624 --> 00:39:26,973
uh, New York City.

737
00:39:28,714 --> 00:39:29,931
And like any other tourist,

738
00:39:29,932 --> 00:39:32,717
I paid a visit
to the statue of Liberty,

739
00:39:32,718 --> 00:39:33,936
and I read those famous words.

740
00:39:35,285 --> 00:39:37,113
"Give me your tired, your poor,

741
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:39,246
"your huddled masses,

742
00:39:40,595 --> 00:39:42,031
"yearning to breathe free."

743
00:39:43,685 --> 00:39:46,079
And as I read those words,
I thought, well, that's

744
00:39:47,907 --> 00:39:50,822
christianity, isn't it?

745
00:39:50,823 --> 00:39:53,347
I mean, it's the essence of it.

746
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,959
An invitation to the broken.

747
00:39:58,744 --> 00:40:02,224
Jesus was very friendly
with the outcasts.

748
00:40:02,225 --> 00:40:03,749
In revelation 22, it says,

749
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:08,274
"let the one who can hear say,
'come.'

750
00:40:08,275 --> 00:40:10,102
"let the one who is thirsty come.

751
00:40:10,103 --> 00:40:12,584
"Let the one who desires

752
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:17,284
"take the waters
of life freely."

753
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:21,897
I want you all to look at me. Uh...

754
00:40:22,768 --> 00:40:23,769
Please.

755
00:40:24,987 --> 00:40:25,988
Every one of you.

756
00:40:33,996 --> 00:40:35,258
This place,

757
00:40:39,872 --> 00:40:41,351
it is yours.

758
00:40:44,833 --> 00:40:46,443
I don't...

759
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:49,533
I don't care if anybody else
thinks so.

760
00:40:49,534 --> 00:40:51,926
If... if you feel
like you're an outcast...

761
00:40:51,927 --> 00:40:54,843
Then join us here.

762
00:40:55,627 --> 00:40:56,889
If you feel like

763
00:40:58,281 --> 00:41:00,674
you're misunderstood and judged,

764
00:41:00,675 --> 00:41:02,284
this is where you belong.

765
00:41:02,285 --> 00:41:04,636
If you feel ashamed or trapped

766
00:41:06,072 --> 00:41:08,117
in something you've done
or are doing,

767
00:41:11,817 --> 00:41:12,905
you will find

768
00:41:14,602 --> 00:41:17,387
forgiveness and freedom...

769
00:41:20,434 --> 00:41:21,435
Right here.

770
00:41:25,918 --> 00:41:27,006
No guilt trips.

771
00:41:29,922 --> 00:41:31,053
This is your home.

772
00:41:32,838 --> 00:41:35,753
And I want you to tell
all your friends about it.

773
00:41:35,754 --> 00:41:36,798
There is a place for you.

774
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:42,542
Now that door is open
all the time for you.

775
00:41:42,543 --> 00:41:44,588
Any time of day.

776
00:41:44,589 --> 00:41:47,286
And if there are some
who don't like that,

777
00:41:47,287 --> 00:41:50,595
well, then, that door
is open for you too.

778
00:41:52,727 --> 00:41:53,859
It works both ways.

779
00:42:29,634 --> 00:42:32,505
All right, pastor.
Let's begin.

780
00:42:32,506 --> 00:42:33,551
- Let's begin.

781
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:35,639
Hey, Chuck.

782
00:42:37,511 --> 00:42:39,165
You're gonna need
a bigger church.

783
00:43:18,726 --> 00:43:20,597
Hey, Charlie, slow down, man.

784
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:21,816
Relax, man.

785
00:43:24,645 --> 00:43:27,256
Charlie, hey, man.
Hey, stop swerving, man.

786
00:43:30,259 --> 00:43:31,956
Charlie, slow down, man.
Slow down.

787
00:43:31,957 --> 00:43:33,132
- Slow down!

788
00:43:34,263 --> 00:43:36,613
Hey. Charlie. Charlie, man.

789
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:39,529
Steer right, man!
Steer right! Steer right!

790
00:43:43,098 --> 00:43:45,797
- Get off the wheel, man!
No, no.

791
00:43:48,016 --> 00:43:49,800
Hey, man.

792
00:43:49,801 --> 00:43:51,237
We're gonna die.

793
00:43:55,937 --> 00:43:57,024
Slow down, man! Slow down!

794
00:43:57,025 --> 00:43:59,158
Slow down! Slow down!
Slow down!

795
00:44:07,993 --> 00:44:09,603
You all right back there, man?

796
00:44:12,127 --> 00:44:14,347
Get me out of here!

797
00:44:25,793 --> 00:44:27,621
Get out of the road, man!

798
00:44:53,603 --> 00:44:56,083
I don't wanna die.
I don't wanna die.

799
00:44:56,084 --> 00:44:58,303
I don't wanna die.

800
00:44:58,304 --> 00:45:00,785
Hey. Hey. All right.
Hey, hey, hey.

801
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:04,918
It's all right, brother.

802
00:45:04,919 --> 00:45:06,703
I'm dying. I'm gonna die.

803
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:08,661
That's the drugs
lying to you, man.

804
00:45:08,662 --> 00:45:11,099
You're alive. I promise you.

805
00:45:13,275 --> 00:45:14,668
What's your name?

806
00:45:16,975 --> 00:45:19,106
Greg. Greg.

807
00:45:19,107 --> 00:45:20,629
It's all right.
It's all right.

808
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:22,501
I'm Lonnie.

809
00:45:22,502 --> 00:45:24,547
You ran past my house screaming.

810
00:45:25,244 --> 00:45:26,766
And I just followed you.

811
00:45:26,767 --> 00:45:27,768
Just breathe.

812
00:45:29,291 --> 00:45:31,205
Lonnie, be honest with me, man.
Are you really here?

813
00:45:31,206 --> 00:45:32,207
Are you really here?

814
00:45:33,034 --> 00:45:35,253
Yeah, man, I'm really here.

815
00:45:35,254 --> 00:45:36,776
And I'm gonna sit with you here

816
00:45:36,777 --> 00:45:38,126
as long as it takes, okay?

817
00:45:39,693 --> 00:45:42,478
What are you doing out here?
What are you running from?

818
00:45:44,524 --> 00:45:45,655
I don't know.

819
00:45:50,573 --> 00:45:52,532
Hey. Where are you going?

820
00:45:56,275 --> 00:45:57,276
Hey, Greg.

821
00:46:00,105 --> 00:46:02,063
God says you don't
have to run anymore.

822
00:46:19,646 --> 00:46:20,690
What's up, man?

823
00:46:23,041 --> 00:46:25,390
Last night was crazy,
wasn't it? A little bit.

824
00:46:25,391 --> 00:46:26,870
Ah, yeah, we could've died.

825
00:46:26,871 --> 00:46:28,132
Nah, come on, man.

826
00:46:28,133 --> 00:46:30,438
We're going to live
forever, greggo.

827
00:46:30,439 --> 00:46:31,613
That's the thing, man.

828
00:46:31,614 --> 00:46:32,659
Dexter!

829
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:35,053
You have some weed of mine.

830
00:46:36,228 --> 00:46:37,924
<i>Man, slave owners, you know,</i>

831
00:46:37,925 --> 00:46:41,841
<i>they were pushing religion
onto the slaves that they owned</i>

832
00:46:41,842 --> 00:46:45,540
<i>whose blood and features
that I bear.</i>

833
00:46:45,541 --> 00:46:47,151
<i>- Christianity supports...</i>
- I'm Greg Laurie.

834
00:46:47,152 --> 00:46:48,587
<i>Property owners in the city.</i>

835
00:46:48,588 --> 00:46:49,806
<i>The police, military...</i>

836
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:51,242
Oh. Yeah, right,
I think I remember you.

837
00:46:51,243 --> 00:46:52,330
- Oh, you do remember?
- Yeah.

838
00:46:52,331 --> 00:46:53,984
Oh, nice.

839
00:46:53,985 --> 00:46:55,505
Does that mean you're done
ignoring me?

840
00:46:56,335 --> 00:46:57,683
I don't know.

841
00:46:57,684 --> 00:46:59,032
<i>And it's just never
been any good.</i>

842
00:46:59,033 --> 00:47:00,729
I've just been figuring
some stuff out.

843
00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:02,122
<i>No religion's
really good, really.</i>

844
00:47:02,123 --> 00:47:03,471
Yeah.

845
00:47:03,472 --> 00:47:05,112
<i>- You just gotta dig people...</i>
- You okay?

846
00:47:06,606 --> 00:47:09,042
- Yeah. Just, uh...
<i>And dig each other.</i>

847
00:47:09,043 --> 00:47:10,739
Figuring some stuff out.

848
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:13,352
<i>Now I think the, uh,
Satan people wanna talk.</i>

849
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:21,751
<i>Hail Satan.</i>

850
00:47:24,972 --> 00:47:28,845
So, this is very creepy,
and we should leave, right?

851
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:31,543
- Before he starts
sacrificing us.

852
00:47:31,544 --> 00:47:33,546
I'm... I'm waiting to hear
someone talk.

853
00:47:34,982 --> 00:47:36,896
That guy,
sitting right over there.

854
00:47:36,897 --> 00:47:38,767
Oh, I see.

855
00:47:38,768 --> 00:47:41,335
The Jesus guy.

856
00:47:41,336 --> 00:47:43,685
- Huh. This is a tragedy.

857
00:47:43,686 --> 00:47:45,296
- This is very sad...
Thanks, man.

858
00:47:45,297 --> 00:47:46,863
For me to hear right now,
okay? We're losing our girl

859
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:48,299
to the dark side,
and you're not even...

860
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:49,474
What are you looking at?

861
00:47:49,475 --> 00:47:51,650
<i>That was really far out.</i>

862
00:47:51,651 --> 00:47:53,913
The magic bus is leaving
in seven minutes, folks.

863
00:47:53,914 --> 00:47:55,220
<i>I'm really glad to be here.</i>

864
00:47:56,090 --> 00:47:57,395
<i>Really, all I got to bring</i>

865
00:47:57,396 --> 00:48:01,225
<i>is what the Bible calls
the good news.</i>

866
00:48:01,226 --> 00:48:04,532
So, this is what you've been
trying to figure out?

867
00:48:04,533 --> 00:48:06,230
<i>In the gospel of Matthew...</i>

868
00:48:06,231 --> 00:48:08,362
- Yeah. Mostly.
<i>Jesus said,</i>

869
00:48:08,363 --> 00:48:10,408
<i>"come unto me all ye that labor.</i>

870
00:48:10,409 --> 00:48:13,411
- There's this, um, church.
<i>"...And are heavy laden...</i>

871
00:48:13,412 --> 00:48:15,021
It's called

872
00:48:15,022 --> 00:48:15,936
- calvary chapel.
<i>"...And I will
give you rest.</i>

873
00:48:15,937 --> 00:48:17,589
<i>"Take my yoke upon you...</i>

874
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:19,069
You could come.

875
00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:20,592
<i>"...and learn from me,
for I am meek...</i>

876
00:48:20,593 --> 00:48:21,854
Why not?

877
00:48:21,855 --> 00:48:23,029
<i>"...and lowly
in heart...</i>

878
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:24,639
We say we're looking for truth.

879
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,163
What if this is true?

880
00:48:26,164 --> 00:48:27,947
<i>"Ye shall find rest
unto your souls."</i>

881
00:48:27,948 --> 00:48:29,601
'Cause everything
that we've been trying...

882
00:48:29,602 --> 00:48:31,124
<i>There's a lot of heavy
stuff happening right now.</i>

883
00:48:31,125 --> 00:48:33,692
It's not working for me.

884
00:48:33,693 --> 00:48:35,433
<i>Jesus wants you know...</i>
And this...

885
00:48:35,434 --> 00:48:37,130
<i>You don't have
to deal with it on your own.</i>

886
00:48:37,131 --> 00:48:39,655
I don't know.
It's something I haven't
heard before.

887
00:48:40,874 --> 00:48:42,005
It's different.

888
00:48:42,006 --> 00:48:44,355
<i>Let him take it from you.</i>

889
00:48:44,356 --> 00:48:46,271
<i>- Let him help you.</i>
- Come on.

890
00:48:50,536 --> 00:48:52,146
<i>Jesus also said,</i>

891
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,845
<i>"whoever is not with me</i>

892
00:48:57,021 --> 00:48:58,935
<i>"is against me.</i>

893
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:02,113
<i>"And whoever does not
gather with me scatters."</i>

894
00:49:02,809 --> 00:49:04,071
<i>You have to decide</i>

895
00:49:08,249 --> 00:49:09,381
<i>for yourself.</i>

896
00:49:12,775 --> 00:49:14,473
<i>We all have to decide.</i>

897
00:49:22,568 --> 00:49:25,266
<i>♪ These are common
words but true</i>

898

<i>♪ And use your own two hands</i>

904

908
00:50:17,492 --> 00:50:20,104
Thanks, guys.
That was beautiful.

909
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:28,851
Jesus Christ willingly

910
00:50:29,896 --> 00:50:31,289
went to the cross,

911
00:50:34,248 --> 00:50:35,423
and he died.

912
00:50:36,598 --> 00:50:37,773
He gave his life.

913
00:50:39,079 --> 00:50:42,864
He became a sacrifice
for all of us here

914
00:50:42,865 --> 00:50:46,781
so that we might be
forgiven of our sins.

915
00:50:46,782 --> 00:50:48,741
That we might be reborn

916
00:50:49,481 --> 00:50:50,569
of water

917
00:50:52,223 --> 00:50:53,223
and the spirit.

918
00:50:54,573 --> 00:50:55,877
- That's why we're going down...

919
00:50:55,878 --> 00:50:57,184
To the ocean this weekend.

920
00:51:00,622 --> 00:51:02,798
So many of you
wanna be baptized.

921
00:51:04,148 --> 00:51:06,149
And, well, you look around,

922
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:07,802
we don't have any more room.

923
00:51:07,803 --> 00:51:10,284
This place is packed
even on a Monday night.

924
00:51:15,898 --> 00:51:17,682
So we're going down
to the beach,

925
00:51:17,683 --> 00:51:20,425
Saturday afternoon
at pirate's cove.

926
00:51:21,339 --> 00:51:22,991
Maybe I'll wear my eye patch.

927
00:51:22,992 --> 00:51:24,472
- Arr!

928
00:51:27,127 --> 00:51:29,129
Let's all turn our bibles now.

929
00:51:30,565 --> 00:51:31,913
John, chapter three.

930
00:51:31,914 --> 00:51:33,133
I need help!

931
00:51:35,788 --> 00:51:37,006
I'm gonna die.

932
00:51:38,182 --> 00:51:40,966
I can't stop. I need help.

933
00:51:40,967 --> 00:51:43,751
No, you're all right, brother.
You're all right. It's okay.

934
00:51:43,752 --> 00:51:45,276
- You're all right.

935
00:51:46,451 --> 00:51:48,365
You're safe here.

936
00:51:48,366 --> 00:51:50,063
You're not gonna die.

937
00:51:50,716 --> 00:51:52,021
Not on my watch.

938
00:51:53,545 --> 00:51:54,981
There is hope for you here.

939
00:52:00,073 --> 00:52:02,641
Let's all pray for him. Guys,
come on. Help me pray for him.

940
00:52:12,216 --> 00:52:13,520
Heavenly father, we thank you

941
00:52:13,521 --> 00:52:15,522
for all your loving
and gracious gifts

942
00:52:15,523 --> 00:52:18,917
from your spirit that you send
down upon this man right now

943
00:52:18,918 --> 00:52:21,049
to be healed in Jesus' name.

944
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:22,400
We thank you, lord.

945
00:52:27,448 --> 00:52:29,363
In the name of Jesus Christ...

946
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:56,607
Will you just give
this a chance?

947
00:52:56,608 --> 00:52:58,174
I don't know,
I think it might be real.

948
00:52:58,175 --> 00:52:59,654
That's the problem, cathe.

949
00:53:01,221 --> 00:53:02,526
Look, I can't...

950
00:53:02,527 --> 00:53:04,268
I just can't be let down again.

951
00:53:06,574 --> 00:53:08,097
What I felt in there, I
haven't...

952
00:53:08,576 --> 00:53:09,577
I know.

953
00:53:11,013 --> 00:53:13,101
What if it's another high?

954
00:53:13,102 --> 00:53:15,408
What if it's just
another drug, you know?

955
00:53:15,409 --> 00:53:17,062
It's good for a minute,
and then it's gone.

956
00:53:17,063 --> 00:53:18,107
What then?

957
00:53:20,414 --> 00:53:21,720
We can find out together.

958
00:53:47,963 --> 00:53:49,486
- Come on.
- It's just water.

959
00:53:49,487 --> 00:53:51,139
I'm just saying,
what is it gonna prove?

960
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:52,924
You're right, it's just water.
So why are you freaking out?

961
00:53:52,925 --> 00:53:54,753
I'm not freaking out.
I'm not freaking out.

962
00:54:00,976 --> 00:54:02,977
Okay, I'm freaking out
a little bit.

963
00:54:02,978 --> 00:54:04,241
You're gonna be fine.

964
00:54:10,464 --> 00:54:11,856
Do you fully accept Jesus Christ

965
00:54:11,857 --> 00:54:13,161
as your lord and savior?

966
00:54:13,162 --> 00:54:14,728
Yes, I do.
- Then I baptize you,

967
00:54:14,729 --> 00:54:17,558
in the name of the father,
the son, and the holy spirit.

968
00:54:21,997 --> 00:54:23,521
Today you are transformed.

969
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:29,700
Your heart, your soul, your life
will never be the same.

970
00:54:29,701 --> 00:54:31,137
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

971
00:54:34,445 --> 00:54:36,055
How did that feel?
- You'll see.

972
00:54:41,756 --> 00:54:42,757
Hi.

973
00:54:44,019 --> 00:54:45,237
Greg, right?

974
00:54:45,238 --> 00:54:46,370
Yeah.

975
00:54:47,458 --> 00:54:48,893
I have been praying
for this moment

976
00:54:48,894 --> 00:54:50,416
since I met first you.

977
00:54:50,417 --> 00:54:51,852
Have you decided?

978
00:54:51,853 --> 00:54:54,291
Um, I... I don't know.

979
00:54:55,727 --> 00:54:57,337
You wanna decide right now?

980
00:54:59,687 --> 00:55:01,906
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

981
00:55:01,907 --> 00:55:02,951
Then pray with me.

982
00:55:05,258 --> 00:55:06,303
Lord Jesus,

983
00:55:07,913 --> 00:55:09,827
I know I'm a sinner.

984
00:55:09,828 --> 00:55:11,307
Lord Jesus, I know I'm a sinner.

985
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:12,960
You are the savior of the world.

986
00:55:12,961 --> 00:55:14,701
You are the savior of the world.

987
00:55:14,702 --> 00:55:16,312
I ask you to come into my life.

988
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:17,922
I ask you to come into my life.

989
00:55:17,923 --> 00:55:19,097
I repent for my sins.

990
00:55:19,098 --> 00:55:20,794
I repent for all my sins.

991
00:55:20,795 --> 00:55:23,797
And I accept you as my lord
and savior, my god, and friend.

992
00:55:23,798 --> 00:55:26,626
And I accept you as my lord and
savior, my god, and my friend.

993
00:55:26,627 --> 00:55:27,845
In Jesus' name...

994
00:55:27,846 --> 00:55:29,500
- In Jesus' name...
- Amen.

995
00:55:31,937 --> 00:55:35,461
Greg, I baptize you

996
00:55:35,462 --> 00:55:38,464
in the name of the father,
and of the son,

997
00:55:38,465 --> 00:55:39,814
and of the holy spirit.

998
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:41,380
Amen.

999
00:56:38,133 --> 00:56:39,612
How do you feel?

1000
00:56:39,613 --> 00:56:40,658
Alive.

1001
00:56:42,007 --> 00:56:43,312
Oh, my god.

1002
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:46,750
Thank you.

1003
00:58:00,215 --> 00:58:01,389
Yeah, so this guy is moving

1004
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:02,913
into the trailer with my mom,

1005
00:58:02,914 --> 00:58:05,481
and I have nowhere else to go.

1006
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:06,743
So, you sure it's okay I'm here?

1007
00:58:06,744 --> 00:58:08,528
Oh. Yeah, brother.
There's plenty of room.

1008
00:58:09,529 --> 00:58:11,051
Where did you get this place?

1009
00:58:11,052 --> 00:58:12,226
Kay found it,

1010
00:58:12,227 --> 00:58:14,620
- and Chuck rented it for us.
- Ah.

1011
00:58:14,621 --> 00:58:17,928
It's condemned, technically,
so it doesn't cost much.

1012
00:58:17,929 --> 00:58:20,148
I think, mainly, they wanted us
out of their home.

1013
00:58:20,758 --> 00:58:21,759
Which I get.

1014
00:58:23,325 --> 00:58:24,805
Welcome to paradise, brother.

1015
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:30,418
This is Lance. He used to work
for a big marketing firm.

1016
00:58:30,419 --> 00:58:31,768
Greg draws too.

1017
00:58:31,769 --> 00:58:35,206
That's bud, Marty,
Steven, and Suzie.

1018
00:58:35,207 --> 00:58:37,034
They're a bunch
of righteous cats.

1019
00:58:37,035 --> 00:58:39,558
Lot of artists here.
You'll fit right in, brother.

1020
00:58:39,559 --> 00:58:41,517
And janette, Chuck's daughter.

1021
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:42,910
Greg, finally!

1022
00:58:43,824 --> 00:58:45,042
And my wife, Connie.

1023
00:58:45,043 --> 00:58:46,304
Praise god.

1024
00:58:46,305 --> 00:58:48,262
I have heard so much about you.

1025
00:58:48,263 --> 00:58:49,742
- Okay.
Come on in.

1026
00:58:49,743 --> 00:58:51,439
- Make yourself at home.
Okay. That's great.

1027
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,398
Let's just give him
a little space, Connie, okay?

1028
00:58:53,399 --> 00:58:54,791
I'm just greeting him, Lonnie.

1029
00:58:54,792 --> 00:58:56,314
You're overwhelming him, Connie.

1030
00:58:56,315 --> 00:58:57,663
I'm okay.

1031
00:58:57,664 --> 00:58:59,622
Don't mind him.
He gets irritable.

1032
00:58:59,623 --> 00:59:00,971
Connie!

1033
00:59:00,972 --> 00:59:02,539
See? Irritable.

1034
00:59:04,932 --> 00:59:06,020
Come on up here, Greg.

1035
00:59:10,590 --> 00:59:12,461
Voila! Your own room.

1036
00:59:16,727 --> 00:59:18,990
Uh, that's not human blood.

1037
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:22,079
We had raccoons.

1038
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:24,168
They're tough little critters.

1039
00:59:24,169 --> 00:59:25,343
Don't mind the smell.

1040
00:59:25,344 --> 00:59:27,476
Yeah, that will be gone
in about a week.

1041
00:59:29,522 --> 00:59:30,654
It's perfect.

1042
00:59:31,437 --> 00:59:34,178
They're just people, Kay.

1043
00:59:34,179 --> 00:59:36,572
Crazy, weirdo, homeless,
drug people.

1044
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:39,140
But, yes, just people.

1045
00:59:42,491 --> 00:59:43,797
- Hello.
- How are you?

1046
00:59:46,321 --> 00:59:47,321
[Chuckles nervously] Hey.
- I can't believe

1047
00:59:47,322 --> 00:59:48,540
you're actually doing this.

1048
00:59:48,541 --> 00:59:50,237
Me either.

1049
00:59:50,238 --> 00:59:52,892
<i>In your name. Amen.</i>

1050
00:59:52,893 --> 00:59:55,156
Amen.
- All right. Dig in.

1051
01:00:01,728 --> 01:00:03,600
Hey. You doing all right?

1052
01:00:05,079 --> 01:00:06,079
Yeah, just...

1053
01:00:06,951 --> 01:00:08,429
Adjusting.

1054
01:00:08,430 --> 01:00:11,303
Relax. You're home now.

it's everything
I've been looking for.

1062
01:01:01,570 --> 01:01:04,661
I'm really glad that
we're in this together, but...

1063

But what?

1064

01:01:08,403 --> 01:01:10,361
then I wanna do it right.

1066
01:01:10,362 --> 01:01:12,407
So I just wanted
to tell you that

1067

if you ever get between
me and god,

1068

then it's over for us.

1069
01:01:21,112 --> 01:01:22,678
That sounded better in my head.

1070
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:24,376
Yeah, it was a little harsh.

1071
01:01:26,770 --> 01:01:28,728
Are you finally
officially asking me out?

1072
01:01:30,077 --> 01:01:33,515
What would you say if I were?

1073
01:01:34,865 --> 01:01:35,909
I don't know.

1074
01:01:36,518 --> 01:01:37,519
Ask me again.

1075
01:01:39,478 --> 01:01:40,696
Hey, Greg.

1076
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:42,741
<i>We have a surprise for you.</i>

1077
01:01:42,742 --> 01:01:43,830
<i>Come outside.</i>

1078
01:01:44,396 --> 01:01:45,397
Really?

1079
01:01:47,007 --> 01:01:49,400
We all pitched in,
and we got you a car.

1080
01:01:49,401 --> 01:01:50,488
So you don't have
to pick up your girlfriend

1081
01:01:50,489 --> 01:01:52,098
on a bicycle anymore.

1082
01:01:52,099 --> 01:01:53,100
Huh?

1083
01:01:54,188 --> 01:01:56,189
She's all yours, brother.

1084
01:01:56,190 --> 01:01:58,061
- This is my car?

1085
01:01:58,062 --> 01:01:59,237
She is yours.

1086
01:01:59,933 --> 01:02:01,717
This is my car?

1087
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:03,544
- Think he likes it.
- I do too.

1088
01:02:03,545 --> 01:02:04,632
Does it run?

1089
01:02:04,633 --> 01:02:05,808
Of course, it runs.

1090
01:02:05,809 --> 01:02:07,331
We all prayed over it
this morning.

1091
01:02:07,332 --> 01:02:08,419
I'm gonna fire it up.

1092
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:09,421
Get in there.
- Yeah.

1093
01:02:10,074 --> 01:02:11,249
Give it a whirl.

1094
01:02:15,209 --> 01:02:16,210
Okay.

1095
01:02:18,343 --> 01:02:19,648
Come on, lord.

1096
01:02:30,398 --> 01:02:32,270
It's just a warm-up.

1097
01:02:35,316 --> 01:02:36,622
Let's pray over it again, guys.

1098
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:40,103
Heavenly father,

1099
01:02:40,104 --> 01:02:42,670
we just thank you for sending
down your holy spirit

1100
01:02:42,671 --> 01:02:44,977
- into this car, especially...

1101
01:02:44,978 --> 01:02:47,153
Engine and the carburetor

1102
01:02:47,154 --> 01:02:49,765
that I was assured
was just replaced.

1103
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:51,027
- Thank you, lord.

1104
01:02:51,028 --> 01:02:52,680
Thank you. In Jesus' name...

1105
01:02:52,681 --> 01:02:54,596
- Amen.
Amen.

1106
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:58,425
Lord,
we're asking you here, please.

1107
01:02:58,426 --> 01:03:00,863
I'm looking bad right now,
lord. Please.

1108
01:03:00,864 --> 01:03:04,084
Just give us a little bit
of spirit juice here.

1109
01:03:05,216 --> 01:03:06,826
Yeah!

1110
01:03:08,045 --> 01:03:11,003
- Yes!

1111
01:03:11,004 --> 01:03:12,571
Thank you so much, guys.

1112
01:03:13,224 --> 01:03:14,442
I knew it would run.

1113
01:03:14,921 --> 01:03:15,966

Is that your car?

1118
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:41,947
It's a piece of junk.

1119
01:03:41,948 --> 01:03:43,209
It's amazing.

1120
01:03:43,210 --> 01:03:44,820
It's amazing, Greg.

1121

Thank you.

1125
01:03:54,918 --> 01:03:55,962
Sorry. One minute.

1126
01:03:58,225 --> 01:03:59,399
It's kind of stuck.

1127

1128

Okay.

1130
01:04:20,117 --> 01:04:22,771
So, what do you wanna
do after high school?

1131
01:04:23,772 --> 01:04:24,861
I don't know.

1132
01:04:27,994 --> 01:04:29,517
I just don't want this to end.

1133
01:04:31,824 --> 01:04:33,652
Do you ever worry
about that sometimes?

No.

1135
01:04:40,702 --> 01:04:42,182

Sometimes you think the only

[On TV] <i>That's the

1307
01:13:50,208 --> 01:13:51,730
I don't get it. We already have

1308
01:13:51,731 --> 01:13:53,079
our own Wednesday night service.

1309
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:54,777
Their church is struggling.

1310
01:13:54,778 --> 01:13:58,433
Father Malone
is getting a little older.

1311
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:00,871
He's having difficulty
reaching the youth.

1312
01:14:02,481 --> 01:14:04,003
Well, why don't you do it?

1313
01:14:04,004 --> 01:14:05,571
It's a youth service

1314
01:14:06,616 --> 01:14:08,182
for teens and 20s.

1315
01:14:09,096 --> 01:14:10,228
It's perfect for you.

1316
01:14:12,404 --> 01:14:14,231
You're trying to get rid of me.

1317
01:14:14,232 --> 01:14:15,841
Come on, Lonnie.

1318
01:14:15,842 --> 01:14:17,409
Please, don't get dramatic.

1319
01:14:18,366 --> 01:14:19,542
It's one night a week.

1320
01:14:21,152 --> 01:14:22,283
And...

1321
01:14:24,416 --> 01:14:27,592
There have been some concerns
about our methods.

1322
01:14:27,593 --> 01:14:29,508
I think it's time
we pull back on

1323
01:14:30,335 --> 01:14:31,336
the theatrics.

1324
01:14:34,295 --> 01:14:35,471
The theatrics?

1325
01:14:37,429 --> 01:14:38,951
Is that what you think I do?

1326
01:14:38,952 --> 01:14:41,084
- No, not per se.
- Theatrics?

1327
01:14:41,085 --> 01:14:44,000
Look, I think you're
an amazingly gifted man.

1328
01:14:44,001 --> 01:14:47,133
I think it's possible
you may actually walk

1329
01:14:47,134 --> 01:14:48,657
hand in hand with god.

1330
01:14:48,658 --> 01:14:52,095
I am so grateful
that you came here.

1331
01:14:52,096 --> 01:14:55,664
But we have to start
paying attention to the idea

1332
01:14:55,665 --> 01:14:57,883
that we can control
how we're perceived.

1333
01:14:57,884 --> 01:15:00,277
What does it matter
how we're perceived, Chuck?

1334
01:15:00,278 --> 01:15:03,149
Kids are getting saved
by the holy spirit.

1335
01:15:03,150 --> 01:15:04,977
And you can't control
the holy spirit, man.

1336
01:15:04,978 --> 01:15:07,546
But we can control our ministry.

1337
01:15:08,721 --> 01:15:09,721
And we must.

1338
01:15:11,724 --> 01:15:12,985
I'll cover things here

1339
01:15:12,986 --> 01:15:15,989
while you help them there.

1340
01:15:16,337 --> 01:15:18,469
No.

1341
01:15:18,470 --> 01:15:20,603
No, I don't feel the lord
calling me to that.

1342
01:15:21,473 --> 01:15:22,474
Mmm-mmm.

1343
01:15:23,083 --> 01:15:24,084
I'll do it.

1344
01:15:28,219 --> 01:15:29,525
Yeah, I, uh...

1345
01:15:30,482 --> 01:15:32,396
I feel called.

1346
01:15:32,397 --> 01:15:33,919
I was just picking up
more tracts.

1347
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:35,486
No, that's okay.

1348
01:15:35,487 --> 01:15:37,010
Uh, door's always open.

1349
01:15:37,707 --> 01:15:38,707
Uh...

1350
01:15:40,013 --> 01:15:41,274
Why not, Greg?

1351
01:15:41,275 --> 01:15:43,233
Far out. Great.

1352
01:15:43,234 --> 01:15:44,278
Okay, thank you.

1353
01:15:48,587 --> 01:15:50,110
Problem solved.

1354
01:15:59,903 --> 01:16:01,165
You nervous?

1355
01:16:01,731 --> 01:16:02,731
No.

1356
01:16:04,516 --> 01:16:06,125
Little nervous.
Maybe a little nervous.

1357
01:16:06,126 --> 01:16:07,474
Definitely a little bit nervous.

1358
01:16:07,475 --> 01:16:08,520
You got this.

1359
01:16:10,522 --> 01:16:12,958
So, we arranged a guest speaker

1360
01:16:12,959 --> 01:16:14,961
for you youngsters tonight.

1361
01:16:16,006 --> 01:16:17,484
Well, he's a minister.

1362
01:16:17,485 --> 01:16:20,488
He put it here on his coloring
book he made for you.

1363
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:23,622
His name is, uh, Greg Laurie.

1364
01:16:25,232 --> 01:16:26,538
- So, um...

1365
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:29,628
Come on up.

1366
01:16:33,763 --> 01:16:35,285
All right.
Hey, everyone. Ooh.

1367
01:16:35,286 --> 01:16:36,591
Oh, that's really bright.

1368
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:38,505
Um, thanks for comin' tonight.

1369
01:16:38,506 --> 01:16:39,942
Uh, thank you, father Malone

1370
01:16:39,943 --> 01:16:41,770
for that warm introduction.

1371
01:16:41,771 --> 01:16:43,902
My name is Greg Laurie,

1372
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:47,340
and I am totally sold out on
Jesus. Can you dig it?

1373
01:16:47,341 --> 01:16:48,472
Yeah.

1374
01:16:48,473 --> 01:16:49,691
Let's get right to it.

1375
01:16:49,692 --> 01:16:50,932
You got your bibles, everybody?

1376
01:16:51,128 --> 01:16:52,432
Yes!

1377
01:16:52,433 --> 01:16:53,738
All right, well, this is the
word of god.

1378
01:16:53,739 --> 01:16:56,350
This is life.
Let's open it together.

1379
01:17:11,801 --> 01:17:13,279
That was awesome!
Mmm-hmm.

1380
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:15,064
Right? It was totally awesome.

1381
01:17:15,065 --> 01:17:16,500
It was so good.

1382
01:17:16,501 --> 01:17:18,589
And they followed me.
It was like they got it.

1383
01:17:18,590 --> 01:17:19,851
- Yes.
- They got it. It was natural.

1384
01:17:19,852 --> 01:17:21,375
- It was so natural.
- Right?

1385
01:17:22,202 --> 01:17:23,681
Oh, my gosh!

1386
01:17:23,682 --> 01:17:25,292
- That was amazing!

1387
01:17:29,079 --> 01:17:30,297
I'm so proud of you.

1388
01:17:31,734 --> 01:17:33,648
Thank you.

How's your steak, dodie?

1423
01:19:47,086 --> 01:19:48,914
I think I wanna be a vegetarian.

1424
01:19:52,352 --> 01:19:54,354
So, Greg,

1425
01:19:56,748 --> 01:19:59,271
what are your plans
now that you graduated?

1426
01:19:59,272 --> 01:20:01,143
Dad.

1427
01:20:01,144 --> 01:20:04,450
I'm actually, uh, very
involved with the church

1428
01:20:04,451 --> 01:20:06,365
that cathe and I are going to.

1429
01:20:06,366 --> 01:20:09,325
Hmm. Yeah. Cathe told us
about the church.

1430
01:20:09,326 --> 01:20:12,416
- Yeah.
- And do they pay you
at, uh, at this church?

1431
01:20:13,721 --> 01:20:15,722
Do they, um... no.

1432
01:20:15,723 --> 01:20:18,160
No, they don't, as of now.

1433
01:20:18,161 --> 01:20:20,510
- It's more of a, um...
- He volunteers.

1434
01:20:20,511 --> 01:20:23,426
Yeah, yeah. It's more
of a volunteer situation.

1435
01:20:23,427 --> 01:20:25,384
But the, uh, the dream

1436
01:20:25,385 --> 01:20:27,996
is to actually start
my own church one day.

1437
01:20:27,997 --> 01:20:29,563
- Yeah, that's the dream.
Hmm.

1438
01:20:30,651 --> 01:20:32,044
We need more churches,
do we, Greg?

1439
01:20:33,567 --> 01:20:35,133
- How do you pay the rent?
- Dad.

1440
01:20:35,134 --> 01:20:36,831
Mom, can you please help?

1441
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:38,136
It's a fair question.

1442
01:20:38,137 --> 01:20:39,746
You should really
stay for dessert.

1443

They do blood samples

<i>Look, Mr. Martin,</i>

1446
01:20:44,665 --> 01:20:46,188
I know that you may not approve

1447
01:20:46,189 --> 01:20:48,495
of everything that cathe
and I are doing, but

1448
01:20:49,714 --> 01:20:50,932
I just think that it may be

1449
01:20:50,933 --> 01:20:52,368
because you don't
understand it really.

1450
01:20:52,369 --> 01:20:54,892
And what I want you
to know is that it's real.

1451
01:20:54,893 --> 01:20:56,067
It really is.

1452
01:20:56,068 --> 01:20:59,114
And I've got plans
for my life, sir.

1453
01:20:59,115 --> 01:21:02,857

the better, okay?

a ring or anything.

1614
01:31:50,635 --> 01:31:51,635
Great.

1615
01:31:53,508 --> 01:31:54,509
Well, um...

1616
01:31:55,335 --> 01:31:58,250
I just, uh, wanted to say

1617
01:31:58,251 --> 01:32:03,081
I am very much in favor

1618
01:32:03,082 --> 01:32:05,476
of a future together.

1619
01:32:08,784 --> 01:32:10,089
Yeah. And, uh...

1620
01:32:11,264 --> 01:32:12,265
Thank you.

1621
01:32:13,136 --> 01:32:14,224
You're welcome?

1622
01:32:18,054 --> 01:32:19,968
Hey, what's going on?

1623
01:32:19,969 --> 01:32:21,797
It's the same
old story, you know?

1624
01:32:22,449 --> 01:32:23,450
Mom was right.

1625
01:32:24,756 --> 01:32:25,757
Right about what?

1626
01:32:26,628 --> 01:32:27,628
Greg.

1627
01:32:28,194 --> 01:32:29,239
Look at me.

1628
01:32:29,848 --> 01:32:30,849
Right about what?

1629
01:32:31,981 --> 01:32:33,548
The fact that everyone leaves.

1630
01:32:35,419 --> 01:32:37,376
Eventually.

1631
01:32:37,377 --> 01:32:39,074
You think you found
something solid,

1632
01:32:39,075 --> 01:32:40,250
something firm,

1633
01:32:41,294 --> 01:32:43,253
it all just starts
to fall apart.

1634
01:32:44,341 --> 01:32:45,559
And that's what's
gonna happen to us

1635
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:47,082
because that is what
happens to everyone.

1636
01:32:47,083 --> 01:32:48,345
It's not. Listen.

1637
01:32:49,912 --> 01:32:51,782
I don't care what my dad says.

1638
01:32:51,783 --> 01:32:54,698
I don't care what your name is,
where you come from,

1639
01:32:54,699 --> 01:32:56,919
and how much money
you make, any of that.

1640
01:32:57,876 --> 01:32:59,530
You have a place
where you belong.

1641
01:33:01,750 --> 01:33:02,838
It's with me.

1642
01:33:03,665 --> 01:33:05,013
It's with us.

1643
01:33:05,014 --> 01:33:07,320
Haven't you learned
anything in the last year?

1644
01:33:08,104 --> 01:33:09,278
Greg.

1645
01:33:09,279 --> 01:33:10,540
I know that you think you mean that...

1646
01:33:10,541 --> 01:33:12,587
I do. I do mean that.

1647
01:33:16,242 --> 01:33:19,680
But I love you,
and I wanna be with you.

1648
01:33:19,681 --> 01:33:21,508
I don't think that you really

1649
01:33:23,119 --> 01:33:24,381
know what you want.

1650
01:33:26,513 --> 01:33:28,166
Maybe you're the one
who doesn't know what you want.

1651
01:33:28,167 --> 01:33:30,516
Well, obviously,
cath, look at us!

1652
01:33:30,517 --> 01:33:33,084
Yeah, look at us!
We're... we're arguing.

1653
01:33:33,085 --> 01:33:34,608
We're talking
about our feelings.

1654
01:33:34,609 --> 01:33:36,566
We're... we're working
through things.

1655
01:33:36,567 --> 01:33:39,352
It's called being
in a relationship, idiot.

1656
01:33:43,487 --> 01:33:44,488
What is...

1657
01:33:47,230 --> 01:33:48,623
What is wrong with you?

1658
01:33:51,147 --> 01:33:53,235
Why aren't you
fighting for this?

1659
01:33:53,236 --> 01:33:54,759
Come on, fight for me.

1660
01:33:59,590 --> 01:34:00,591
Wow.

1661
01:34:02,767 --> 01:34:05,422
You know,
you say that you're
looking for the truth.

1662
01:34:07,206 --> 01:34:10,122
I really just think you're
looking for an excuse
to be unhappy.

1663
01:34:12,516 --> 01:34:14,169
So go ahead.

1664
01:34:14,170 --> 01:34:15,650
Don't let me stand in your way.

1665
01:34:47,812 --> 01:34:50,249
Congrats, dad.
You win.

1666
01:34:51,076 --> 01:34:52,121
We broke up.

1667
01:34:59,694 --> 01:35:01,304
Cathe, I hope you know that...

1668
01:35:09,921 --> 01:35:11,357
I love you, mouse.

1669
01:35:13,751 --> 01:35:15,579
More than anything in the world.

1670
01:35:18,625 --> 01:35:20,497
I just don't wanna
see you get hurt.

1671
01:35:22,238 --> 01:35:24,631
I just wish
you could experience this.

1672
01:35:25,894 --> 01:35:28,547
Dad, it's not just for hippies.

1673
01:35:28,548 --> 01:35:30,550
It's so much bigger than that.

1674
01:35:41,736 --> 01:35:42,867
I love you too.

Everyone's waiting.

1680
01:36:15,595 --> 01:36:16,771
They're expecting Lonnie.

1681
01:36:18,947 --> 01:36:21,166
Chuck, this never
was about Lonnie

1682
01:36:22,254 --> 01:36:23,342
or you

1683
01:36:24,082 --> 01:36:25,605
or any one person.

1684
01:36:26,476 --> 01:36:27,564
He wasn't ready.

1685
01:36:28,652 --> 01:36:29,784
Maybe I wasn't ready.

1686
01:36:30,741 --> 01:36:31,960
I pushed him too hard.

1687
01:36:33,526 --> 01:36:35,746
I made a real mess
of things, Kay.

1688
01:36:37,269 --> 01:36:38,314
You ever think

1689
01:36:39,706 --> 01:36:42,318
maybe god chose
the wrong person?

1690
01:36:43,841 --> 01:36:44,929
Chuck,

1691
01:36:47,845 --> 01:36:49,847
listen to those people.

1692
01:36:51,806 --> 01:36:54,025
Feel the spirit in this place.

1693
01:36:56,201 --> 01:36:57,680
You think you're
important enough

1694
01:36:57,681 --> 01:36:59,204
to get in the way of that?

1695
01:37:02,860 --> 01:37:04,948
Don't be so arrogant
to think that god

1696
01:37:04,949 --> 01:37:06,908
can't work through
your failures.

1697
01:37:55,347 --> 01:37:56,608
Thought I'd say goodbye.

1698
01:37:56,609 --> 01:37:57,784
Yeah?

1699
01:37:58,742 --> 01:38:00,091
Seems to be going around.

1700
01:38:05,923 --> 01:38:07,445
Why aren't you in there?

1701
01:38:07,446 --> 01:38:09,013
I feel like worshipping alone.

1702
01:38:10,667 --> 01:38:13,322
I'm no expert, but I don't
think that's how this works.

1703
01:38:14,758 --> 01:38:15,845
You?

1704
01:38:15,846 --> 01:38:17,065
Headed back to New York.

1705
01:38:18,718 --> 01:38:21,939
You know, when they gave me
this story, I didn't want it.

1706
01:38:23,201 --> 01:38:24,898
Kind of thought
it was beneath me.

1707
01:38:24,899 --> 01:38:28,075
I cover wars
and riots and politics.

1708
01:38:28,076 --> 01:38:29,903
Important things.

1709
01:38:29,904 --> 01:38:32,210
Hippies and Jesus...

1710
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:36,822
Now, man, I don't know.

1711
01:38:36,823 --> 01:38:39,348
Our country is a dark
and divided place.

1712
01:38:40,001 --> 01:38:41,306
But in that tent,

1713
01:38:42,438 --> 01:38:44,395
there's hope.

1714
01:38:44,396 --> 01:38:48,704
And unity and miracles
that I can't even explain.

1715
01:38:48,705 --> 01:38:49,967
And it's spreading.

1716
01:38:50,925 --> 01:38:52,926
It's not just here.

1717
01:38:52,927 --> 01:38:55,885
Where, and how far,
I'm not sure yet.

1718
01:38:55,886 --> 01:38:57,540
That's what I'm gonna find out.

1719
01:38:59,368 --> 01:39:01,196
I don't know if any
of this is real.

1720
01:39:02,980 --> 01:39:04,547
I kind of hope it is,
to be honest.

1721
01:39:07,071 --> 01:39:08,943
And even if you
can't see it right now,

1722
01:39:10,466 --> 01:39:11,858
it's a family, man.

1723
01:39:13,382 --> 01:39:14,557
Don't give up on it.

1724
01:39:17,473 --> 01:39:18,604
It's my advice, anyway.

1725
01:39:20,606 --> 01:39:22,564
You take care of yourself, Greg.

1726
01:39:22,565 --> 01:39:23,696
Yeah, you too.

1727
01:39:25,742 --> 01:39:27,438
Uh, hey, who are you
writing this for?

1728
01:39:27,439 --> 01:39:29,180
Is this a book or newspaper?

1729
01:39:29,789 --> 01:39:30,921
A magazine.

1730
01:39:33,271 --> 01:39:34,271

It really is.

1758
01:41:58,677 --> 01:42:00,636

- Oh, I'm all right, babe.

1763
01:42:29,882 --> 01:42:32,928

I haven't been around a lot.

No, dad. Stop.

1765
01:42:35,888 --> 01:42:39,022
I have something
that I wanna say to you.

1766
01:42:44,549 --> 01:42:45,681
You see, um...

1767
01:42:47,552 --> 01:42:49,250
I was almost done with this

1768
01:42:50,120 --> 01:42:51,600
whole christianity thing.

1769
01:42:53,036 --> 01:42:54,211

01:43:11,185 --> 01:43:14,100
But then you did what nobody
else would even dare to do.

1776
01:43:15,972 --> 01:43:19,583
You let the hippies in.

1777
01:43:19,584 --> 01:43:22,370
Come to find out,
Jesus came in with them.

1778
01:43:24,807 --> 01:43:26,287
And you know what?

1779
01:43:27,636 --> 01:43:29,941
I'm proud of you.

1780
01:43:29,942 --> 01:43:32,380
You opened yourself up to
something you didn't understand.

1781
01:43:33,859 --> 01:43:35,947
And I'm changed because of it.

1782
01:43:35,948 --> 01:43:37,428
Thousands of us are.

1783
01:43:39,343 --> 01:43:42,867
But you don't have
to carry it all, okay?

1784
01:43:42,868 --> 01:43:44,522
Don't lose yourself
in all of it.

1785
01:43:45,001 --> 01:43:46,784
Okay.

1786
01:43:46,785 --> 01:43:49,527
Also, don't do drugs.

1787
01:44:06,370 --> 01:44:07,589
Thought I might find you here.

1788
01:44:09,678 --> 01:44:10,896
Do you mind?

1789
01:44:15,814 --> 01:44:18,642
So I recently heard
about this little church

1790
01:44:18,643 --> 01:44:20,165
up in riverside.

1791
01:44:20,166 --> 01:44:22,343
Pretty near that place
where you did that Bible study.

1792
01:44:24,258 --> 01:44:25,606
And it seems
that their leadership

1793
01:44:25,607 --> 01:44:27,695
had an issue about something

1794
01:44:27,696 --> 01:44:29,044
and ended splitting up.

1795
01:44:29,045 --> 01:44:31,133
They took everything.

1796
01:44:31,134 --> 01:44:34,268
They left an empty,
abandoned building

1797
01:44:35,399 --> 01:44:36,618
where a church used to be.

1798
01:44:38,750 --> 01:44:39,790
Seems a shame, doesn't it?

1799
01:44:42,319 --> 01:44:44,842
But that's what people do sometimes.

1800
01:44:44,843 --> 01:44:46,584
They lose sight
of what's important.

1801
01:44:48,760 --> 01:44:52,677
Fortunately, god has a long
history of using flawed people.

1802
01:44:54,505 --> 01:44:56,114
I'm sorry, son.

1803
01:44:56,115 --> 01:44:58,030
I didn't stand up for you
when I should have.

1804
01:44:59,118 --> 01:45:00,294
I was wrong for that.

1805
01:45:04,472 --> 01:45:05,472
Thank you.

1806
01:45:09,694 --> 01:45:13,437
So, what happened
to that church?

1807
01:45:15,047 --> 01:45:16,439
Oh, I bought it.

1808
01:45:16,440 --> 01:45:18,006
This morning.

1809
01:45:18,007 --> 01:45:19,704
It's like an empty canvas.

1810
01:45:21,053 --> 01:45:23,621
Seems perfect
for an artist like you.

1811
01:45:27,538 --> 01:45:31,454
You want me to work
there for you?

1812
01:45:31,455 --> 01:45:34,328
It's not my church.
It's yours.

1813
01:45:36,634 --> 01:45:38,679
This movement started
at calvary,

1814
01:45:38,680 --> 01:45:40,550
but it can't stay here.

1815
01:45:40,551 --> 01:45:43,946
So, go build something great.

1816
01:45:45,469 --> 01:45:46,557
I don't know what to say.

1817
01:45:47,515 --> 01:45:48,646
Say yes.

1818
01:45:51,475 --> 01:45:52,824
Yes.

1819
01:45:55,044 --> 01:45:56,306
Pastor Chuck...

1820
01:45:59,788 --> 01:46:01,745
I don't think I can ever
do what you do.

1821
01:46:01,746 --> 01:46:02,791
No.

1822
01:46:03,618 --> 01:46:04,836
You'll do better.

1823
01:46:10,712 --> 01:46:11,755
Hey, man.

1824
01:46:11,756 --> 01:46:13,191
Hey, sorry to bother you.

1825
01:46:13,192 --> 01:46:16,064
Is this the beach
where people get baptized?

1826
01:46:16,065 --> 01:46:18,110
Yeah. Yeah, it is.
Pirate's cove.

1827
01:46:18,502 --> 01:46:19,807
Cool.

1828
01:46:19,808 --> 01:46:21,156
My friends and I heard
about it on the radio

1829
01:46:21,157 --> 01:46:22,462
and drove all the way here.

1830
01:46:22,463 --> 01:46:23,551
Where from?

1831
01:46:24,073 --> 01:46:27,292
Texas.

1832
01:46:27,293 --> 01:46:31,733
We wanna get baptized
but didn't know how or when...

1833
01:46:33,212 --> 01:46:34,388
How about right now?

1834
01:46:54,756 --> 01:46:56,148
Amen. Amen.

1835
01:47:18,562 --> 01:47:20,215
Good evening, sir.

1836
01:47:20,216 --> 01:47:23,261
Um, I know that you don't
like me very much and...

1837
01:47:23,262 --> 01:47:24,568
She's in the dining room.

1838
01:47:25,961 --> 01:47:26,962
Oh.

1839
01:47:27,441 --> 01:47:28,442
Okay.

1840
01:47:30,095 --> 01:47:31,661
I didn't see that coming.

1841
01:47:31,662 --> 01:47:32,707
Go ahead, son.

1842
01:47:34,491 --> 01:47:35,840
Hey. Hi.

1843
01:47:36,493 --> 01:47:37,711
Hi, Greg.

1844
01:47:37,712 --> 01:47:39,669
Hi. Good evening.

1845
01:47:39,670 --> 01:47:41,324
Sorry to barge in so late...

1846
01:47:42,281 --> 01:47:44,369
I, uh...

1847
01:47:44,370 --> 01:47:46,546
I did not know how wet
I was until just right now.

1848
01:47:46,547 --> 01:47:47,895
And your hardwood floors.

1849
01:47:47,896 --> 01:47:49,157
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1850
01:47:49,158 --> 01:47:50,768
And you're not
wearing any shoes.

1851
01:47:52,596 --> 01:47:55,250
Yeah. Yeah, I'm not.
You're right about that.

1852
01:47:55,251 --> 01:47:58,079
But I just gotta tell you something.

1853
01:47:58,080 --> 01:47:59,734
I've been really stupid lately.

1854
01:48:01,300 --> 01:48:02,997
Obviously, you know that.

1855
01:48:02,998 --> 01:48:04,260
I'm sure you've heard.

1856
01:48:05,870 --> 01:48:08,655
I am so sorry
that I pushed you away.

1857
01:48:08,656 --> 01:48:09,874
And I hurt you.

1858
01:48:10,962 --> 01:48:12,094
It was so dumb.

1859
01:48:12,834 --> 01:48:14,008
It was really dumb.

1860
01:48:14,009 --> 01:48:16,401
- Really dumb.
- It really was.

1861
01:48:16,402 --> 01:48:17,751
The dumbest.

1862
01:48:17,752 --> 01:48:19,230
Yeah.

1863
01:48:19,231 --> 01:48:21,145
But I wanted to ask you

1864
01:48:21,146 --> 01:48:23,931
if you still mean
what you said the other day

1865
01:48:23,932 --> 01:48:25,063
about what you want

1866
01:48:26,282 --> 01:48:27,326
with us.

1867
01:48:29,633 --> 01:48:31,722
Because I got
really big plans, cathe.

1868
01:48:34,333 --> 01:48:36,422
Hopes and dreams.
I've got goals.

1869
01:48:39,251 --> 01:48:40,992
And I wanna do it with you.

1870
01:48:42,254 --> 01:48:43,385
Together.

1871
01:48:43,386 --> 01:48:44,430
You and I.

1872
01:48:46,824 --> 01:48:48,216
Because I get you.

1873
01:48:48,217 --> 01:48:49,696
I need you.

1874
01:48:49,697 --> 01:48:51,046
I want you.

1875
01:48:52,830 --> 01:48:53,917
And I...

1876
01:48:53,918 --> 01:48:54,963
"Love you"?

1877
01:48:57,487 --> 01:48:58,488
Yeah.

1878
01:48:59,794 --> 01:49:00,882
Like, a lot.

1879
01:49:02,492 --> 01:49:04,624
And so, what? What is this?

1880
01:49:04,625 --> 01:49:07,105
Is this your way
of proposing to me?

1881
01:49:07,541 --> 01:49:09,412
Oh. Um...

1882
01:49:10,631 --> 01:49:11,632
Um...

1883
01:49:13,372 --> 01:49:14,722
Uh...

1884
01:49:20,466 --> 01:49:22,163
What would you say if it was?

1885
01:49:22,164 --> 01:49:24,600
I would say...

1886
01:49:24,601 --> 01:49:28,648
That if you ever get
in the way of me and god

1887
01:49:28,649 --> 01:49:30,259
it's over between us.

1888
01:49:30,955 --> 01:49:32,087
So,

1889
01:49:33,349 --> 01:49:34,785
is that your way of saying yes?

1890
01:49:37,048 --> 01:49:38,049
Yes.

1891
01:49:49,452 --> 01:49:50,670
You're so wet.

1892
01:49:50,671 --> 01:49:51,846
I'm so wet.

He wrote a pretty nice article.

1905
01:50:36,760 --> 01:50:38,283
Seems the movement's everywhere.

1906
01:50:38,980 --> 01:50:39,980
Los Angeles.

1907
01:50:41,025 --> 01:50:42,026
Vegas.

1908
01:50:42,679 --> 01:50:44,332
Even in the south.

1909
01:50:44,333 --> 01:50:46,595
Alabama, Georgia, Florida.

1910
01:50:46,596 --> 01:50:48,728
- It's spreadin' like wildfire.

1911
01:50:48,729 --> 01:50:50,251
"Revolution." wow.

1912
01:50:50,252 --> 01:50:52,122
- I like that.
Me too.

1913
01:50:52,123 --> 01:50:54,168
You know, the first time
I saw Josiah,

1914
01:50:54,169 --> 01:50:55,517
he asked me if I thought this

1915
01:50:55,518 --> 01:50:57,737
was the beginning
of something or the end.

1916
01:50:57,738 --> 01:50:59,609
Feels to me like the beginning.

1917
01:51:02,830 --> 01:51:05,180
Let's see what god has in mind.

1918
01:51:14,276 --> 01:51:17,147
<i>The Jesus movement
is no longer a California fad.</i>

1919
01:51:17,148 --> 01:51:19,367
<i>It's a song-singing,
hand-clapping,</i>

1920
01:51:19,368 --> 01:51:21,586
<i>full-fledged,
old-fashioned revival</i>

1921
01:51:21,587 --> 01:51:23,327
<i>that's sweeping the country.</i>

1922
01:51:23,328 --> 01:51:25,895
<i>The converts are young people
who are turning to Christ</i>

1923
01:51:25,896 --> 01:51:27,810
<i>as their personal savior.</i>

1924
01:51:27,811 --> 01:51:29,507
<i>Their meetings,
for the most part,</i>

1925
01:51:29,508 --> 01:51:31,988
<i>are not inside
the established churches.</i>

1926
01:51:31,989 --> 01:51:33,381
<i>Jesus loves you.</i>

1927
01:51:33,382 --> 01:51:34,687
<i>Every last one of you.</i>

1928
01:51:34,688 --> 01:51:37,254
<i>I don't care what color you are,</i>

1929
01:51:37,255 --> 01:51:39,909
<i>he loves all of you
just the same.</i>

1930
01:51:39,910 --> 01:51:41,737
<i>More than
a quarter million youths</i>

1931
01:51:41,738 --> 01:51:43,739
<i>have converged on Dallas,</i>

1932
01:51:43,740 --> 01:51:47,700
<i>former hippies among them
now known as Jesus freaks.</i>

1933
01:51:47,701 --> 01:51:50,354
<i>We're told it could very well
be the largest</i>

1934
01:51:50,355 --> 01:51:53,662
<i>Christian youth gathering
in the history of america.</i>

1935
01:51:53,663 --> 01:51:55,708
<i>This is a Christian happening.</i>

1936
01:51:55,709 --> 01:51:58,101
