00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,574
~ <i>Hey lady</i> ~

3
00:00:45,702 --> 00:00:47,695
~ <i>You lady</i> ~

4
00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:50,617
~ <i>Cursing at your life</i> ~

5
00:00:50,749 --> 00:00:54,581
~ <i>You're a discontented mother</i> ~

6
00:00:54,711 --> 00:00:58,626
~ <i>And a regimented wife</i> ~

7
00:00:59,633 --> 00:01:03,002
~ <i>I've no doubt you dream about</i> ~

8
00:01:03,136 --> 00:01:06,303
~ <i>The things you 'll never do</i> ~

9
00:01:06,431 --> 00:01:09,966
~ <i>But I wish someone had've talked to me</i> ~

10
00:01:10,102 --> 00:01:13,518
~ <i>Like I wanna talk to you</i> ~

11
00:01:13,647 --> 00:01:18,273
~ <i>Ooh I've been to Georgia and California</i> ~

12
00:01:18,402 --> 00:01:21,901
~ <i>And anywhere I could run</i> ~

13
00:01:22,823 --> 00:01:26,571
~ <i>Took the hand of a preacher man and we</i> ~

14
00:01:26,702 --> 00:01:29,371
~ <i>Made love in the sun</i> ~

15
00:01:29,496 --> 00:01:34,075
~ <i>But I ran out of places and friendly faces</i> ~

16
00:01:34,209 --> 00:01:37,459
~ <i>Because I had to be free</i> ~

17
00:01:37,588 --> 00:01:46,094
~ <i>I've been to paradise</i>
<i>But I've never been to me</i> ~

18
00:01:48,558 --> 00:01:50,349
~ <i>Please lady</i> ~

19
00:01:50,476 --> 00:01:52,469
~ <i>Please lady</i> ~

20
00:01:52,604 --> 00:01:55,011
~ <i>Don't just walk away</i> ~

21
00:01:55,148 --> 00:02:03,737
~ <i>'Cause I have this need to tell you</i>
<i>Why I'm all alone today</i> ~

22
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:11,202
~ <i>I can see so much of me</i>
<i>Still living in your eyes</i> ~

23
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:15,375
~ <i>Won't you share a part of a weary heart</i> ~

24
00:02:15,501 --> 00:02:18,538
~ <i>That has lived a million lies</i> ~

25
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:23,167
~ <i>Oh I've been to Nice and the isles of Greece</i> ~

26
00:02:23,301 --> 00:02:27,215
~ <i>While I sipped champagne on a yacht</i> ~

27
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:34,061
~ <i>I moved like Harlow in Monte Carlo</i>
<i>And showed 'em what I got</i> ~

28
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:37,104
~ <i>I've been undressed by kings</i> ~

29
00:02:37,232 --> 00:02:42,937
~ <i>And I've seen some things</i>
<i>That a woman ain't supposed to see</i> ~

30
00:02:43,071 --> 00:02:49,954
~ <i>I've been to paradise</i> ~

31
00:02:50,538 --> 00:02:58,254
~ <i>But I've never been to me</i> ~

32
00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:07,379
~ <i>I've been to paradise</i> ~

33
00:03:07,513 --> 00:03:08,556
More!

34
00:03:09,014 --> 00:03:10,057
More!

35
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:17,513
Oh, please! Put it away!

36
00:03:24,947 --> 00:03:27,153
Are you OK?

37
00:03:29,618 --> 00:03:32,703
That was fucking charming,
you gutless pack of dickheads.

38
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,869
Fuck off, you talentless dog.

39
00:03:34,999 --> 00:03:37,122
- What was that?
- Show us your pink bits.

40
00:03:37,251 --> 00:03:40,951
No. Know why this mic
has such a long cord?

41
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:45,750
So it's easily retrieved
after I've shoved it up your arse.

42
00:03:52,976 --> 00:03:55,549
Christ almighty.

43
00:03:56,271 --> 00:03:59,058
What the fuck's going on out there tonight?

44
00:03:59,983 --> 00:04:02,355
Are you hurt?

45
00:04:02,485 --> 00:04:06,151
All right, which one of you bitches
sat on my dress?

46
00:04:06,281 --> 00:04:08,570
Tick, darling, it's for you.

47
00:04:09,826 --> 00:04:12,661
- Hello?
- Ding dong, Avon calling.

48
00:04:12,787 --> 00:04:15,539
Howdy, sunshine. Long time no hear.

49
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:19,415
- Where?
- Emergency Ward A.

50
00:04:23,089 --> 00:04:25,383
Mr Belrose?

51
00:04:26,009 --> 00:04:27,052
Yes?

52
00:04:29,763 --> 00:04:32,336
So, how about it?

53
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,813
Get off him!

54
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:48,438
Taxi! Taxi!

55
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,543
Yeah?

56
00:04:59,252 --> 00:05:01,956
Bernadette? It's Tick.

57
00:05:02,088 --> 00:05:06,714
Sorry to call you so late but I...
Hey, are you OK?

58
00:05:07,593 --> 00:05:09,550
No, I'm not.

59
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:11,802
What's the matter?

60
00:05:11,931 --> 00:05:14,469
Trumpet just died.

61
00:05:24,485 --> 00:05:27,984
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.

62
00:05:28,114 --> 00:05:30,865
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.

63
00:05:30,992 --> 00:05:33,779
He leadeth me beside the still waters.

64
00:05:33,911 --> 00:05:35,571
He restoreth my soul,

65
00:05:35,705 --> 00:05:39,287
He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness
for His name's sake.

66
00:05:39,417 --> 00:05:44,126
Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.

67
00:05:44,255 --> 00:05:48,335
For Thou art with me.
Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me.

68
00:05:48,467 --> 00:05:52,513
Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies.

69
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,471
Thou anointest my head with oil.
My cup runneth over.

70
00:05:56,602 --> 00:06:00,765
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
all the days of my life

71
00:06:00,898 --> 00:06:04,942
and I will dwell in the House of the Lord forever.

72
00:06:05,861 --> 00:06:07,569
It's not fair.

73
00:06:07,696 --> 00:06:12,939
I spent half my life and all my savings
trying to snag a sympathetic husband

74
00:06:13,076 --> 00:06:16,576
and the selfish little shit goes and dies on me.

75
00:06:16,705 --> 00:06:21,166
25 years old
and he goes and slips over in a bathroom.

76
00:06:21,293 --> 00:06:23,167
He didn't slip.

77
00:06:23,295 --> 00:06:28,420
He was peroxiding his hair at home again
and he asphyxiated on the fumes.

78
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:32,216
I've got to get some space.

79
00:06:32,346 --> 00:06:36,390
- I've been asked to do a show out of town.
- That's nice.

80
00:06:36,517 --> 00:06:41,759
Why don't you come with me? I'll need help
and we could both use the break.

81
00:06:41,897 --> 00:06:44,388
You're not wrong. Where is it?

82
00:06:44,525 --> 00:06:46,601
Alice Springs.

83
00:06:46,735 --> 00:06:49,440
You've got to be fucking joking.

84
00:06:50,072 --> 00:06:52,030
Wo-Man is a...

85
00:06:53,076 --> 00:06:56,943
...unique range of speciality facial products

86
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,156
designed for the more...

87
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,290
...heavy-duty woman in us all.

88
00:07:06,548 --> 00:07:08,042
Excuse me.

89
00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:10,588
Hello?

90
00:07:10,718 --> 00:07:12,592
How long is the run?

91
00:07:13,805 --> 00:07:15,216
Four weeks.

92
00:07:15,348 --> 00:07:18,799
Equity minimum, two shows a night,
accommodation included.

93
00:07:20,812 --> 00:07:23,896
I can't just sit around here crying all the time.

94
00:07:24,023 --> 00:07:28,816
Jesus. My mascara keeps running.
I look like a racoon.

95
00:07:28,945 --> 00:07:31,614
Good girl, that's the spirit.

96
00:07:31,739 --> 00:07:36,401
Here's hoping the desert's
big enough for the two of us.

97
00:07:36,536 --> 00:07:37,816
Three of us.

98
00:07:37,954 --> 00:07:41,370
~ <i>A desert holiday</i>
<i>Let's pack the drag away</i> ~

99
00:07:41,499 --> 00:07:45,034
~ <i>You take the lunch and tea</i>
<i>I'll take the ecstasy</i> ~

100
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:48,752
~ <i>Fuck off, you silly queer</i>
<i>I'm getting out of here</i> ~

101
00:07:48,882 --> 00:07:52,381
~ <i>A desert holiday</i>
<i>Hip, hip, hip, hip hooray</i> ~

102
00:07:56,182 --> 00:07:57,224
Why?

103
00:07:57,975 --> 00:08:02,436
Why not? Look, he's turned into
a bloody good little performer.

104
00:08:02,563 --> 00:08:07,770
Right. A bloody good little performer.
24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

105
00:08:07,902 --> 00:08:13,904
- I thought we were getting away from this shit.
- Two's company, three's a party, my sweet.

106
00:08:14,033 --> 00:08:18,030
We're unplugging our curling wands
and going bush, Felicia.

107
00:08:18,162 --> 00:08:22,325
Why would you leave all this
to hike into the middle of nowhere?

108
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:25,293
- Do you really want to know?
- Desperately.

109
00:08:26,462 --> 00:08:30,210
Well, ever since I was a lad, I've had this dream,

110
00:08:30,341 --> 00:08:34,006
a dream that I finally have a chance to fulfil.

111
00:08:34,136 --> 00:08:35,963
And that is?

112
00:08:36,096 --> 00:08:41,173
To travel to the centre of Australia,
climb Kings Canyon as a queen,

113
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:45,308
in a full-length Gaultier sequin,
heels and a tiara.

114
00:08:46,774 --> 00:08:48,025
Great.

115
00:08:48,609 --> 00:08:53,318
Just what this country needs.
A cock in a frock on a rock.

116
00:08:53,447 --> 00:08:56,734
Get back in your kennels, both of you.

117
00:08:56,868 --> 00:09:02,289
The first thing we have to work out...
is how the hell we're gonna get there.

118
00:09:16,263 --> 00:09:17,514
Ta-da!

119
00:09:18,014 --> 00:09:22,511
- What do you think?
- When do we return it to the school?

120
00:09:22,644 --> 00:09:24,720
We don't. We own it.

121
00:09:26,022 --> 00:09:27,065
What?

122
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:32,650
I met some nice Swedish tourists
called Lars, Lars and Lars,

123
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:35,733
and coaxed it out of them for 10,000 bucks.

124
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:38,107
- We can't afford it.
- Well, that's right.

125
00:09:38,994 --> 00:09:41,200
"Mummy, maybe a trip to the outback

126
00:09:41,329 --> 00:09:44,829
would help me get over
this little phase I'm going through.

127
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:48,493
And you never know,
I might meet some lovely country girl."

128
00:09:49,421 --> 00:09:53,288
I hereby christen this budget barbie camper:

129
00:09:53,425 --> 00:09:55,880
Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.

130
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,179
The understatement of the century.

131
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:10,026
~ <i>Yeah</i> ~

132
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:16,611
~ <i>Together we will go away</i> ~

133
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:20,441
~ <i>Together we will leave some day</i> ~

134
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:21,621
~ <i>Together</i> ~

135
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:22,788
Mum!

136
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:29,711
Ladies and gentlemen,

137
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:33,087
we're here to see off a very brave woman

138
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:36,216
who will attempt to cross a continent alone.

139
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:39,629
On behalf of all our sponsors, we'd like...

140
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:46,594
~ <i>Go west life is peaceful there</i> ~

141
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:50,347
~ <i>Go west in the open air</i> ~

142
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,900
Ladies, start your engines.

143
00:10:57,031 --> 00:11:01,279
~ <i>Go west sun in wintertime</i> ~

144
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:05,492
~ <i>Go west we will do just fine</i> ~

145
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:09,159
~ <i>Go west where the skies are blue</i> ~

146
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:13,209
~ <i>Go west this and more we'll do</i> ~

147
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:17,005
~ <i>Together we will love the beach</i> ~

148
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:20,801
~ <i>Together we will learn and teach</i> ~

149
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:24,430
~ <i>Together change our pace of life</i> ~

150
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,807
~ <i>Together we will work and strive</i> ~

151
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:32,853
~ <i>This old man, he played two</i>
<i>He played nick-nack with my poo</i> ~

152
00:11:32,985 --> 00:11:34,728
~ <i>With a nick-nack paddy-whack...</i> ~

153
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:37,649
Oh, please. Give me a break.

154
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:41,568
~ <i>Four fat trannies working on the wall</i> ~

155
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:45,699
~ <i>And if one fat tranny should accidentally fall</i> ~

156
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:49,875
~ <i>Oh my darling Clementine,</i> ~

157
00:11:55,048 --> 00:12:00,423
- How long have we been on the road?
- Four and a half hours.

158
00:12:02,056 --> 00:12:04,761
I've got a splitting headache already.

159
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,937
- Happy hour.
- Mother's ruin <i>pour moi</i>

160
00:12:10,064 --> 00:12:13,564
- Long Island tea
- And a Stoli and tonic for me

161
00:12:16,696 --> 00:12:19,317
- Stupid cow.
- Well, listen to this.

162
00:12:19,449 --> 00:12:24,194
After we did the ABBA show,
Kevin had a liposuction penis enlargement.

163
00:12:24,329 --> 00:12:27,199
- He didn't.
- Yep. Do you know what they do?

164
00:12:27,332 --> 00:12:31,994
They siphon the fat from your love handles
and inject it into your wing wang.

165
00:12:32,128 --> 00:12:33,622
Yucky tuu!

166
00:12:33,755 --> 00:12:37,835
I suppose it gives a whole new meaning
to "cracking a fat" though.

167
00:12:39,636 --> 00:12:44,511
Oh, listen to yourselves.
You sound like two fat slags at a pie bake-off.

168
00:12:44,641 --> 00:12:49,468
Well, your contribution to the conversation
hasn't exactly made headlines, Bernice.

169
00:12:49,604 --> 00:12:52,225
Gee, poor Kevin 's dick.

170
00:12:52,357 --> 00:12:57,434
Can't be much room down there,
with his brain taking up so much space already.

171
00:12:58,488 --> 00:13:01,194
No, I'll join this conversation on the proviso

172
00:13:01,325 --> 00:13:03,448
that we stop bitching about people,

173
00:13:03,577 --> 00:13:06,946
talking about wigs, dresses, bust sizes,

174
00:13:07,081 --> 00:13:09,951
penises, drugs, nightclubs, and bloody ABBA.

175
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:13,915
Doesn't give us much to talk about, then.

176
00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:20,427
Hey, can you confirm a rumour?
Is it true that her real name's Ralph?

177
00:13:26,016 --> 00:13:29,053
How d'you like your little boys, girls?

178
00:13:32,147 --> 00:13:35,018
You don't have to answer that.

179
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,693
Oh, my God.

180
00:13:36,819 --> 00:13:39,226
What is this? <i>Outback With Benny Hill</i>?

181
00:13:39,363 --> 00:13:41,984
Just leave mine outside at 8 a.m.

182
00:13:42,116 --> 00:13:45,070
Along with an orange juice and toast, please.

183
00:13:45,202 --> 00:13:47,159
Why, certainly, madam.

184
00:13:47,288 --> 00:13:50,538
And would you like Vegemite or jam with that?

185
00:13:53,961 --> 00:13:56,037
Knock, knock, room service.

186
00:13:56,171 --> 00:14:00,086
Can't you read the sign?
"Do not disturb. Come back in the morning."

187
00:14:00,217 --> 00:14:02,792
Ha, ha. Open the door.

188
00:14:02,929 --> 00:14:06,844
- Good night, Bernice.
- Good night, Mitzi.

189
00:14:06,975 --> 00:14:09,264
Open the fucking door!

190
00:14:12,355 --> 00:14:16,435
OK, if you don't open the door, I'm gonna sing.

191
00:14:18,737 --> 00:14:20,813
Fine. You asked for it.

192
00:14:22,574 --> 00:14:25,758
~ <i>I don't care if the sun don't shine</i>

~ <i>Don't ask how many times...</i> ~
- Night, John -boy.

199
00:14:53,104 --> 00:14:55,180
I'm seriously falling asleep.

200
00:14:55,315 --> 00:14:58,399
It's your shift and you're gonna stick to it.

201
00:14:58,527 --> 00:15:01,196
Serves you right for staying out all night, slut.

202
00:15:01,321 --> 00:15:03,398
Well, I'm not gonna make it.

203
00:15:03,533 --> 00:15:07,945
~ <i>I don't care if the sun don't shine</i> ~
- Oh, fuck off, grandma.

204
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,071
You all right?

205
00:15:10,206 --> 00:15:13,041
Me? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just thinking.

206

00:15:45,867 --> 00:15:47,118
Sorry.

215
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:48,953
Shit.

216
00:15:50,204 --> 00:15:52,280
What is it?

217
00:16:06,638 --> 00:16:09,556
Perhaps we should have flown.

218
00:16:27,326 --> 00:16:29,781
Wrong. But thanks for playing. Anyone else?

219
00:16:29,912 --> 00:16:32,996
- No.
- Witchetty grub, your turn.

220
00:16:33,123 --> 00:16:37,251
I spy with my little eye,
something beginning with R.

221
00:16:37,377 --> 00:16:39,453
- Rectum.
- No.

222
00:16:39,588 --> 00:16:41,664
- Ring pirate.
- No.

223
00:16:41,798 --> 00:16:42,841
Road?

224
00:16:43,508 --> 00:16:46,675
- All right, that's it. What's the matter?
- Nothing, darling.

225
00:16:46,803 --> 00:16:50,422
Don't "darling" me, darling.
You've got a face like a cat's arse.

226
00:16:50,557 --> 00:16:54,258
- Come on, 'fess up.
- Just worried about the show, that's all.

227
00:16:54,394 --> 00:16:56,601
We haven't done any rehearsals yet.

228
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:01,273
We've got two weeks to rehearse,
for Christ's sake. Now, what is your problem?

229
00:17:01,401 --> 00:17:05,945
It's not a problem.
I just want this show to be good, that's all.

230
00:17:06,074 --> 00:17:08,529
How the fuck did you get this job?

231
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:13,322
Who is the fish that runs this hotel
in the middle of nowhere? Your mother?

232
00:17:13,456 --> 00:17:15,532
No, my wife.

233
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:19,415
Don't tell me you've got an ex-boyfriend
tucked away somewhere.

234
00:17:19,546 --> 00:17:21,622
No, my wife.

235
00:17:22,757 --> 00:17:24,168
I'm married.

236
00:17:34,102 --> 00:17:40,983
And when the joint bank account ran dry
after a couple of years,

237
00:17:41,109 --> 00:17:48,274
I guess I preferred her wedding ring to mine,
so no drama, we swapped and called it a day.

238
00:17:48,408 --> 00:17:50,484
This is getting too weird.

239
00:17:51,661 --> 00:17:53,819
You and a woman?

240
00:17:55,248 --> 00:18:01,002
What did she do for kicks? Put a bucket
on your head and swing off the handle?

241
00:18:01,129 --> 00:18:05,340
There are two things
I don't like about you, Felicia: Your face.

242
00:18:05,466 --> 00:18:07,958
So how about shutting both of them?

243
00:18:08,095 --> 00:18:11,215
At least this explains
your abysmal batting average.

244
00:18:11,348 --> 00:18:17,885
I often wondered why your dance card
was so empty. I take it you never got a divorce?

245
00:18:19,023 --> 00:18:21,478
Well, girls, what can I say?

246
00:18:21,609 --> 00:18:23,981
Here's to a secret very well kept.

247
00:18:24,111 --> 00:18:27,729
Shame it's not going to stay that way.

248
00:18:27,865 --> 00:18:30,949
Got any more little surprises
you'd like to share?

249
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:35,655
Haven't got any kids
stashed away out there as well, have you?

250
00:18:39,293 --> 00:18:43,041
Look, I haven't lied about anything.

251
00:18:45,049 --> 00:18:48,631
After six years I suddenly get a call
screaming for help,

252
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:52,212
and Christ knows, I owe her a couple of favours.

253
00:18:55,226 --> 00:18:57,847
I'm sorry that I never told you.

254
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:01,809
I'm not sorry that you're here.

255
00:19:08,573 --> 00:19:11,527
Don't worry about it, dolls.

256
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:14,151
I'm as jealous as all hell.

257
00:19:25,048 --> 00:19:26,091
What?

258
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:31,546
So, was it a big wedding?
Get lots of pressies, did you?

259
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:35,629
- I wish I was old enough to have been there.
- Oh, ha ha.

260
00:19:35,767 --> 00:19:40,096
I would have bought you
lovely hers and hers bath mats or something.

261
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,558
Give it a rest.

262
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:48,404
Not on your life. Oh, imagine,
Mitzi the Magnificent and her blushing bride.

263
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:51,484
Mowing those lawns
must've been murder on your heels.

264
00:19:51,616 --> 00:19:53,988
All right, Felicia, that's enough.

265
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:57,155
Let's put some money
in that seething cesspool mouth.

266
00:19:57,289 --> 00:20:02,579
If I win this game, you will never mention my wife
ever in my presence again.

267
00:20:02,711 --> 00:20:06,293
- And if I win?
- Name your price.

268
00:20:06,423 --> 00:20:12,260
Well, now, what would I like more than
anything else in the whole wide world?

269
00:20:12,388 --> 00:20:14,961
Snap. Better be quick.

270
00:20:17,643 --> 00:20:21,344

274
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:34,692
What the fuck am I doing?

275
00:20:34,827 --> 00:20:38,161
Take that bloody frock off, Felicia.
Don't make it worse.

276
00:20:38,289 --> 00:20:42,702
You think I'm gonna let you
walk away with all the attention? No chance.

277
00:20:42,835 --> 00:20:45,373
Come on, girls, let's go shopping.

278
00:20:46,255 --> 00:20:48,047
Oh, for Christ's sake.

279
00:20:48,174 --> 00:20:50,250
~ <i>I love the nightlife</i> ~

280
00:20:50,384 --> 00:20:57,098
~ <i>I got to boogie on the disco'round yeah</i> ~

281
00:20:58,351 --> 00:20:59,596
What's that?

282
00:21:05,983 --> 00:21:08,309
Oh, I just adore these hats.

283
00:21:09,195 --> 00:21:10,863
Come on.

284
00:21:11,155 --> 00:21:13,232
~ <i>Please don't talk about love tonight</i> ~

285

286

288
00:21:29,841 --> 00:21:32,546
You've got to be kidding.

289
00:21:32,678 --> 00:21:37,174
Welcome to the Mario Palace. Come in.
Come in.

290
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:43,517
Come in. What can I do for you?
Would you like a room, madam?

291
00:21:57,536 --> 00:21:58,996
Subtle.

292
00:21:59,454 --> 00:22:02,740
Tackarama.
Who the hell does the painting around here?

293
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:06,659
Someone with no arms or right foot,
by the look of things.

294
00:22:06,795 --> 00:22:11,790
For goodness' sakes, get down off that crucifix.
Someone needs the wood.

295
00:22:11,925 --> 00:22:14,678
What have we here?

296
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,761
What fun. Baby bottles of booze.

297
00:22:19,893 --> 00:22:20,935
Oh.

298
00:22:21,769 --> 00:22:25,269
Gather round, girls. Let me show you a trick.

299
00:22:25,398 --> 00:22:27,521
You drink the gin...

300
00:22:33,573 --> 00:22:36,894
...fill it with water and
put it back in the fridge.

301
00:22:36,998 --> 00:22:38,938
<i>- Va t'en vous.</i> And Scotch?

302
00:22:39,042 --> 00:22:42,446
Ah, that's where
the complimentary teabags come in handy.

303
00:22:42,582 --> 00:22:44,658
- Very clever.
- Cheers, girls.

304
00:22:44,792 --> 00:22:47,330
And congratulations, Mitzi darling, you did it.

305
00:22:47,462 --> 00:22:50,913
One lap of the Broken Hill main drag in drag.

306
00:22:51,049 --> 00:22:54,465
That'll teach you to take on
the Fairmont Boys snap champion.

307
00:22:54,594 --> 00:22:58,426
Here's to being off the fucking bus.

308
00:22:58,556 --> 00:22:59,635
- Chookers.
- Chookers.

309
00:22:59,766 --> 00:23:01,343
Chookers.

310
00:23:03,937 --> 00:23:07,388
So, all dolled up and nowhere to go.

311
00:23:07,524 --> 00:23:10,643
I sure as shit am not sitting here all evening.

312
00:23:10,777 --> 00:23:12,237
I'm in.

313
00:23:16,116 --> 00:23:20,577
Oh, all right.
Here's hoping they have a decent cocktail bar.

314
00:23:41,141 --> 00:23:42,393
Hello.

315
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,895
Could I please have a Stoli and tonic,

316
00:23:46,021 --> 00:23:49,058
a Bloody Mary, and a lime daiquiri, please?

317
00:23:50,025 --> 00:23:51,485
Well...

318
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:55,320
...look what the cat dragged in.

319
00:23:57,366 --> 00:24:02,870
What have we got here, eh?
A couple of show girls, have we?

320
00:24:04,707 --> 00:24:07,873
Where did you ladies come in from? Uranus?

321
00:24:10,254 --> 00:24:14,038
- Could I please have a St...
- No, you can't have.

322
00:24:14,174 --> 00:24:18,304
You can't have nothing.
There's nothing here for people like you.

323
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:20,098
Nothing.

324
00:24:29,941 --> 00:24:32,349
Now, listen here, you mullet.

325
00:24:32,485 --> 00:24:36,269
Why don't you just light your tampon
and blow your box apart?

326
00:24:36,406 --> 00:24:41,115
Because it's the only bang
you're ever gonna get, sweetheart.

327
00:25:00,263 --> 00:25:05,602
~ <i>... When I'm with my baby</i> ~

328
00:25:07,562 --> 00:25:11,311
Now, what could be more soothing

329
00:25:11,441 --> 00:25:16,899
than coming home
after a hard day's work down the mine

330
00:25:17,031 --> 00:25:20,732
to the Wo-Man in us all?

331
00:25:20,868 --> 00:25:24,403
Now, don't send any money, OK?

332
00:26:12,086 --> 00:26:13,129
Shit.

333
00:26:14,255 --> 00:26:18,170
All I can see is female impersonators.

334
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:30,142
This has gotta be a first.
Nobody's ever outdrunk old Shirl before.

335
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:34,222
- Where'd you learn to do that?
- That's our girl, Bernadette.

336
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:40,445
I knew stumbling round pubs with Les Girls
for 200 years must have taught her something.

337
00:26:40,574 --> 00:26:42,697
You're a bloody marvel, Bernie.

338
00:26:42,826 --> 00:26:44,902
- Bernadette, please.
- What's that?

339
00:26:45,037 --> 00:26:49,200
- My name isn't Bernie.
- She said her name isn't Bernie.

340
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:52,451
It's Ralph.

341
00:26:56,298 --> 00:26:57,966
Come on.

342
00:27:03,305 --> 00:27:05,381
What did you call me?

343
00:27:05,515 --> 00:27:10,343
- What did you call me, what?
- What did you call me in the bar?

344
00:27:10,479 --> 00:27:12,436
Sorry, Ralph.

345
00:27:14,441 --> 00:27:16,434
You fucking idiot.

346
00:27:18,445 --> 00:27:19,488
Fuck.

347
00:27:21,658 --> 00:27:24,493
Get off me, you fucking... Fuck!

348
00:27:25,286 --> 00:27:27,991
Fucking thing. It's only my fucking head.

349
00:27:28,122 --> 00:27:32,416
- At least that bump's bigger than your prick.
- Get fucked, you stupid old bitch.

350
00:27:32,544 --> 00:27:34,832
Oh, piss off, you little faggot.

351
00:27:36,339 --> 00:27:39,957
If your mouth was as big as your dick
you wouldn't...

352
00:27:59,112 --> 00:28:01,235
- Good morning.
- Morning.

353
00:28:03,324 --> 00:28:05,151
It's funny, you know.

354
00:28:06,369 --> 00:28:09,820
No matter how tough I think I'm getting...

355
00:28:12,083 --> 00:28:14,123
...it still hurts.

356
00:28:17,213 --> 00:28:20,831
Hope it still works.
Not much call for it out here.

357
00:28:20,968 --> 00:28:23,922
- Where you blokes from?
- Uranus.

358
00:28:24,054 --> 00:28:25,931
Oh, good.

359
00:28:28,642 --> 00:28:33,103
~ <i>Fish gotta swim birds gotta fly</i> ~

360
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:36,017
~ <i>I got to love one man till I die</i> ~

361
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,692
There, left.

362
00:28:37,818 --> 00:28:40,392
Hope you know what you'r doing.

363
00:28:40,529 --> 00:28:45,736
If we stick to the sealed road,
we'll be at it at least another two days.

364
00:28:47,745 --> 00:28:49,654
Take the short cut.

365
00:28:49,788 --> 00:28:53,537
~ <i>Tell me I'm crazy maybe I know</i> ~

366

378

I'll smack his face so hard, he'll have to stick
his toothbrush up his arse to clean his teeth.

379
00:29:53,562 --> 00:30:00,359
- Just lay off. I told you not to use the R word.
- I was only having fun.

380
00:30:00,485 --> 00:30:05,728
Fun? What else do you do for amusement?
Slam your fingers in car doors?

381
00:30:05,866 --> 00:30:08,902
I like seeing people get hotheaded.
Gives me a kick.

382
00:30:09,035 --> 00:30:13,781
Is it true when you were born
the doctor slapped your mother?

383
00:30:13,957 --> 00:30:17,160
What sort of bent childhood did you have,
Adam Whitely?

384
00:30:17,294 --> 00:30:18,336
Adam.

385
00:30:19,713 --> 00:30:20,755
Adam.

386
00:30:23,676 --> 00:30:25,550
Come in here, boy.

387
00:30:27,013 --> 00:30:29,136
Come and sit over here.

388
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:35,426
Would you like to have some fun
with Uncle Barry?

389
00:30:35,563 --> 00:30:39,810
We're gonna play a special game
but you can't tell anybody,

390
00:30:39,942 --> 00:30:44,106
ever, ever, ever, OK?

391
00:30:44,238 --> 00:30:47,856
What I want you to do
is put your hand down here

392
00:30:47,992 --> 00:30:50,234
and pull very gently, OK?

393
00:30:51,829 --> 00:30:53,905
Very gently.

394
00:30:57,293 --> 00:30:59,665
That's good. That's good.

395
00:31:02,965 --> 00:31:05,421
Jesus Christ, Adam. Get it off.

396
00:31:05,968 --> 00:31:10,714
Adam, Uncle Barry's ping pongs
are caught in the drain. Get Mummy.

397
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:12,757
- Get Mummy.
- No.

398
00:31:12,892 --> 00:31:15,015
What do you mean, no?

399
00:31:15,144 --> 00:31:17,433
Never, ever, ever, ever.

400
00:31:20,524 --> 00:31:22,601
You know the best part?

401
00:31:22,735 --> 00:31:28,655
Mum was out playing golf and the dirty old fuck
was stuck there for seven hours.

402
00:31:28,784 --> 00:31:32,698
I thought they were small and wrinkled
before they got in the water.

403
00:31:42,089 --> 00:31:45,921
Hey, I've got a joke. Who wants to hear a joke?

404
00:31:47,302 --> 00:31:51,881
Bernice, it's so funny, you'll laugh so hard
your lashes will curl themselves.

405
00:31:52,015 --> 00:31:55,634
- Do tell us your hilarious joke.
- OK.

406
00:31:55,769 --> 00:31:59,220
Well, once upon a time, many moons ago,

407
00:31:59,356 --> 00:32:02,939
there was a famous bunch of Indians
called the Fukawie Tribe.

408
00:32:03,068 --> 00:32:07,148
One day,
the son of the great chief asks his father,

409
00:32:07,281 --> 00:32:11,029
"Dad, why's my friend Little Hawk
called Little Hawk?"

410
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:15,703
- And his father says...
- "Why d'you ask, Two Dogs Fucking?"

411
00:32:15,831 --> 00:32:18,120
That's not the end of the joke.

412
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:20,705
So, anyway, back to me.

413
00:32:22,629 --> 00:32:24,373
- Jesus.
- What's happening?

414
00:32:24,506 --> 00:32:26,464
I don't know.

415
00:32:41,441 --> 00:32:43,599
Oh, my God.

416
00:33:01,669 --> 00:33:05,881
Oh, Felicia.
Where the fuck are we?

417
00:33:15,808 --> 00:33:18,975
Shit! Shit! Shit!

418
00:33:34,995 --> 00:33:36,872
Oh, shit.

419
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:44,958
I've had a look around,
and we can safely assume

420
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:50,759
that I now know less about motors
than when I first lifted up that bonnety thing.

421
00:33:50,886 --> 00:33:52,763
Now what?

422
00:33:53,222 --> 00:33:56,258
Let's not think about it and eat brekkie.

423
00:33:56,392 --> 00:34:00,176
Oh, that's a novel idea.
Let's stuff ourselves to death.

424
00:34:00,312 --> 00:34:02,221
Imagine the headlines:

425
00:34:02,356 --> 00:34:08,525
"Whales beach themselves in the outback.
Mystery boomsticks dead in drag."

426
00:34:08,654 --> 00:34:13,446
No point walking back. The only life for
the last million miles were hypnotised bunnies,

427
00:34:13,576 --> 00:34:15,402
and they're wedged in the tyres.

428
00:34:15,536 --> 00:34:18,987
Somebody'll drive past for sure.
We'll keep the fire burning.

429
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:22,539
Yes, and toast marshmallows
and chill champagne for when they arrive.

430
00:34:22,668 --> 00:34:24,542
What if they don't drive past?

431
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:27,671
Look, you're not helping here.
Just eat your hormones.

432
00:34:27,798 --> 00:34:30,634
Hell. Why didn't we stick to the main road?

433
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:34,592
- What difference does it make now?
- You got us into this, Anthony Belrose,

434
00:34:34,723 --> 00:34:37,178
and I suggest you get us back

435
00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:42,683
or I don't fancy your chances
of ever trying to be a husband again.

436
00:34:44,983 --> 00:34:47,652
Jesus. What are we gonna do?

437
00:34:47,777 --> 00:34:53,697
We're gonna start with a face-lift. Nothing like
a new frock to brighten up your day.

438
00:34:56,703 --> 00:34:58,162
Purple?

439
00:34:58,288 --> 00:35:00,530
It's not purple. It's lavender.

440
00:35:01,416 --> 00:35:06,374
- What do you think?
- It's nice. In a hideous sort of a way.

441
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:09,130
Where are you going?

442
00:35:09,257 --> 00:35:14,085
If you think I'm going to sit around
watching Picasso take on public transport,

443
00:35:14,221 --> 00:35:19,381
you've got another think coming.
I'll be back with the cavalry in a few hours.

444
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:23,183
There goes a transsexual,
last seen heading south.

445
00:35:23,313 --> 00:35:27,227
- We called her Bernie but her real name was...
- Adam!

446
00:36:16,659 --> 00:36:18,119
Coo-ee!

447
00:36:19,537 --> 00:36:20,997
Coo-ee!

448
00:38:22,537 --> 00:38:24,743
Help. Help.

449
00:38:26,624 --> 00:38:27,953
- What's that, Pa?
- What?

450
00:38:28,084 --> 00:38:31,370
That there. Looks like a woman.

451
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,423
Help!

452
00:38:37,177 --> 00:38:39,087
Thank God.

453
00:38:45,185 --> 00:38:46,977
Thank you.

454
00:38:47,104 --> 00:38:50,188
I can't tell you how grateful I am.

455
00:38:52,192 --> 00:38:58,029
~ <i>I just walked in to find you here with</i>
<i>That sad look upon your face, I should have...</i> ~

456
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:09,826
You fucking beauty.

457
00:39:18,594 --> 00:39:23,055
- Oh, shit.
- I never thought I'd be so glad to see you.

458
00:39:23,182 --> 00:39:27,262
- I wish I could say the same.
- I was drawing up the will.

459
00:39:27,394 --> 00:39:30,099
Come and meet our saviours.

460
00:39:31,523 --> 00:39:34,359
Tony, Adam, this is Mr and Mrs Spencer.

461
00:39:34,485 --> 00:39:36,395
- Hello.
- Hello.

462
00:39:39,074 --> 00:39:40,116
Stop!

463
00:39:43,536 --> 00:39:44,579
Shit.

464
00:39:47,707 --> 00:39:50,957
Oh, for goodness' sakes, look at yourself, Mitz.

465
00:39:51,086 --> 00:39:55,961
How many times do I have to tell you
green is not your colour?

466
00:39:59,594 --> 00:40:02,299
Do you think about Trumpet much?

467
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:03,473
No.

468
00:40:05,183 --> 00:40:09,181
Trumpet was just a nice kid
who had a thing about transsexuals.

469
00:40:09,312 --> 00:40:13,440
Lots of people do. Sort of bent status symbol.

470
00:40:13,567 --> 00:40:17,149
"My girlfriend used to be a boyfriend",
that sort of thing.

471
00:40:17,279 --> 00:40:19,686
Always good for a supper invite.

472
00:40:19,823 --> 00:40:22,740
Still, he was better than nothing.

473
00:40:25,203 --> 00:40:27,873
Nothing. Nothing for miles.

474
00:40:32,294 --> 00:40:35,663
~ <i>Can you hear the drums Fernando?</i> ~

475
00:40:35,797 --> 00:40:40,590
I've said it before and I'll say it again.
No more fucking ABBA.

476
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:44,171
OK, we may as well put the time to good use.

477
00:40:44,307 --> 00:40:47,806
Come on, girls, off your snatches.
Rehearsal time.

478
00:40:47,935 --> 00:40:52,265
~ <i>So you're back from outer space</i> ~

479
00:40:52,398 --> 00:40:56,016
- OK? Two bobs to start with, all right?
- Boring.

480
00:40:56,152 --> 00:40:57,403
Ready?

481
00:41:05,161 --> 00:41:06,869
I did this years ago.

482
00:41:06,996 --> 00:41:11,325
You did it so beautifully,
and, darling, you do it so well.

483
00:41:11,459 --> 00:41:13,747
Right, from the top.

484
00:41:13,878 --> 00:41:15,787
One, two...

485
00:41:15,922 --> 00:41:18,839
~ <i>Go on now, go, walk out the door</i> ~

486
00:41:18,966 --> 00:41:23,462
~ <i>Just turn around now,</i>
<i>You're not welcome any more</i> ~

487
00:41:23,596 --> 00:41:27,047
~ <i>Weren't you the one</i>
<i>who tried to break me with goodbyes...</i> ~

488
00:41:31,979 --> 00:41:33,231
Hello.

489
00:41:34,065 --> 00:41:36,437
Nice night for it.

490
00:42:15,691 --> 00:42:17,979
I think we just crashed a party.

491
00:42:19,653 --> 00:42:22,488
No, come on. You'll be right.

492
00:42:34,501 --> 00:42:37,502
Welcome to my office. Have a seat.

493
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:52,717
Bernice, what could have possessed you
to wear that to a corroboree?

494
00:42:52,854 --> 00:42:54,930
Shut your face.

495
00:43:10,788 --> 00:43:12,864
Bravo. Fabulous.

496
00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:21,667
Well, girls, I guess it's our turn.

497
00:43:29,557 --> 00:43:32,926
~ <i>First I was afraid I was petrified</i> ~

498
00:43:33,061 --> 00:43:37,010
~ <i>Kept thinking I could never live</i>
<i>Without you by my side</i> ~

499
00:43:37,148 --> 00:43:41,312
~ <i>But then I spent so many nights</i>
<i>Thinking how you did me wrong</i> ~

500
00:43:41,444 --> 00:43:45,277
~ <i>And I grew strong</i>
<i>And I learned how to get along</i> ~

501
00:43:45,407 --> 00:43:49,405
~ <i>And so you're back from outer space</i> ~

502
00:43:49,536 --> 00:43:53,368
~ <i>I just walked in to find you here</i>
<i>With that sad look upon your face</i> ~

503
00:43:53,499 --> 00:43:57,627
~ <i>I should have changed that stupid lock</i>
<i>I should have made you leave your key</i> ~

504
00:43:57,753 --> 00:44:01,798
~ <i>If I'd have known for just one second</i>
<i>You 'd be back to bother me</i> ~

505
00:44:01,924 --> 00:44:05,542
~ <i>Go on now go walk out the door</i> ~

506
00:44:05,678 --> 00:44:10,423
~ <i>Just turn around now</i>
<i>'Cause you're not welcome any more</i> ~

507
00:44:10,558 --> 00:44:14,176
~ <i>Weren't you the one</i>
<i>Who tried to hurt me with goodbye</i> ~

508
00:44:14,311 --> 00:44:18,261
~ <i>D'you think I'd crumble?</i>
<i>D'you think I'd lay down and die?</i> ~

509
00:44:18,399 --> 00:44:20,522
~ <i>Oh no not I</i> ~

510
00:44:20,651 --> 00:44:22,478
~ <i>I will survive</i> ~

511
00:44:22,611 --> 00:44:26,858
~ <i>Oh as long as I know how to love</i>
<i>I know I' II stay alive</i> ~

512
00:44:26,991 --> 00:44:30,988
~ <i>I've got all my life to live</i>
<i>And I've got all my love to give</i> ~

513
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:34,904
~ <i>And I' II survive I will survive</i> ~

514
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,665
~ <i>Hey hey</i> ~

515
00:44:43,508 --> 00:44:45,584
Hey, take a look at that.

516
00:44:48,555 --> 00:44:51,093
I've got an idea.

517
00:44:51,224 --> 00:44:55,554
~ <i>It took all the strength</i>
<i>I had not to fall apart</i> ~

518
00:44:55,687 --> 00:44:59,601
~ <i>Now I'm trying hard to mend</i>
<i>The pieces of my broken heart</i> ~

519
00:44:59,733 --> 00:45:03,777
~ <i>And I spent oh so many nights</i>
<i>Just feeling sorry for myself</i> ~

520
00:45:03,904 --> 00:45:08,032
~ <i>I used to cry</i>
<i>But now I hold my head up high</i> ~

521
00:45:38,104 --> 00:45:41,805
So you actually make money
by dressing up like a woman?

522
00:45:41,942 --> 00:45:46,106
Sure. You can make a fine living
in a pair of heels.

523
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:48,527
Why, Alan, you want a job?

524
00:45:58,584 --> 00:46:02,582
Oh. If only this dress could talk.

525
00:46:02,713 --> 00:46:06,663
Sometimes I wonder where I get my taste from.
Definitely not my mother.

526
00:46:06,801 --> 00:46:11,379
Serves me right
for letting her buy me these awful clothes.

527
00:46:12,098 --> 00:46:14,007
What's this?

528
00:46:15,393 --> 00:46:19,437
That, my darling, is my most treasured
possession in the whole world.

529
00:46:19,564 --> 00:46:21,603
But what is it?

530
00:46:21,732 --> 00:46:25,351
I went on a pilgrimage backstage
to an ABBA concert,

531
00:46:25,486 --> 00:46:28,606
hoping to grab an audience
with her royal highness Agnetha.

532
00:46:28,739 --> 00:46:33,282
Well, when I saw her ducking into the ladies,
naturally I followed her in.

533
00:46:33,411 --> 00:46:35,284
After she'd finished her business,

534
00:46:35,413 --> 00:46:40,869
I ducked into the cubicle, only to find
she'd left me a little gift in the toilet bowl.

535
00:46:41,002 --> 00:46:42,911
What are you telling me?

536
00:46:43,045 --> 00:46:45,501
This is an ABBA turd?

537
00:46:48,927 --> 00:46:51,597
I know what we can do with this.

538
00:46:51,847 --> 00:46:53,638
Are you right?

539
00:46:54,474 --> 00:46:56,143
Hang on.

540
00:46:56,351 --> 00:46:57,811
OK. Go.

541
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:21,501
There!

542
00:47:51,658 --> 00:47:55,157
Afternoon. What seems to be the problem?

543
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:04,710
- What a nice dog. What's its name?
- Herpes.

544
00:48:06,548 --> 00:48:08,706
If she's good, she'll heel.

545
00:48:11,594 --> 00:48:15,378
Things get pretty quiet around here.
We're a bit starved of entertainment.

546
00:48:15,515 --> 00:48:18,302
Glad we could oblige. How does it look?

547
00:48:20,645 --> 00:48:23,266
Your gas tank's chock-a-block full of crud.

548
00:48:23,398 --> 00:48:27,442
A rough road on a low tank
chucks it up into the motor.

549
00:48:27,569 --> 00:48:30,060
Your fuel line's blocked, injectors are stuffed.

550
00:48:30,196 --> 00:48:34,276
- So does that mean you can fix it?
- In the short term.

551
00:48:34,409 --> 00:48:37,659
What you blokes need is a new gas tank.

552
00:48:37,787 --> 00:48:40,159
Don't suppose you have one lying around?

553
00:48:40,290 --> 00:48:45,746
Sorry. Could get one in Coober Pedy in a week.
When do you have to be in Alice?

554
00:48:45,878 --> 00:48:47,755
Six days.

555
00:48:48,507 --> 00:48:53,881
Well, we can clear it out
and hope for the best. It might make it.

556
00:48:54,013 --> 00:48:56,005
Won't know unless you try.

557
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:58,346
Refreshments!

558
00:48:58,475 --> 00:49:00,931
Lemonade here I make.

559
00:49:01,061 --> 00:49:03,731
That's very nice, darling. Please go back inside.

560
00:49:03,856 --> 00:49:06,726
Lemonade, here I've made lemonade for guests.

561
00:49:06,859 --> 00:49:07,973
No, darling, please.

562
00:49:15,451 --> 00:49:17,536
Thank you.

563
00:49:18,037 --> 00:49:22,449
- We put cream on?
- No, no, it's face cream. It's for face.

564
00:49:24,209 --> 00:49:27,210
Bob, Cynthia, thank you.

565
00:49:28,464 --> 00:49:31,963
- I love lamb with meringue.
- Thank you for the company.

566
00:49:32,092 --> 00:49:35,675
Like I said, new faces are rare out here.

567
00:49:35,804 --> 00:49:37,927
What are you doing off the highway?

568
00:49:40,684 --> 00:49:46,189
Glad you bothered.
Don't get your type out here very often.

569
00:49:46,315 --> 00:49:50,266
- Me like to sing too. Me like.
- Yeah, pretty damn quiet.

570
00:49:50,403 --> 00:49:54,864
Thought of opening a video business,
but we gotta wait to get television first.

571
00:49:54,991 --> 00:49:57,233
Me perform for you. Me dance too.

572
00:49:57,369 --> 00:50:00,619
My wife used to be
in the entertainment business.

573
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:02,870
Yeah. You perform here?

574
00:50:02,999 --> 00:50:05,241
You thinking of performing here?

575
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:08,496
You've gotta be here at least another night.

576
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:11,417
The thought hadn't really crossed my mind.

577
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:15,678
I'll have a word with Wally at the pub.
Everybody'd love it.

578
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:19,671
I'm not sure
our show'd go down too well out here.

579
00:50:21,726 --> 00:50:25,641
- What kind of cabaret do you do?
- We dress up in women 's clothes

580
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:29,686
and parade around,
mouthing the words to other people's songs.

581
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:35,025
You mean, sort of like those...
What do they call them? Les Girls?

582
00:50:35,156 --> 00:50:37,944
I've seen them, in Sydney when I was young.

583
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:39,784
Fantastic. Just terrific.

584
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:45,866
Bob, you are looking at probably
the most famous Les Girl ever produced.

585
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:47,459
You're kidding me.

586
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:51,880
- Give me a break. I was never that famous.
- I'm not joking.

587
00:50:52,008 --> 00:50:56,753
What? I wouldn't have seen you.
That must have been 30 years back.

588
00:50:56,888 --> 00:51:00,422
- Oh, you'd be surprised.
- Me perform for you. Me sing.

589
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:03,393
No, Cynthia. They perform, not you.

590
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:15,615
Well, a real live Les Girls show.
Right, this calls for a celebration.

591
00:51:19,744 --> 00:51:21,653
Maybe this isn't a good idea.

592
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:25,951
Oh, shut your twat. Our frocks were
the sensation of Broken Hill, remember?

593
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:30,211
There was a Kmart there.
At least they knew what a frock was.

594
00:51:30,338 --> 00:51:35,249
Christ, you should see what this woman 's
wearing. It's a piece of corrugated iron.

595
00:51:39,597 --> 00:51:42,930
- Can I come in?
- Only if you're single.

596
00:51:48,397 --> 00:51:50,473
You look... incredible.

597
00:51:51,776 --> 00:51:54,897
- Where did we find this guy?
- Keep up the compliments.

598
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:58,814
Flattery will get you everywhere.
Where's that lovely wife of yours?

599
00:51:58,951 --> 00:52:02,485
At home.
She's not allowed in the pub any more.

600
00:52:02,621 --> 00:52:05,123
Really? Why?

601
00:52:05,290 --> 00:52:09,584
Problem with alcohol. Get her in the pub,
she makes a fool of herself.

602
00:52:09,711 --> 00:52:12,249
Oh, I know how she feels.

603
00:52:13,715 --> 00:52:16,919
Well, we're all waiting. You ready?

604
00:52:17,052 --> 00:52:18,303
Bob...

605
00:52:19,388 --> 00:52:22,057
We're having second thoughts.

606
00:52:22,182 --> 00:52:25,183
You can't. Every man and his dog's there.

607
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:28,893
- They're not chained up, are they?
- You blokes.

608
00:52:29,022 --> 00:52:32,854
Sorry. You girls.
You'll be fine, take my word for it.

609
00:53:09,272 --> 00:53:12,142
~ <i>There's nothing more that I'd like to do</i> ~

610
00:53:12,275 --> 00:53:15,726
~ <i>Than take the floor and dance with you</i> ~

611
00:53:15,862 --> 00:53:18,898
~ <i>Keep dancing</i> ~

612
00:53:19,032 --> 00:53:25,079
~ <i>Let's keep dancing</i> ~

613
00:53:28,541 --> 00:53:30,415
~ <i>Shake it shake it</i> ~

614
00:53:35,924 --> 00:53:37,548
~ <i>Shake it shake it</i> ~

615
00:53:38,384 --> 00:53:41,800
~ <i>Shake your groove thing</i>
<i>Shake your groove thing yeah yeah</i> ~

616
00:53:42,972 --> 00:53:47,551
~ <i>Show 'em how we do it now</i>
<i>Show 'em how we do it now</i> ~

617
00:53:48,311 --> 00:53:49,354
Yeah!

618
00:54:38,362 --> 00:54:40,438
What the hell's going on?

619
00:55:05,849 --> 00:55:07,557
She's not?

620
00:55:07,684 --> 00:55:09,144
Is she?

621
00:55:11,021 --> 00:55:14,686
Oh, you can't do that with a ping-pong ball.

622
00:55:16,026 --> 00:55:17,769
You wanna bet?

623
00:55:47,891 --> 00:55:50,602
Let go of me!

624
00:55:59,612 --> 00:56:02,815
- I'm going! - Darling, don't.
It's nothing we can't work out.

625
00:56:02,949 --> 00:56:05,522
- You no good man.
- Now, don't be silly.

626
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:08,863
You want good wife, you be good husband.

627
00:56:08,996 --> 00:56:11,238
Darling, don't go.

628
00:56:11,374 --> 00:56:15,122
I no like you, anyway. You got little ding-a-ling.

629
00:56:29,767 --> 00:56:32,768
Some days you just shouldn't get out of bed.

630
00:56:32,895 --> 00:56:37,522
In my opinion, you should wait here
until I get a new gas tank.

631
00:56:37,650 --> 00:56:41,185
Then again, listen to my last opinion.

632
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:44,736
Forget it, Bob. It's time we made a move.

633
00:56:44,865 --> 00:56:47,321
I'm just a gifted amateur round here.

634
00:56:47,451 --> 00:56:52,908
A frock and a catchy tune can't compete with
ping-pong balls, cigarettes and a pint of beer.

635
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:58,165
If we break down, we break down.
I'll stick to the main drag. Pardon the pun.

636
00:56:58,296 --> 00:57:01,630
Well, goodbye, Bob.
Thanks for a very educational stay.

637
00:57:01,758 --> 00:57:05,210
Yes, I'd love to open a bottle like that.

638
00:57:05,345 --> 00:57:09,213
Bernadette, it's certainly been an honour
meeting a member of Les Girls.

639
00:57:09,349 --> 00:57:12,516
And it's been an honour to meet a gentleman.

640
00:57:12,644 --> 00:57:17,353
Believe me, Bob, these days
gentlemen are an endangered species.

641
00:57:19,776 --> 00:57:23,774
Unlike bloody drag queens
who just keep breeding like rabbits.

642
00:57:31,413 --> 00:57:33,489
Oh, fuck it.

643
00:57:34,708 --> 00:57:38,207
Bob, fancy a free ride to Cooper Pedy?

644
00:57:43,678 --> 00:57:46,348
Now, listen, Bob, let's get one thing straight.

645
00:57:46,473 --> 00:57:50,471
We wear the frocks round here,
but that doesn't mean you wear the pants.

646
00:57:50,602 --> 00:57:55,063
- Right, where do I sleep?
- Oh, anywhere that takes your fancy.

647
00:57:55,190 --> 00:57:58,107
The roof'll do me fine.

648
00:57:58,235 --> 00:58:01,687
Thank you, Bob. I don't know what to say.

649
00:58:01,823 --> 00:58:07,113
That's all right. Might as well get there
a few days earlier. Bit of R and R.

650
00:58:07,245 --> 00:58:09,570
God knows I need it.

651
00:58:10,998 --> 00:58:16,538
~ <i>A diletti sempre nuovi</i>
<i>dee volare il mio pensier</i> ~

652
00:58:16,671 --> 00:58:19,874

653
00:58:20,007 --> 00:58:22,925
~ <i>Dee volare il mio pensier</i> ~

654
00:58:23,052 --> 00:58:26,088
~ <i>Dee volar dee volar</i> ~

655
00:58:26,222 --> 00:58:32,759
~ <i>Ah ah ah ah ah il mio pensier</i> ~

656
00:58:32,895 --> 00:58:36,395
Can I ask you a personal question?
If you don't mind.

657
00:58:36,524 --> 00:58:37,567
Sure.

658
00:58:38,818 --> 00:58:39,861
Why?

659
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:42,526
Why do you... you know?

660
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:47,528
You mean the 64,000 dollar question?

661
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:51,195
That's a girl. Now, don't
tear the wrapping paper.

662
00:58:51,330 --> 00:58:55,031
Just slide the ribbon off
and we'll see what Santa's bought you.

663
00:58:55,168 --> 00:58:59,415
Here it comes now.
What is it?

664
00:59:00,173 --> 00:59:01,833
Oh, it's a... It's a...

665
00:59:04,553 --> 00:59:06,177
Cement mixer.

666
00:59:08,682 --> 00:59:12,846
Have you been
changing the cards around again, Ralph?

667
00:59:16,523 --> 00:59:19,560
So I guess I had no choice in the matter.

668
00:59:19,693 --> 00:59:22,445
For fuck's sake.
Watch where you're driving, stupid bitch.

669
00:59:22,571 --> 00:59:25,691
- Are you trying to fucking kill me?
- My fault.

670
00:59:25,824 --> 00:59:29,276
Oh, sorry, Bob. I thought it was Bernadette.

671
00:59:35,626 --> 00:59:38,710
Now you're getting it. Who taught you to waltz?

672
00:59:38,837 --> 00:59:41,293
- My wife.
- Oh, how sweet.

673
00:59:41,423 --> 00:59:45,836
You and the missus at Arthur Murray's
every Tuesday, practising your little hearts out.

674
00:59:45,969 --> 00:59:49,552
- Makes me wanna sick up.
- Married?

675
00:59:49,681 --> 00:59:51,473
Yes, married.

676
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:55,218
We've only recently discovered
young Anthony here bats for both teams.

677
00:59:55,354 --> 00:59:56,931
I do not.

678
00:59:57,064 --> 00:59:59,270
- Oh, so we're straight?
- No.

679
00:59:59,399 --> 01:00:02,317
- Oh, so we're a doughnut puncher after all.
- No.

680
01:00:02,444 --> 01:00:06,609
- Then what the hell are we?
- I don't fucking know.

681
01:00:08,159 --> 01:00:10,650
What the fuck's that?

682
01:00:14,916 --> 01:00:16,541
Good evening.

683
01:00:17,418 --> 01:00:22,127
Nice night for it.
Oh, OK. Good night, then.

684
01:00:23,383 --> 01:00:25,589
What a rude woman.

685
01:00:35,562 --> 01:00:38,931
And that's the power-steering pump.
And that's the radiator fan.

686
01:00:39,065 --> 01:00:40,773
- How interesting.
- Simple.

687
01:00:48,867 --> 01:00:51,571
Hey! Who wants first bath?

688
01:01:07,511 --> 01:01:08,554
Won.

689
01:01:19,148 --> 01:01:21,271
Can I help you, ma'am?

690
01:01:30,910 --> 01:01:33,068
OK, turn her over.

691
01:01:51,055 --> 01:01:56,595
~ <i>I don't care if the sun don't shine</i>
<i>I get my lovin' in the evening time</i> ~

692
01:01:56,727 --> 01:02:01,887
~ <i>When I'm with my baby</i> ~

693
01:02:02,024 --> 01:02:04,645
~ <i>It's no fun with the sun around</i> ~

694
01:02:04,777 --> 01:02:12,074
~ <i>But I get going when the sun goes down</i>
<i>And I meet my baby</i> ~

695
01:02:12,202 --> 01:02:17,908
~ <i>That's when we kiss and kiss and kiss</i>
<i>And then we kiss some more</i> ~

696
01:02:18,041 --> 01:02:23,581
~ <i>Don't ask how many times we kiss</i>
<i>At a time like this who keeps score?</i> ~

697
01:02:23,713 --> 01:02:29,218
~ <i>So I don't care if the sun don't shine</i>
<i>I'll get my lovin' in the evening time</i> ~

698
01:02:29,344 --> 01:02:33,840
~ <i>When I'm with my baby</i> ~

699
01:02:55,078 --> 01:02:58,862
That's it over there.
It's an OK room with a shower.

700
01:02:58,999 --> 01:03:02,035
- Bags first.
- Is hot water all you can think about?

701
01:03:02,169 --> 01:03:05,454
A shower, bed and a nice meal will do fine.

702
01:03:05,589 --> 01:03:08,626
If you think I'm staying in, you can think again.

703
01:03:08,759 --> 01:03:13,006
Look, you blokes watch your back.
This is a tough little town.

704
01:03:13,139 --> 01:03:17,433
They get up, go down a hole,
blow things up and come up again.

705
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:21,889
- Fabulous.
- You're welcome to hang out with us if you like.

706
01:03:22,023 --> 01:03:27,064
I'm meeting the boys at the old drive-in
for a booze-up, like the old days.

707
01:03:27,195 --> 01:03:32,106
- I wanna go with Bob.
- You'll have supper with us, Adam Whitely,

708
01:03:32,241 --> 01:03:34,649
or you'll stay in and watch TV.

709
01:04:02,355 --> 01:04:04,893
He's a good man, our Bob.

710
01:04:05,024 --> 01:04:09,237
Yeah. Not my type, though.

711
01:04:09,363 --> 01:04:12,364
Oh, don't come the raw prawn with me.

712
01:04:12,491 --> 01:04:15,445
I can spot a fluttering lash from 300 paces.

713
01:04:15,577 --> 01:04:18,495
Oh, get out. He's far too old.

714
01:04:20,249 --> 01:04:22,372
Mind you, so am I.

715
01:04:23,585 --> 01:04:27,085
Did you catch that mail-order bride?

716
01:04:27,881 --> 01:04:30,503
Why'd he marry? I'm dying to ask.

717
01:04:31,802 --> 01:04:33,426
Whoops. Sorry.

718
01:04:34,721 --> 01:04:39,680
Don't worry about it.
You're the world's best husband.

719
01:04:39,810 --> 01:04:44,436
And given the chance,
a perfectly good father too.

720
01:04:44,565 --> 01:04:48,776
- Do you really think so?
- Why? Thinking about children?

721
01:04:49,945 --> 01:04:52,650
Yes, as a matter of fact.

722
01:05:08,547 --> 01:05:12,166
Um, do you have the Texas Chainsaw Mascara?

723
01:05:16,264 --> 01:05:19,715
- Ever wanted kids?
- Sure.

724
01:05:19,851 --> 01:05:23,136
But I've learned not to think about it.

725
01:05:25,315 --> 01:05:28,518
D'you think an old queen 's
capable of raising a child?

726
01:05:28,651 --> 01:05:31,855
Well, Elizabeth did a pretty good job.

727
01:05:31,988 --> 01:05:34,657
Prince Charles is a wonderful boy.

728
01:05:34,783 --> 01:05:38,116
Edward's still a bit of a worry.

729
01:05:39,329 --> 01:05:42,330
What happens if they turn out like Adam?

730
01:05:42,457 --> 01:05:46,537
You stuff them back in and ask for a refund.

731
01:05:48,505 --> 01:05:53,665
Stupid little shit.
I dread to think what he's up to.

732
01:06:22,289 --> 01:06:26,204
Hello. I'm new in town.

733
01:06:27,044 --> 01:06:29,203
No kidding.

734
01:06:29,338 --> 01:06:32,339
Could I have a Bloody Mary, please?

735
01:06:32,466 --> 01:06:35,040
It's a beer or nothing... sweetheart.

736
01:06:37,263 --> 01:06:39,754
Well, I'd better have a beer, then.

737
01:06:40,641 --> 01:06:42,101
Cheers.

738
01:06:46,355 --> 01:06:49,060
What are you all looking at?

739
01:06:51,110 --> 01:06:55,819
I'm sorry.
Didn't mean to stare.

740
01:06:55,948 --> 01:06:58,700
We don't usually get women down here.

741
01:07:01,036 --> 01:07:05,698
So what do women do around here
besides watching videos?

742
01:07:07,543 --> 01:07:10,627
Well, well, well, look who we have here!

743
01:07:12,631 --> 01:07:15,254
You know that bloke, do you?

744
01:07:19,139 --> 01:07:20,182
No.

745
01:07:21,933 --> 01:07:25,349
So, who's gonna show me the sights?

746
01:07:27,647 --> 01:07:29,723
Be my pleasure.

747
01:07:33,528 --> 01:07:35,984
So how about it?

748
01:07:38,825 --> 01:07:41,696
I suppose a fuck's out of the question.

749
01:07:51,254 --> 01:07:55,797
Come on, boys.
Who wants to see my map of Tasmania?

750
01:07:55,926 --> 01:08:03,138
So I never got a chance to tell my parents
what a wonderful childhood I'd had.

751
01:08:03,266 --> 01:08:07,809
They never spoke to me again
after I'd had... the chop.

752
01:08:12,567 --> 01:08:15,735
I think... I have something to tell you.

753
01:08:17,615 --> 01:08:19,358
Oh, shit.

754
01:08:32,922 --> 01:08:35,793
OK, let's not forget how to treat a lady.

755
01:08:35,925 --> 01:08:37,550
You fucking freak!

756
01:08:41,889 --> 01:08:46,136
- Hold him down. Spread his legs.
- No. Please.

757
01:08:48,479 --> 01:08:50,223
Frank, stop!

758
01:08:50,356 --> 01:08:53,523
Stop! What the fuck do you think you're doing?

759
01:08:53,651 --> 01:08:57,980
- You mean you do know this cocksucker?
- Get off him, you mongrel.

760
01:08:58,114 --> 01:09:01,732
He was joking, OK?
You leave the little bugger alone.

761
01:09:01,868 --> 01:09:04,822
- Get outta there, Bob.
- Cut it out, Frank.

762
01:09:04,954 --> 01:09:08,370
Put the faggot down and fuck off
or you're next.

763
01:09:08,499 --> 01:09:10,373
- Frank.
- Get out of there!

764
01:09:10,501 --> 01:09:14,748
Stop flexing your muscles,
you big pile of budgie turd.

765
01:09:14,881 --> 01:09:21,050
Your mates will be more impressed if you go
back to the pub and fuck some pigs on the bar.

766
01:09:21,180 --> 01:09:22,638
Bernadette, please.

767
01:09:22,764 --> 01:09:25,058
Bernadette!

768
01:09:25,225 --> 01:09:28,974
Well, I'll be darned. The whole circus is in town.

769
01:09:29,104 --> 01:09:34,181
I suppose you want a fuck too, do you?
Come on, Bernadette. Come and fuck me.

770
01:09:34,318 --> 01:09:35,776
That's it.

771
01:09:37,070 --> 01:09:39,478
Come on. Come and fuck me.

772
01:09:39,615 --> 01:09:41,073
Come on.

773
01:09:42,659 --> 01:09:43,940
Fuck me.

774
01:09:49,708 --> 01:09:50,959
There.

775
01:09:51,335 --> 01:09:53,078
Now you're fucked.

776
01:09:53,212 --> 01:09:56,415
You stupid bloody idiot!
Drugs, for Christ's sake.

777
01:09:56,548 --> 01:10:01,459
Well, three cheers for you.
I hope you're bloody well happy now!

778
01:10:07,643 --> 01:10:09,937
It's funny.

779
01:10:10,270 --> 01:10:15,644
We all sit around, mindlessly slagging off
that vile stink hole of a city...

780
01:10:17,027 --> 01:10:21,322
...but in its own strange way,
it takes care of us.

781
01:10:21,449 --> 01:10:29,113
I don't know if that ugly wall of suburbia's
there to stop them getting in or us getting out.

782
01:10:32,710 --> 01:10:34,335
Come on.

783
01:10:35,505 --> 01:10:40,333
Don't let it drag you down.
Let it toughen you up.

784
01:10:41,219 --> 01:10:45,086
I can only fight because I've learned to.

785
01:10:45,223 --> 01:10:52,139
Being a man one day and a woman the next
is not an easy thing to do.

786
01:10:52,272 --> 01:10:54,893
- Sorry, can't help you.
- No worries.

787
01:10:58,653 --> 01:11:01,274
Are we bunny-hopping all the way to Alice?

788
01:11:01,406 --> 01:11:06,400
- No good. The man to help is a fair way away.
- Like how fair?

789
01:11:06,536 --> 01:11:08,160
Couple of hundred clicks fair.

790
01:11:08,288 --> 01:11:12,582
No matter. I've got nothing else to do today.
Let's get outta here.

791
01:11:12,709 --> 01:11:14,867
Come on, Adam. We're not here.

Some things are said in the heat of the moment.

796
01:11:50,164 --> 01:11:53,331
I'm sorry I got angry with you last night.

797
01:11:53,459 --> 01:11:56,128
Although I dare say you deserved it.

798
01:11:56,253 --> 01:11:58,958
Anyway, that's enough of that.

799
01:12:00,007 --> 01:12:03,341
This is quite an experience,
sitting here with you now.

800
01:12:03,469 --> 01:12:09,673
I can quite safely say that I think
your taste in clothing is absolutely terrible

801
01:12:13,103 --> 01:12:15,143
Oh, this is great fun!

802
01:12:19,735 --> 01:12:22,523
We're going to have a problem finding this guy.

803
01:12:22,656 --> 01:12:25,407
- Why do you say that?
- He's not out here.

804
01:12:25,534 --> 01:12:28,107
Oh, he's out here. He's in Alice.

805
01:12:29,162 --> 01:12:35,699
Well, I can't go back to Coober Pedy for a while.
Not the most popular bloke back there now.

806
01:12:48,056 --> 01:12:49,307
Hello.

807
01:12:50,058 --> 01:12:51,309
Hello.

808
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:55,394
- Who are you?
- I your wife.

809
01:12:57,941 --> 01:13:01,891
- Guess I'll be going home.
- No, you no going. I coming too.

810
01:13:02,028 --> 01:13:05,397
I your wife. See? I your wife.

811
01:13:05,532 --> 01:13:07,826
Silly girl.

812
01:13:08,577 --> 01:13:11,198
Should have done her homework better.

813
01:13:11,329 --> 01:13:13,820
She thought I was from Sydney.

814
01:13:13,957 --> 01:13:16,709
Why in God's name did you bring her home?

815
01:13:16,835 --> 01:13:20,251
- She was my wife.
- Couldn't you sell her off?

816
01:13:20,380 --> 01:13:26,466
Oh, the party's over, everyone. It talks.
Can't keep a good bitch down.

817
01:13:26,596 --> 01:13:29,762
What time do you reckon
we'll be in Alice Springs?

818
01:13:29,891 --> 01:13:33,639
- Late tomorrow arvo.
- And how long will you be staying?

819
01:13:33,769 --> 01:13:36,687
Don't know Couple of days, maybe.

820
01:13:37,565 --> 01:13:41,064
Big day for you tomorrow.
We get to meet the missus.

821
01:13:41,194 --> 01:13:43,067
I saw that smile, Felicia.

822
01:13:43,196 --> 01:13:45,603
One word, one derogatory word,

823
01:13:45,740 --> 01:13:50,117
and I'm gonna take you back
to your mate in Coober Pedy.

824
01:13:50,244 --> 01:13:54,194
Look, everyone, tomorrow's going to be tough.
Please don't make it harder.

825
01:13:54,332 --> 01:13:58,709
We're only teasing. We won't open our mouths
until you give the word.

826
01:13:58,836 --> 01:14:00,912
Then it's open season.

827
01:14:14,644 --> 01:14:16,886
Ah, well, time for bed.

828
01:14:17,021 --> 01:14:22,561
Got to look good for the wife in the morning.
Come along, Adam, time for beauty sleep.

829
01:14:23,987 --> 01:14:26,395
Will you two be joining us?

830
01:14:26,532 --> 01:14:29,616
I just thought I'd have one for the road.

831
01:14:29,743 --> 01:14:32,910
- How about you, Bob?
- Sounds good to me.

832
01:14:33,038 --> 01:14:36,988
All right, then.
See you in the morning. Good night.

833
01:14:39,670 --> 01:14:42,339
- Another piece of cake, Bob?
- Nah.

834
01:14:48,262 --> 01:14:51,962
So, tell me about you.

835
01:14:53,475 --> 01:14:57,140
Can't complain. Life's a lot simpler now.

836
01:14:57,271 --> 01:15:00,390
Spent 30 years wandering around the world

837
01:15:00,524 --> 01:15:04,604
only to find that I was
better off where I started.

838
01:15:05,737 --> 01:15:08,110
Not much, but it's my turf.

839
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:09,908
Oh, shit

840
01:15:24,047 --> 01:15:25,091
Adam.

841
01:15:27,385 --> 01:15:28,428
Adam.

842
01:15:29,804 --> 01:15:32,889
- What?
- Guess who didn't come home last night.

843
01:15:39,772 --> 01:15:42,726
I've waited all my life for this.

844
01:15:42,859 --> 01:15:47,022
Bernice has left her cake out in the rain.

01:16:30,741 --> 01:16:32,022
I need a crap.

850
01:16:32,159 --> 01:16:35,326
- Do you want me to go in?
- No, I'll go.

851
01:16:37,331 --> 01:16:41,543
Excuse me, sir, you can't park here.
Are you staying at the hotel?

852
01:16:41,669 --> 01:16:46,461
Sorry, could you direct me to Marion Barber?
We're the cabaret act from Sydney.

853
01:16:46,632 --> 01:16:49,586
Oh, right. Reception will take you through.

854
01:16:49,718 --> 01:16:51,129
- Thanks.
- No worries.

855
01:16:51,262 --> 01:16:54,465
It's all right, Lenny, it's the drag queens.

856
01:16:56,058 --> 01:16:59,261
Come on, Bob, let's go try on your new frock.

857
01:16:59,395 --> 01:17:00,646
G'day.

858
01:17:02,940 --> 01:17:07,068
- Just over there by the back bar.
- Thanks.

859
01:17:12,158 --> 01:17:14,613
No, those three cakes didn't arrive.

860
01:17:14,743 --> 01:17:18,824
I need them today. Not tomorrow, but today.
You're a doll.

861
01:17:18,956 --> 01:17:20,913
What an arsehole.

862
01:17:25,129 --> 01:17:29,293
- My God. Husband, it's so good to see you.
- Hiya, wife.

863
01:17:29,426 --> 01:17:32,178
You're a day late! Where are the others?

864
01:17:32,304 --> 01:17:35,221
- They're outside.
- You've lost weight, you rotten old queer.

865
01:17:35,348 --> 01:17:39,726
About fucking time. I can get into
that one-piece of yours with the sunflowers.

866
01:17:39,853 --> 01:17:45,013
- What the hell do you do with it?
- <i>Poseidon Adventure</i> routine. Shelley Winters.

Where is he?

Hello.

Where's the bloody spa?

874
01:18:42,125 --> 01:18:44,876
- Mr Belrose?
- Yes?

875
01:18:45,878 --> 01:18:48,334
Congratulations. It's a boy.

876
01:18:55,346 --> 01:18:58,051
- You OK?
- What's the matter?

877
01:18:58,266 --> 01:19:00,638
Christ, Mitz, why didn't you tell us?

878
01:19:00,768 --> 01:19:04,766
Why'd you have to shock me like that?

879
01:19:04,897 --> 01:19:08,266
This lump on my head
is getting bigger by the second.

880
01:19:08,401 --> 01:19:10,974
I'm about to make
my Northern Territories debut

881
01:19:11,112 --> 01:19:15,062
looking like a cartoon character
hit me over the head with an iron.

882
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:18,284
- You look more like a Disney witch.
- Shut your face.

883
01:19:18,411 --> 01:19:22,111
I don't look like
someone tried to open a can with my face.

884
01:19:22,248 --> 01:19:27,124
Sorry. I couldn't stand being bagged for two
weeks. Anyway, what difference does it make?

885
01:19:27,253 --> 01:19:29,376
Two inches to my head, for one.

886
01:19:29,505 --> 01:19:33,124
- Did you see? He's got my profile.
- I'm going to be sick.

887
01:19:33,260 --> 01:19:36,388
I hate to be practical here,
but does he know who you are?

888
01:19:36,492 --> 01:19:38,453
I mean, does he know
what you do for a living?

889
01:19:38,557 --> 01:19:42,305
He knows he has a father
in the show business/cosmetics industry.

890
01:19:42,436 --> 01:19:47,312
- Oh, Lord, I don't understand.
- No, you don't, so stop trying. It'll be fine.

891
01:19:47,441 --> 01:19:51,141
- It better be.
- Hello. Oh, stop wearing out that mirror.

892
01:19:51,278 --> 01:19:56,189
- Always knock before you enter.
- Always? Why? Got anything to hide in there?

893
01:19:56,325 --> 01:20:01,366
- All right, girls, you're on in ten minutes.
- You've been on since you were born.

894
01:20:01,497 --> 01:20:04,497
- We've got a big crowd.
- Like how big?

895
01:20:04,625 --> 01:20:06,831
A full house.

896
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:10,164
- Where's Benj?
- Safe and sound asleep in bed. Don't worry.

897
01:20:10,297 --> 01:20:12,290
OK, my little powder puff.

898
01:20:13,425 --> 01:20:18,383
- Can I come in?
- Now, there's a gentleman. Of course, Bob.

899
01:20:19,932 --> 01:20:21,889
My Aunt Minnie in here?

900
01:20:23,519 --> 01:20:27,730
- Don't mean to barge in. Just wishing you luck.
- Thank you, Bob.

901
01:20:29,316 --> 01:20:34,560
- To make up for what happened last time.
- Thank you. That's so thoughtful.

902
01:20:34,697 --> 01:20:40,902
All right, girls, let's get this show on the road.
You, out. That's a ten-minute curtain call.

903
01:20:43,540 --> 01:20:49,412
Quite a wife you've got. What does she do
for fun? Sand oil-tanker hulls with her tongue?

904
01:20:49,546 --> 01:20:51,918
She sure is something.

905
01:20:52,757 --> 01:20:54,714
- Chookers, girls.
- Watch my jaw.

906
01:20:54,843 --> 01:20:58,377
- Be careful with my head.
- Aren't we fabulous?

~ <i>The one who showed me true love</i>
<i>Or at least it seemed</i> ~

913
01:21:26,166 --> 01:21:30,163
~ <i>With brown cocoa skin and curly black hair</i> ~

914
01:21:30,295 --> 01:21:34,459
~ <i>It's just the way he looks at me</i>
<i>That gentle loving stare</i> ~

915
01:21:34,592 --> 01:21:37,961
~ <i>Finally you 've come along</i> ~

916
01:21:38,095 --> 01:21:42,045
~ <i>The way I feel about you</i>
<i>It just can't be wrong</i> ~

917
01:21:42,183 --> 01:21:46,726
~ <i>If you only knew the way I feel about you</i> ~

918
01:21:46,854 --> 01:21:49,345
~ <i>I just can't describe it</i> ~

919
01:21:49,482 --> 01:21:50,644
~ <i>Oh no no</i> ~

920
01:21:50,774 --> 01:21:55,733
~ <i>Finally it has happened to me</i>
<i>Right in front of my face</i> ~

921
01:21:55,863 --> 01:21:58,318
~ <i>My feelings can't describe it</i> ~

926

927

~ <i>And I just cannot hide it</i> ~

928
01:22:22,598 --> 01:22:25,967
~ <i>It seems so many times</i>
<i>You seemed to be the one</i> ~

929
01:22:26,101 --> 01:22:29,969
~ <i>But all he ever wanted</i>
<i>was to have a little fun</i> ~

930
01:22:30,105 --> 01:22:34,056
~ <i>But now you 've come along</i>

931
01:22:34,194 --> 01:22:38,523
~ <i>In my heart I feel it</i>

932
01:22:38,657 --> 01:22:41,860
~ <i>Finally you 've come along</i> ~

~ <i>I just can't describe it</i> ~

936
01:22:53,547 --> 01:22:54,661
~ <i>Oh no no</i> ~

937
01:22:54,798 --> 01:22:59,507
~ <i>Finally it has happened to me</i>

938
01:22:59,636 --> 01:23:02,423
~ <i>My feelings can't describe it</i> ~

939
01:23:02,556 --> 01:23:07,467
~ <i>Finally it has happened to me</i>

940
01:23:07,602 --> 01:23:10,307

~ <i>And I just cannot hide it</i> ~

945
01:23:26,580 --> 01:23:29,718
~ <i>Finally</i> ~

946
01:23:29,822 --> 01:23:33,263
~ <i>Oh finally</i> ~

947
01:23:33,368 --> 01:23:34,669
~ <i>Yeah</i> ~

948
01:23:34,796 --> 01:23:37,925
~ <i>Yeah</i> ~

949
01:24:14,712 --> 01:24:19,540
~ <i>Finally it has happened to me</i>
<i>Right in front of my face</i> ~

~ <i>Finally it has happened to me</i>

952
01:24:27,683 --> 01:24:30,388
~ <i>And I just cannot hide it</i> ~

953
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:33,556
~ <i>Finally oh yeah</i> ~

954
01:24:33,689 --> 01:24:36,819
~ <i>Yeah</i> ~

955
01:24:43,784 --> 01:24:45,860
~ <i>Finally oh yeah</i> ~

956
01:25:04,221 --> 01:25:05,264
More!

957
01:25:08,183 --> 01:25:10,639
Come on, everybody!

958
01:25:10,769 --> 01:25:14,767
Yes, more! More! Come on!

959
01:25:15,649 --> 01:25:18,484
- You're wonderful!
- We want more!

960
01:25:18,610 --> 01:25:22,904
Yes! Magnificent! Bravo!

961
01:25:27,703 --> 01:25:31,285
Come on, snap out of it.

962
01:25:31,415 --> 01:25:33,372
You'll be fine.

963
01:25:35,252 --> 01:25:37,541
Come on, love.

964
01:25:37,671 --> 01:25:39,083
That's it, mate.

965
01:25:39,924 --> 01:25:44,752
- You scared us all for a minute.
- You had to have that extra bit of attention.

966
01:25:44,888 --> 01:25:46,714
Nice one, lovie, nice one.

967
01:25:46,848 --> 01:25:47,891
Shit.

968
01:25:48,475 --> 01:25:52,472
What are you doing, Marion, you liar?
You said he'd be in bed.

969
01:25:52,604 --> 01:25:55,770
- Oh, shush, drink your daiquiri.
- I hate bloody daiquiri.

970
01:25:55,899 --> 01:25:58,983
No, you don't, you love bloody daiquiris.

971
01:25:59,110 --> 01:26:04,271
Now I know why drag queens drink from such
big glasses. To make their hands look smaller.

972
01:26:04,407 --> 01:26:09,069
What am I meant to say to the boy?
I've never been so embarrassed.

973
01:26:09,204 --> 01:26:10,864
- You're overreacting.
- Really?

974
01:26:10,997 --> 01:26:16,584
You're being a drama queen. You'll have to
drop that shit if you're gonna be a good father.

975
01:26:16,711 --> 01:26:20,412
Don't look surprised.
I've kept my end of the bargain, it's your turn.

976
01:26:20,548 --> 01:26:24,166
- Not for ever, maybe a couple of months.
- Why now?

977
01:26:24,302 --> 01:26:30,921
Because I haven't had a holiday in eight years.
I need a rest, Tick. I need some space.

978
01:26:31,059 --> 01:26:33,312
- Reminds me of something I said recently.

979
01:26:33,416 --> 01:26:36,218
- Well, I do. Besides,
it's time he knew his father.

980
01:26:36,356 --> 01:26:40,022
That's the problem.
I don't know what to tell him.

981
01:26:40,152 --> 01:26:42,275
What do you assume I do? Lie?

982
01:26:42,404 --> 01:26:46,449
Assumption is the mother of all fuck-ups.
Bitch to him, not me.

983
01:26:46,575 --> 01:26:51,036
- Thanks for the free advice.
- You might be in for a pleasant surprise.

984
01:26:57,920 --> 01:26:59,331
Who is it?

985
01:26:59,463 --> 01:27:01,456
It's me, Bob.

986
01:27:05,261 --> 01:27:10,421
The flowers were being mangled.
Thought I'd rescue them for you.

987
01:27:12,434 --> 01:27:14,511
Good idea. Thanks.

988
01:27:24,780 --> 01:27:26,987
What's the matter?

989
01:27:27,116 --> 01:27:28,784
Nothing.

990
01:27:33,247 --> 01:27:36,912
- You know what your father does for a living?
- Yeah.

991
01:27:40,881 --> 01:27:43,917
So I suppose you know he doesn't like girls?

992
01:27:44,050 --> 01:27:47,301
Does he have a boyfriend at the moment?

993
01:27:47,429 --> 01:27:48,472
No.

994
01:27:49,014 --> 01:27:53,225
Neither does Mum.
She had a girlfriend but she got over her.

995
01:27:57,856 --> 01:28:02,019
Do you wanna come and play in my room?
I've got Lego.

996
01:28:02,152 --> 01:28:03,195
Sure.

997
01:28:09,409 --> 01:28:14,652
Come on, Butch, get a move on.
We can't brand the cattle by ourselves.

998
01:28:14,789 --> 01:28:19,001
- Great show. You always end like that?
- Always.

999
01:28:21,463 --> 01:28:24,499
- Like to pick her up every night?
- Be a pleasure.

1000
01:28:24,633 --> 01:28:27,799
That might include
tucking the lady into bed, Jeff.

1001
01:28:27,928 --> 01:28:30,134
What's the pay like, Marion?

1002
01:28:30,263 --> 01:28:35,139
He'll get himself into trouble one day,
and you might just be the lucky fellow.

1003
01:28:35,268 --> 01:28:36,763
Come on, all aboard.

1004
01:28:41,233 --> 01:28:45,646
Watch it with the innuendos.
Give me a clear shot.

1005
01:28:45,780 --> 01:28:49,398
You call dressing up
like a <i>Xanadu</i> production number a clear shot?

1006
01:28:49,534 --> 01:28:52,321
Come on, Tick, who's kidding who round here?

1007
01:28:52,453 --> 01:28:54,778
He sure as shit isn't.

1008
01:29:07,468 --> 01:29:10,090
- What am I doing?
- Swimming!

1009
01:29:13,558 --> 01:29:14,933
A rock.

1010
01:29:15,059 --> 01:29:16,518
Little Rock.

1011
01:29:16,644 --> 01:29:19,052
Oh, Rock! Rock Hudson!

1012
01:29:21,274 --> 01:29:22,472
My turn!

1013
01:29:22,608 --> 01:29:25,693
OK, smarty-pants, you give it a go.

1014
01:29:25,820 --> 01:29:27,647
Come on, then.

1015
01:29:27,780 --> 01:29:30,069
It's a... sexy woman.

1016
01:29:30,199 --> 01:29:31,859
- Cat.
- Famous woman.

1017
01:29:34,328 --> 01:29:36,072
- Baby.
- Rocking.

1018
01:29:36,205 --> 01:29:38,494
- I know this one.
- Race horse.

1019
01:29:38,624 --> 01:29:40,083
Cat. Scary cat?

1020
01:29:40,209 --> 01:29:42,451
Scary moose?

1021
01:29:42,587 --> 01:29:45,079
- Scary dog.
- I know, I know.

1022
01:29:45,215 --> 01:29:47,967
Oh, Lindy Chamberlain.

1023
01:29:49,052 --> 01:29:51,543
That was appalling, Benji. Who taught you that?

1024
01:29:51,680 --> 01:29:53,922
- Mum did.
- Lies, all lies.

1025
01:29:55,726 --> 01:29:58,395
Come on, Adam.

1026
01:29:58,520 --> 01:30:01,272
Up. Time is against us.

1027
01:30:01,398 --> 01:30:03,723
And we have things to do.

1028
01:30:06,612 --> 01:30:10,609
- Come on, you butch thing, you.
- No, count me out.

1029
01:30:10,741 --> 01:30:12,484
- All for one.
- Come on.

1030
01:30:12,618 --> 01:30:13,660
No.

1031
01:30:17,539 --> 01:30:21,074
Come on, Adam, let's get frocked.

1032
01:30:26,423 --> 01:30:27,466
So...

1033
01:30:28,675 --> 01:30:31,961
...what's it like to finally have a father?

1034
01:30:32,888 --> 01:30:34,139
T's OK

1035
01:30:39,436 --> 01:30:44,182
I'm sorry about last night.
I don't always dress up in women 's clothes.

1036
01:30:44,316 --> 01:30:47,235
You know, don't get the wrong idea.

1037
01:30:49,739 --> 01:30:57,201
I mean, I do a lot of different stuff, you know,
like... Elvis, and... Gary Glitter and...

1038
01:30:57,330 --> 01:30:58,373
ABBA?

1039
01:31:02,168 --> 01:31:07,411
I'm not supposed to know about the ABBA show,
but I'd like to see it.

1040
01:31:07,549 --> 01:31:09,874
Would you do ABBA for me?

1041
01:31:11,678 --> 01:31:12,720
Sure.

1042
01:31:18,768 --> 01:31:21,935
You know what I am, don't you?

1043
01:31:22,063 --> 01:31:25,064
Mum says you're the best in the business.

1044
01:31:26,359 --> 01:31:29,894
Well, your mother
was always prone to exaggeration.

1045
01:31:33,116 --> 01:31:37,363
Will you have a boyfriend
when we get back to Sydney?

1046
01:31:40,623 --> 01:31:41,666
Mayoo

1047
01:31:44,043 --> 01:31:45,917
That's good.

1048
01:31:57,558 --> 01:31:59,432
- Come on.
- Where are we going?

1049
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:02,846
We're going to unleash the best in the business.

1050
01:32:10,154 --> 01:32:12,312
I had a dream.

1051
01:33:50,381 --> 01:33:53,216
Well, we did it.

1052
01:33:55,303 --> 01:33:59,087
It never ends, does it? All that space.

1053
01:34:04,687 --> 01:34:07,190
So what now?

1054
01:34:07,398 --> 01:34:10,019
I think I wanna go home.

1055
01:34:11,694 --> 01:34:12,945
Me too

1056
01:34:15,031 --> 01:34:16,904
Well, then.

1057
01:34:17,033 --> 01:34:20,236
Let's finish the shows and go home.

1058
01:34:34,634 --> 01:34:36,875
Don't go without leaving your number, sunshine.

1059
01:34:37,011 --> 01:34:42,681
Already taken care of. It's at the far end of the
men 's cubicle. "For a good time, phone Felicia."

1060
01:34:42,809 --> 01:34:47,352
- Can we stop at McDonalds?
- Good idea. I've had enough of this shitty food.

1061
01:34:47,480 --> 01:34:49,556
Where the hell d'you start?

1062
01:34:49,690 --> 01:34:53,260
Lay it on the line, conceal nothing.
That's the key.

1063
01:34:53,364 --> 01:34:56,654
If he doesn't like it he can buy a ticket back.

1064
01:34:56,782 --> 01:35:00,614
- And when people realise Mitzi's got a minor?
- Your problem, not his.

1065
01:35:00,744 --> 01:35:05,739
He knows when to listen. Morals are a choice
and he'll decide when he's ready.

1066
01:35:05,874 --> 01:35:08,199
Well, that's it. You're all packed.

1067
01:35:08,335 --> 01:35:12,499
You've gotta be joking. We haven't got
Bernadette's shoes upon board yet.

1068
01:35:12,631 --> 01:35:15,039
Hate to say, wish I was coming.

1069
01:35:15,175 --> 01:35:19,090
Your gas tank'll be fine.
Your axle may be another matter.

1070
01:35:19,221 --> 01:35:24,298
The road home will be filled with bored
mechanics waiting for you to spirit them away.

1071
01:35:24,434 --> 01:35:28,053
We're not even gonna spirit gum at this rate.
Where's Bernadette?

1072
01:35:28,188 --> 01:35:29,231
Here.

1073
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:34,685
Come on, cabanossi tits. Where are your bags?

1074
01:35:34,820 --> 01:35:37,114
In my room.

1075
01:35:38,073 --> 01:35:41,857
I'm not going.
I've decided to stay here for a while.

1076
01:35:41,994 --> 01:35:44,781
Really? And you're choosing to tell us now.

1077
01:35:44,913 --> 01:35:50,916
She told me a few weeks back. I need someone
to handle guest entertainment while I'm away.

1078
01:35:51,044 --> 01:35:54,995
I get it. Who's been playing hide the sausage?

1079
01:35:56,342 --> 01:36:01,467
Let's get outta here before I throw up.
Come on, Benj. Hope you can drive.

1080
01:36:01,598 --> 01:36:03,674
Hey, not without a hug.

1081
01:36:09,481 --> 01:36:10,891
You sure?

1082
01:36:12,025 --> 01:36:14,017
No, I'm not sure.

1083
01:36:15,528 --> 01:36:19,193
But I'll never know unless I give it a shot.

1084
01:36:33,755 --> 01:36:36,791
I'm as jealous as all hell.

1085
01:36:37,759 --> 01:36:38,801
Shit.

1086
01:36:39,594 --> 01:36:41,670
Racoon time again.

1087
01:36:44,933 --> 01:36:49,227
- Bye. Don't forget to write.
- See you. Wish I was staying.

1088
01:36:51,147 --> 01:36:53,271
Bye, Ralph!

1089
01:36:53,400 --> 01:36:55,393
Yeah, see ya, Ralph.
