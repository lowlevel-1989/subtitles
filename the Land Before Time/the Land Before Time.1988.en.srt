00:02:24,181 --> 00:02:26,617
Once upon this same earth,

3
00:02:26,685 --> 00:02:29,121
beneath this same sun,

4
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,092
long before you...

5
00:02:31,161 --> 00:02:35,100
before the ape
and the elephant as well,

6
00:02:35,168 --> 00:02:39,130
before the wolf,
the bison, the whale,

7
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:42,611
before the mammoth
and the mastodon

8
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,709
in the time
of the dinosaurs.

9
00:02:47,222 --> 00:02:48,622
Come on!

10
00:02:48,691 --> 00:02:51,127
Dinosaurs
were of two kinds -

11
00:02:51,196 --> 00:02:56,160
Some had flat teeth
and ate the leaves of trees.

12
00:02:56,238 --> 00:02:59,676
Some had sharp teeth
for eating meat.

13
00:02:59,743 --> 00:03:02,647
They preyed upon
the leaf-eaters.

14
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:05,151
Then leaves began to die.

15
00:03:05,221 --> 00:03:09,160
The mighty beasts,
who appeared to rule earth,

16
00:03:09,228 --> 00:03:12,666
were ruled, in truth,
by the leaf.

17
00:03:12,733 --> 00:03:14,167
Desperate for food,

18
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:16,428
some dinosaur herds

19
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:17,988
struck out toward the west,

20
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:20,501
searching for
their Great Valley,

21
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:23,540
a land still lush and green.

22
00:03:23,608 --> 00:03:26,603
lt was a journey toward life.

23
00:03:34,126 --> 00:03:37,565
lt was a march of many dangers.

24
00:03:37,633 --> 00:03:39,569
Sharpteeth stalked the herds,

25
00:03:39,637 --> 00:03:42,540
waiting to seize
any who strayed.

26
00:03:42,608 --> 00:03:47,139
The leaf-eaters stopped only
to hatch their young.

be together always.

The land has been changing.

This way.

Aah!

210
00:17:40,286 --> 00:17:44,225
ln this time
of the clash of continents,

211
00:17:44,293 --> 00:17:46,728
an earthquake split the land.

212
00:17:46,797 --> 00:17:50,759
Herds were divided,
families were cut in two.

213
00:17:50,838 --> 00:17:53,832
Littlefoot was separated
from his grandparents.

Cera was on one side
of the divide,

217
00:18:08,736 --> 00:18:11,707
her parents
were on the other.

00:18:40,391 --> 00:18:41,416
Oh.

224
00:18:43,396 --> 00:18:44,591
Mother.

225
00:18:46,569 --> 00:18:47,502
Mother?

00:18:47,571 --> 00:18:48,538
Oh.

00:18:48,606 --> 00:18:50,872
Please get up.

228
00:18:50,943 --> 00:18:52,138
l'm...

229
00:18:53,414 --> 00:18:55,850
not sure l can, Littlefoot.

230
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,353
Yes, you can.

231
00:18:57,421 --> 00:18:58,946
Get up.

232
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,410
Dear, sweet Littlefoot,

233
00:19:10,478 --> 00:19:14,884
do you remember the way
to the Great Valley?

234
00:19:14,952 --> 00:19:16,386
l guess so,

235
00:19:16,454 --> 00:19:19,426
but why do l have to know?

236
00:19:19,494 --> 00:19:22,260
You're going to be with me.

237
00:19:22,332 --> 00:19:24,267
l'll be with you,

238
00:19:24,335 --> 00:19:27,273
even if you can't see me.

239
00:19:27,341 --> 00:19:31,781
What do you mean
if l can't see you?

240
00:19:31,848 --> 00:19:34,284
l can always see you.

241
00:19:34,353 --> 00:19:37,917
Littlefoot,
let your heart guide you.

242
00:19:39,362 --> 00:19:40,853
lt whispers.

243
00:19:41,866 --> 00:19:43,425
So listen closely.

244
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:50,811
Mother? Mother?

245
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:17,022
Mmm.

246
00:20:17,095 --> 00:20:18,255
Mmmmm.

247
00:20:20,534 --> 00:20:21,695
Hey!

248
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,208
What's going on here?

00:20:25,276 --> 00:20:26,403
[Crying]

250
00:20:26,478 --> 00:20:28,538
What's your problem?

251
00:20:28,615 --> 00:20:30,106
You're not hurt.

252
00:20:30,184 --> 00:20:32,211
lt's not fair.

253
00:20:32,288 --> 00:20:34,520
She should have known better.

254
00:20:34,592 --> 00:20:37,028
That was a sharptooth.

255
00:20:37,097 --> 00:20:39,066
lt's all her fault.

256
00:20:39,133 --> 00:20:41,103
All whose fault?

257
00:20:41,171 --> 00:20:42,264
Mother's.

258
00:20:42,339 --> 00:20:45,139
Oh...

259
00:20:46,213 --> 00:20:49,309
l see. l see.

260
00:20:49,385 --> 00:20:53,222
Why did l wander
so far from home?

261
00:20:53,292 --> 00:20:55,728
Oh, it's not your fault.

262
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,232
lt's not your mother's fault.

263
00:20:58,301 --> 00:21:01,466
You pay attention to old Rooter.

264
00:21:01,539 --> 00:21:04,670
lt is nobody's fault.

265
00:21:04,745 --> 00:21:08,148
The great circle
of life has begun,

266
00:21:08,218 --> 00:21:09,686
but, you see,

267
00:21:09,753 --> 00:21:14,160
not all of us arrive
together at the end.

268
00:21:14,229 --> 00:21:15,663
What'll l do?

269
00:21:15,731 --> 00:21:18,167
l miss her so much.

270
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:20,205
You'll always miss her,

271
00:21:20,272 --> 00:21:23,176
but she'll always be with you

272
00:21:23,245 --> 00:21:26,705
if you remember
what she taught you.

273
00:21:26,783 --> 00:21:29,185
You'll never really be apart,

274
00:21:29,255 --> 00:21:33,194
for you're still
a part of each other.

275
00:21:33,262 --> 00:21:34,856
My tummy hurts.

276

Well, that, too,
will go in time, little fella...

Littlefoot could only
think about his mother.

He hardly noticed his hunger

reach the Great Valley.

Dear Littlefoot,

do you remember the way
to the Great Valley?

296

Follow the bright circle

297
00:24:22,856 --> 00:24:27,820
past the great rock
that looks like a long-neck

298
00:24:27,898 --> 00:24:30,892
and past the mountains
that burn.

299
00:24:32,874 --> 00:24:35,902
l'll be in your heart,
Littlefoot.

00:24:36,881 --> 00:24:39,009

that he was alone

he'd have to find his way,

We'll coax him to deep water.

He can't swim
with scrawny arms.

that rock on his head.
