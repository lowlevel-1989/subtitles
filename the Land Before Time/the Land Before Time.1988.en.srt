00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,936
Once upon this same earth,

3
00:02:28,004 --> 00:02:30,441
beneath this same sun,

4
00:02:30,509 --> 00:02:32,411
long before you...

5
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,419
before the ape
and the elephant as well,

6
00:02:36,487 --> 00:02:40,449
before the wolf,
the bison, the whale,

7
00:02:40,526 --> 00:02:43,930
before the mammoth
and the mastodon

8
00:02:43,999 --> 00:02:47,028
in the time
of the dinosaurs.

9
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,941
Come on!

10
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:52,447
Dinosaurs
were of two kinds--

11
00:02:52,515 --> 00:02:57,478
Some had flat teeth
and ate the leaves of trees.

12
00:02:57,557 --> 00:03:00,994
Some had sharp teeth
for eating meat.

13
00:03:01,061 --> 00:03:03,966
They preyed upon
the leaf-eaters.

14
00:03:04,035 --> 00:03:06,470
Then leaves began to die.

15
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:10,479
The mighty beasts,
who appeared to rule earth,

16
00:03:10,546 --> 00:03:13,985
were ruled, in truth,
by the leaf.

17
00:03:14,051 --> 00:03:15,486
Desperate for food,

18
00:03:15,554 --> 00:03:17,747
some dinosaur herds
struck out toward the west,

19
00:03:17,747 --> 00:03:19,307
some dinosaur herds
struck out toward the west,

20
00:03:19,382 --> 00:03:21,820
searching for
their Great Valley,

21
00:03:21,887 --> 00:03:24,859
a land still lush and green.

22
00:03:24,926 --> 00:03:27,922
lt was a journey toward life.

23
00:03:35,445 --> 00:03:38,884
lt was a march of many dangers.

24
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:40,888
Sharpteeth stalked the herds,

25
00:03:40,955 --> 00:03:43,858
waiting to seize
any who strayed.

26
00:03:43,926 --> 00:03:48,458
The leaf-eaters stopped only
to hatch their young.

be together always.

This way.

Aah!

210
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:45,537
ln this time
of the clash of continents,

211
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:48,041
an earthquake split the land.

212
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:52,072
Herds were divided,
families were cut in two.

213
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:55,145
Littlefoot was separated
from his grandparents.

Mama! Daddy!

216
00:18:06,174 --> 00:18:09,977
Cera was on one side
of the divide,

217
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:13,020
her parents
were on the other.

00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,526

223
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:42,728
Oh.

224
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:45,904
Mother.

225
00:18:47,881 --> 00:18:48,815
Mother?

226
00:18:48,883 --> 00:18:49,851
Oh.

227
00:18:49,918 --> 00:18:52,185
Please get up.

228
00:18:52,255 --> 00:18:53,450
l'm...

229
00:18:54,727 --> 00:18:57,163
not sure l can, Littlefoot.

230
00:18:57,231 --> 00:18:58,666
Yes, you can.

231
00:18:58,733 --> 00:19:00,258
Get up.

232
00:19:09,752 --> 00:19:11,722
Dear, sweet Littlefoot,

233
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:16,196
do you remember the way
to the Great Valley?

234
00:19:16,264 --> 00:19:17,698
l guess so,

235
00:19:17,766 --> 00:19:20,738
but why do l have to know?

236
00:19:20,806 --> 00:19:23,572
You're going to be with me.

237
00:19:23,645 --> 00:19:25,579
l'll be with you,

238
00:19:25,648 --> 00:19:28,585
even if you can't see me.

239
00:19:28,654 --> 00:19:33,093
What do you mean
if l can't see you?

240
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,596
l can always see you.

241
00:19:35,664 --> 00:19:39,230
Littlefoot,
let your heart guide you.

242
00:19:40,673 --> 00:19:42,164
lt whispers.

243
00:19:43,178 --> 00:19:44,737
So listen closely.

244
00:19:49,322 --> 00:19:52,123
Mother? Mother?

245
00:20:17,071 --> 00:20:18,333
Mmm.

246
00:20:18,407 --> 00:20:19,567
Mmmmm.

247
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,007
Hey!

248
00:20:25,052 --> 00:20:26,520
What's going on here?

249
00:20:26,587 --> 00:20:27,715
[Crying]

250
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,850
What's your problem?

251
00:20:29,927 --> 00:20:31,418
You're not hurt.

252
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:33,523
lt's not fair.

253
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,832
She should have known better.

254
00:20:35,904 --> 00:20:38,341
That was a sharptooth.

255
00:20:38,409 --> 00:20:40,377
lt's all her fault.

256
00:20:40,445 --> 00:20:42,414
All whose fault?

257
00:20:42,483 --> 00:20:43,576
Mother's.

258
00:20:43,651 --> 00:20:46,451
Oh...

259
00:20:47,525 --> 00:20:50,621
l see. l see.

260
00:20:50,697 --> 00:20:54,534
Why did l wander
so far from home?

261
00:20:54,603 --> 00:20:57,040
Oh, it's not your fault.

262
00:20:57,107 --> 00:20:59,544
lt's not your mother's fault.

263
00:20:59,614 --> 00:21:02,777
You pay attention to old Rooter.

264
00:21:02,851 --> 00:21:05,981
lt is nobody's fault.

265
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:09,460
The great circle
of life has begun,

266
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:10,997
but, you see,

267
00:21:11,066 --> 00:21:15,471
not all of us arrive
together at the end.

268
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:16,975
What'll l do?

269
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:19,479
l miss her so much.

270
00:21:19,547 --> 00:21:21,517
You'll always miss her,

271
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:24,487
but she'll always be with you

272
00:21:24,556 --> 00:21:28,017
if you remember
what she taught you.

273
00:21:28,094 --> 00:21:30,497
You'll never really be apart,

274
00:21:30,567 --> 00:21:34,505
for you're still
a part of each other.

275
00:21:34,573 --> 00:21:36,168
My tummy hurts.

276
00:21:36,244 --> 00:21:40,945
Well, that, too,
will go in time, little fella...

Littlefoot could only
think about his mother.

He hardly noticed his hunger

reach the Great Valley.

Dear Littlefoot,

do you remember the way
to the Great Valley?

296

Follow the bright circle

297
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:29,131
past the great rock
that looks like a long-neck

298
00:24:29,209 --> 00:24:32,202
and past the mountains
that burn.

299
00:24:34,185 --> 00:24:37,212
l'll be in your heart,
Littlefoot.

300
00:24:38,191 --> 00:24:40,319
Let your heart guide you.

that he was alone

the Great Valley

was far away

00:25:36,293 --> 00:25:38,763
he'd have to find his way,
