OK!

16
00:08:11,311 --> 00:08:12,312
Huh?

17
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:35,460
A goldfish!

18
00:08:47,597 --> 00:08:49,265
Can't get it out.

19
00:09:06,699 --> 00:09:08,034
That was weird.

20
00:09:18,545 --> 00:09:19,546
Ow!

21
00:09:22,549 --> 00:09:24,384
It looks kind of dead.

22
00:09:28,471 --> 00:09:30,390
It licked me! It's alive!

23
00:09:33,059 --> 00:09:35,561
Sosuke, we'll be late!

24
00:09:35,645 --> 00:09:38,314
Mom, a goldfish!

25
00:09:38,398 --> 00:09:39,524
Sosuke!

26
00:09:49,617 --> 00:09:51,410
This wind is crazy.

27
00:09:51,494 --> 00:09:54,581
Sosuke, I'm starting the car now!

28
00:10:02,922 --> 00:10:04,674
Well? Have you found my daughter?

29
00:10:09,887 --> 00:10:13,433
What? She was captured by a human?

30
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:19,188
A boy! This is very bad.

31
00:10:45,006 --> 00:10:47,091
Is it already dead?

32
00:10:55,099 --> 00:10:56,768
You are alive!

33
00:11:05,985 --> 00:11:09,905
Sosuke, I have a job, you know!

34
00:11:09,989 --> 00:11:13,117
Look, Mom, I found a goldfish!

35
00:11:13,201 --> 00:11:16,996
- A goldfish?
- It was right down by the rocks.

36
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:21,459
Yeah?

37
00:11:25,588 --> 00:11:26,589
Hm?

38
00:11:42,855 --> 00:11:44,231
I don't know who you are,

39
00:11:44,315 --> 00:11:46,650
but we don't use weedkiller around here.

40
00:11:46,734 --> 00:11:51,739
Hm? What? This is not weedkiller.

41
00:11:51,823 --> 00:11:53,657
This is the purest ocean water,

42
00:11:53,741 --> 00:11:55,117
and it keeps me from drying out on land.

43
00:11:55,201 --> 00:11:58,329
Whatever.
As long as it's not weedkiller.

44
00:11:58,413 --> 00:12:00,498
- Excuse us.
- Please wait.

45
00:12:05,378 --> 00:12:07,463
Uh-oh.

46
00:12:07,547 --> 00:12:09,799
This is bad. This is very bad.

47
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,844
Wow. That guy was a freak show.

48
00:12:13,928 --> 00:12:17,640
But don't you call people "freak show."
We never judge others by their looks.

49
00:12:17,724 --> 00:12:19,224
I know, Mom. I don't.

50
00:12:19,308 --> 00:12:22,186
- Oh. Another experiment for school?
- Mm-hm.

51
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,313
Your teacher doesn't really like
show and tell.

52
00:12:24,397 --> 00:12:25,939
I think it'll be fine.

53
00:12:26,023 --> 00:12:27,983
Don't worry, I'll take good care of you.

54
00:12:28,067 --> 00:12:30,069
Huh! She sure is pretty.

55
00:12:36,075 --> 00:12:38,411
There's a ship headed for dry dock.

56
00:12:40,037 --> 00:12:42,081
Hurry up. Eat your breakfast.

57
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:46,001
I wonder if she would eat this.

58
00:12:46,085 --> 00:12:48,212
Want some?

59
00:12:49,505 --> 00:12:52,049
Hey! My cut is all gone!

60
00:12:54,761 --> 00:12:57,596
Mom, I think I'll call her Ponyo.

61
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,723
- Mmm?
- She came to me.

62
00:12:59,807 --> 00:13:01,558
She might be magic.

63
00:13:01,642 --> 00:13:05,313
I saved her.
She's my responsibility now.

64
00:13:14,989 --> 00:13:16,949
Want ham instead?

65
00:13:31,964 --> 00:13:34,341
Mom, Ponyo really likes to eat ham.

66
00:13:34,425 --> 00:13:36,052
So she thinks she's human?

67
00:13:39,388 --> 00:13:40,389
Ouch!

68
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,118
Whoa! Turn!

69
00:14:03,204 --> 00:14:05,414
Humans are disgusting!

70
00:14:05,498 --> 00:14:07,333
Come on, Lisa, hurry!

71
00:14:15,883 --> 00:14:19,387
All this waste, filth.

72
00:14:21,013 --> 00:14:23,224
Morning, Shima-san!

73
00:14:28,896 --> 00:14:31,899
Ponyo, look. You can see our house.

74
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:55,297
- Ask about the fish.
- I will.

75
00:14:55,381 --> 00:14:58,258
- Love you, Sosuke.
- Goodbye.

76
00:14:58,342 --> 00:15:00,928
Morning! Seems like I'm always late.

77
00:15:01,012 --> 00:15:03,264
- Can you get me another wheelchair?
- Sure.

78
00:15:18,487 --> 00:15:21,281
- Good morning, Sosuke.
- Excuse me.

79
00:15:21,365 --> 00:15:24,326
- I'm in a big hurry, Yoshie.
- Is that so?

80
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:27,746
- And me, Sosuke?
- Not now, Toki. I'm concentrating.

81
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:28,831
Ah...

82
00:15:35,755 --> 00:15:38,215
Maybe the teacher will get mad.

83
00:15:40,092 --> 00:15:41,218
I got it.

84
00:15:45,014 --> 00:15:48,100
You'll be safe here, Ponyo.
I'll be back soon.

85
00:15:50,186 --> 00:15:53,731
Hm. I wonder if there are
any cats around here.

86
00:16:03,366 --> 00:16:07,036
That should do it, Ponyo.
Stay put. I'll be right back.

87
00:16:14,502 --> 00:16:18,422
- See you later.
- Hello there, Toshi.

88
00:16:18,506 --> 00:16:21,049
I'll call if her cough
gets worse, but she looks fine.

89
00:16:21,133 --> 00:16:23,677
- You good, little sweetie?
- Oh, thank you. Good.

90
00:16:23,761 --> 00:16:26,763
- Bye-bye.
- Good morning, sensei.

91
00:16:26,847 --> 00:16:29,976
- Good morning, Sosuke.
- Hi, Sosuke.

92
00:16:35,564 --> 00:16:37,065
- Sosuke!
- Kumiko!

93
00:16:37,149 --> 00:16:39,568
Look at me!
My mother made me a new dress.

94
00:16:39,652 --> 00:16:41,653
- Isn't it pretty?
- Hm...

95
00:16:41,737 --> 00:16:43,864
Hey, Sosuke, let's go play.

96
00:16:43,948 --> 00:16:45,741
Can't now. I'm busy.

97
00:16:45,825 --> 00:16:47,618
You're not busy. You're five.

98
00:16:47,702 --> 00:16:51,413
- I am too! I have a job.
- You're so weird.

99
00:16:51,497 --> 00:16:53,791
Yeah. Hm!

100
00:17:06,345 --> 00:17:07,346
Oh!

101
00:17:10,307 --> 00:17:11,308
Ponyo?

102
00:17:14,103 --> 00:17:15,312
Ponyo!

103
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,279
Sosuke!

104
00:17:24,363 --> 00:17:26,782
- Oh, Kumiko.
- What is that?

105
00:17:26,866 --> 00:17:29,576
There are rules about
bringing things to school for a reason.

106
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,453
I know. This isn't school.

107
00:17:31,537 --> 00:17:33,914
These bushes are on
the senior center property.

108
00:17:33,998 --> 00:17:35,291
Let me see!

109
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:37,668
Oh, a goldfish?

110
00:17:37,752 --> 00:17:40,337
She's not just a goldfish. She's Ponyo.

111
00:17:40,421 --> 00:17:42,714
Ponyo? Let's see!

112
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:44,466
OK, but don't tell she's here.

113
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:48,387
- I won't.
- The rules are: Look but don't touch.

114
00:17:48,471 --> 00:17:50,556
Look at her. Isn't she pretty?

115
00:17:56,729 --> 00:18:01,275
That's the most boring goldfish
I've ever seen in my entire life.

116
00:18:22,755 --> 00:18:24,965
That one was Kumiko's fault.

117
00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:27,802
You should never judge others
by their looks.

118
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,349
Let's get you some more water.

119
00:18:55,121 --> 00:18:56,539
Ponyo!

120
00:19:00,626 --> 00:19:04,588
Ah! That was my fault.

121
00:19:10,136 --> 00:19:12,262
There it comes again.

122
00:19:12,346 --> 00:19:15,516
I hear old Sosuke's voice.

123
00:19:16,308 --> 00:19:19,728
But I know our boy
is in school right now.

124
00:19:19,812 --> 00:19:23,023
So it must be only in my head.

125
00:19:23,107 --> 00:19:25,317
Look, Yoshie. I'm right over here.

126
00:19:27,027 --> 00:19:29,237
Oh, that's a relief.

127
00:19:29,321 --> 00:19:31,698
I haven't lost my mind quite yet.

128
00:19:31,782 --> 00:19:33,950
Are you ready to see my big surprise?

129
00:19:34,034 --> 00:19:36,912
- What is it?
- I'll show you.

130
00:19:36,996 --> 00:19:39,539
But first, guess what color she is.

131
00:19:39,623 --> 00:19:44,044
- Hm... She... She's red!
- Red!

132
00:19:44,503 --> 00:19:45,754
That's right!

133
00:19:46,672 --> 00:19:50,175
- How did you both guess that?
- Come on, show us!

134
00:19:50,259 --> 00:19:51,927
OK.

135
00:19:54,513 --> 00:19:57,432
- Well, look!
- Very pretty.

136
00:19:57,516 --> 00:19:59,810
Her name is Ponyo. She likes to eat ham.

137
00:19:59,894 --> 00:20:02,437
And she can do magic!

138
00:20:02,521 --> 00:20:03,897
I got a cut on my thumb,

139
00:20:03,981 --> 00:20:06,942
and it went away because she licked it.

140
00:20:07,026 --> 00:20:08,944
Oh!

141
00:20:09,028 --> 00:20:12,864
Maybe she could use some of her magic
to fix my hips and back.

142
00:20:12,948 --> 00:20:16,952
I'd let a fish lick me
if it'd get me out of this wheelchair.

143
00:20:17,036 --> 00:20:20,080
Well, I don't know
about all that licking.

144
00:20:20,164 --> 00:20:23,500
- I'd have to ask Ponyo...
- Let me have a look in that green pail.

145
00:20:23,584 --> 00:20:24,877
Yes, Toki-san.

146
00:20:26,837 --> 00:20:30,424
It has a real face on it!

147
00:20:31,133 --> 00:20:35,011
Hurry up! Put it back in the ocean.
Don't you realize it'll cause a tsunami?

148
00:20:35,095 --> 00:20:38,098
Oh, you. It's always tsunami,
day and night.

149
00:20:38,766 --> 00:20:41,977
Fish with faces
who come out of the sea cause tsunamis.

150
00:20:42,061 --> 00:20:44,104
That's what they always say.

151
00:20:46,232 --> 00:20:49,317
Tsunami! Tsunami! It's here!

152
00:20:49,401 --> 00:20:54,823
Ah! Oh! Sosuke, put her back
in the ocean where she belongs!

153
00:20:57,243 --> 00:21:00,162
Toki, what's the matter?

154
00:21:00,246 --> 00:21:02,330
I'm soaking wet. Look at my clothes!

155
00:21:02,414 --> 00:21:04,214
I'm soaking wet. Look at my clothes!

156
00:21:10,422 --> 00:21:12,216
Sosuke!

157
00:21:16,762 --> 00:21:18,973
Sosuke!

158
00:21:21,308 --> 00:21:23,435
Sosuke!

159
00:21:24,895 --> 00:21:26,980
Sosuke!

160
00:21:27,064 --> 00:21:29,775
Come back here and apologize!

161
00:21:38,617 --> 00:21:42,537
Don't worry, Ponyo.
No matter what, I will protect you.

162
00:21:42,621 --> 00:21:44,372
I promise.

163
00:21:44,456 --> 00:21:45,749
Sosuke!

164
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,879
Sosuke!

165
00:21:54,883 --> 00:21:56,260
Ponyo!

166
00:21:58,637 --> 00:22:01,014
Ponyo. Sosuke.

167
00:22:01,098 --> 00:22:05,644
Ponyo loves Sosuke!

168
00:22:11,317 --> 00:22:13,026
I will love you, too.

169
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:17,740
Ponyo loves Sosuke!

170
00:22:49,813 --> 00:22:51,523
Ponyo?

171
00:22:56,487 --> 00:22:58,697
Ponyo!

172
00:22:58,781 --> 00:23:02,742
Ponyo! Ponyo!

173
00:23:02,826 --> 00:23:03,827
Ponyo!

174
00:23:06,038 --> 00:23:08,540
Ah! Ponyo! Ponyo!

175
00:23:10,209 --> 00:23:12,044
- Ponyo!
- Sosuke!

176
00:23:13,712 --> 00:23:16,631
Ponyo! Ponyo!

177
00:23:16,715 --> 00:23:18,466
Ponyo!

178
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:20,469
Ponyo!

179
00:23:21,553 --> 00:23:23,514
Ponyo!

180
00:24:16,859 --> 00:24:20,195
Listen, Sosuke, you know,
this could be for the best.

181
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:22,655
I know you tried, but Ponyo is a fish.

182
00:24:22,739 --> 00:24:26,368
She wasn't meant to live
in a bucket. The ocean is home to her.

183
00:24:26,452 --> 00:24:27,702
Anyway, let's get home.

184
00:24:27,786 --> 00:24:32,082
Hopefully, that spritzing weirdo
is gone. Whoo!

185
00:24:32,166 --> 00:24:34,084
Can I have a lick?

186
00:24:34,168 --> 00:24:37,045
Hurry, it's starting to melt.

187
00:24:39,465 --> 00:24:41,467
Dad's favorite. Me, too!

188
00:24:46,263 --> 00:24:49,891
I'm really sorry, Sosuke.
But Dad is finally coming home tonight.

189
00:24:49,975 --> 00:24:52,811
You can tell him all about Ponyo.

190
00:25:20,005 --> 00:25:23,342
- No more ocean today, OK?
- Mm-hm.

191
00:25:48,492 --> 00:25:51,661
Sosuke?

192
00:25:51,745 --> 00:25:53,788
Sosuke? Time to come in now.

193
00:25:53,872 --> 00:25:56,040
Maybe if I leave the pail,

194
00:25:56,124 --> 00:25:58,793
Ponyo will know where we live
when she comes back.

195
00:25:58,877 --> 00:26:02,297
Do that. I think that's a lovely thing
to do for Ponyo.

196
00:26:02,381 --> 00:26:04,216
Mm-hm.

197
00:26:16,436 --> 00:26:18,146
Sosuke, can you get that?

198
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:20,649
It must be your dad.

199
00:26:22,526 --> 00:26:25,487
Hello? Yep. She's fine.

200
00:26:25,571 --> 00:26:27,906
<i>- Are you at the dock?
- I caught a second run,</i>

201
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:29,991
<i>so I have to take it.
I won't be home tonight.</i>

202
00:26:30,075 --> 00:26:32,660
<i>I'll signal you when we pass.
Can you help me out with Mom?</i>

203
00:26:32,744 --> 00:26:35,497
No, you should tell her.

204
00:26:36,748 --> 00:26:39,167
Hi, honey. Uh-huh.

205
00:26:39,251 --> 00:26:41,920
What?! Too many in a row, Koichi!

206
00:26:42,004 --> 00:26:43,338
Let someone else take it!

207
00:26:43,422 --> 00:26:46,549
Go ahead, abandon your wife
and child up here on a cliff all alone.

208
00:26:46,633 --> 00:26:48,552
Oh, jerk!

209
00:26:52,389 --> 00:26:55,850
Uh! Come on, Sosuke.
Let's get out of here.

210
00:26:55,934 --> 00:26:58,770
What if Ponyo comes back?

211
00:26:59,938 --> 00:27:01,773
Mm!

212
00:27:06,695 --> 00:27:07,654
Ah!

213
00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:30,093
There's Dad. Turn off the lights, Mom.

214
00:27:30,177 --> 00:27:32,971
- Don't you wanna signal him?
- Mm-mm.

215
00:27:54,826 --> 00:27:58,037
Hey, my son is working
the signal all by himself!

216
00:27:58,121 --> 00:28:01,249
- Can you believe that?
- Your wife must be pretty mad.

217
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:05,253
S... O... R...

218
00:28:05,337 --> 00:28:07,714
...R... Y.

219
00:28:07,798 --> 00:28:11,759
- Dad says he's very sorry.
- B-U-G...

220
00:28:11,843 --> 00:28:14,178
- O-F-F.
- B...

221
00:28:14,262 --> 00:28:18,683
B-U-G O-F-F.
B-U-G O-F-F.

222
00:28:24,856 --> 00:28:26,983
Mom, Dad says he loves you.

223
00:28:27,067 --> 00:28:30,570
He says, "Lots and lots."

224
00:28:42,874 --> 00:28:46,044
Wow! Nice, Dad!

225
00:29:19,202 --> 00:29:20,953
Don't cry, Mom.

226
00:29:21,037 --> 00:29:24,582
I know Dad breaks his promises sometimes.

227
00:29:24,666 --> 00:29:27,168
But he does his best for us.

228
00:29:27,252 --> 00:29:30,129
I promised Ponyo I'd take care of her.

229
00:29:30,213 --> 00:29:32,132
Then I lost her.

230
00:29:34,384 --> 00:29:36,928
I wonder if she's crying now.

231
00:29:39,806 --> 00:29:43,018
- Ah!
- You are so good! Mmm!

232
00:29:45,061 --> 00:29:47,522
<i>♪ Happy as can be</i>

233
00:29:47,606 --> 00:29:51,317
- Mm! Ah!
- Don't you worry, Sosuke.

234
00:29:51,401 --> 00:29:55,238
You did your best
and Ponyo will be just fine.

235
00:29:55,322 --> 00:29:57,407
OK.

236
00:29:57,491 --> 00:29:59,784
I say we start with dessert
and go backwards!

237
00:29:59,868 --> 00:30:01,568
It's been a backwards kind of day.

238
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:14,132
It's not your fault.

239
00:30:14,216 --> 00:30:17,552
I exposed you to the magic
and you're too young to understand.

240
00:30:17,636 --> 00:30:21,681
I have to keep the sea in balance.
It's a great responsibility.

241
00:30:21,765 --> 00:30:23,933
You must promise me something:

242
00:30:24,017 --> 00:30:26,686
You will never go back
to the surface. Yes?

243
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:29,814
Come on, now. Eat, Brunhilde.

244
00:30:29,898 --> 00:30:32,484
I want ham!

245
00:30:34,653 --> 00:30:38,197
Ham! You ate their food.
What else did you do?

246
00:30:38,281 --> 00:30:39,907
Did you taste blood, Brunhilde?

247
00:30:39,991 --> 00:30:43,578
My name is not Brunhilde. It's Ponyo.

248
00:30:43,662 --> 00:30:48,374
- Ponyo?
- Ponyo! Ponyo loves Sosuke!

249
00:30:48,458 --> 00:30:51,377
I will be a human, too!

250
00:30:51,461 --> 00:30:54,755
Human? What do you know
about humans, Brunhilde?

251
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:56,215
They spoil the sea.

252
00:30:56,299 --> 00:30:59,760
They treat your home
like their empty, black souls.

253
00:30:59,844 --> 00:31:03,514
I was once, long ago, a human myself.

254
00:31:03,598 --> 00:31:05,766
I had to leave that all behind
to serve the Earth.

255
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:08,936
Hands! I want hands!

256
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:11,564
I don't want these flippers anymore!

257
00:31:11,648 --> 00:31:15,485
I want feet, like Sosuke!

258
00:31:15,569 --> 00:31:19,531
That's enough!

259
00:31:24,077 --> 00:31:26,954
Ah!

260
00:31:27,038 --> 00:31:28,957
Oh!

261
00:31:36,214 --> 00:31:39,800
I made hands! I made feet, too! Ha!

262
00:31:39,884 --> 00:31:42,470
- Yes!
- What? No, no!

263
00:31:42,554 --> 00:31:44,972
Don't tell me.
You have tasted human blood!

264
00:31:45,056 --> 00:31:46,682
I'm going to Sosuke!

265
00:31:46,766 --> 00:31:48,684
Enough!
You're making a terrible mistake!

266
00:31:48,768 --> 00:31:51,479
Don't do it! Stop it. Stop it!
Stop changing now.

267
00:31:51,563 --> 00:31:55,191
Revert. Revert. Revert! Revert!

268
00:31:55,275 --> 00:31:57,652
Revert!

269
00:31:57,736 --> 00:32:01,489
Stop it, stop it,
stop it, stop it, stop it!

270
00:32:01,573 --> 00:32:05,660
Don't change!

271
00:32:05,744 --> 00:32:08,830
I need more power!

272
00:32:10,624 --> 00:32:13,376
Let me out! Let me out!

273
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:17,380
Let me out!

274
00:32:17,464 --> 00:32:20,341
I want to see Sosuke! Let me go!

275
00:32:20,425 --> 00:32:23,427
Let me out!

276
00:32:23,511 --> 00:32:26,264
You can't be human and magic
at the same time, sweetheart.

277
00:32:26,348 --> 00:32:29,351
Be still, be still,
be still, be still, be still.

278
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:40,444
She's already so powerful.

279
00:32:40,528 --> 00:32:42,447
Just like her mother.

280
00:32:47,285 --> 00:32:51,122
If you could only remain
innocent and pure forever.

281
00:33:11,309 --> 00:33:14,979
I don't have the power
to hold her for very long.

282
00:33:15,063 --> 00:33:17,356
I need to ask for her mother's help now.

283
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,483
I... What?

284
00:33:26,866 --> 00:33:29,368
Huh! They're headed for my elixirs.

285
00:33:29,452 --> 00:33:31,912
Shoo! Shoo!
Get out of here! Shoo!

286
00:33:31,996 --> 00:33:34,415
That was too close.

287
00:33:34,499 --> 00:33:37,710
I must be careful not to upset
the balance of nature.

288
00:33:37,794 --> 00:33:39,837
Calm. I must remain calm.

289
00:33:39,921 --> 00:33:42,840
When I think of leaving her again,
my heart won't stop pounding.

290
00:33:42,924 --> 00:33:45,217
Right, then. Focus on work.

291
00:33:45,301 --> 00:33:47,011
This batch should be ready.

292
00:33:55,228 --> 00:33:57,939
At least there aren't leaks down here.

293
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:05,697
This door still doesn't fit right.

294
00:34:08,867 --> 00:34:10,994
I'll fix that next.

295
00:34:17,208 --> 00:34:20,462
If even one living creature
got in here...

296
00:34:44,235 --> 00:34:47,154
Ah, yes.
I can feel the power of the ocean

297
00:34:47,238 --> 00:34:50,157
in the furthest reaches of my DNA.

298
00:34:50,241 --> 00:34:52,034
When this well is full,

299
00:34:52,118 --> 00:34:55,079
then the age of the ocean
will begin again.

300
00:34:55,163 --> 00:34:58,165
An explosion of life
to match the Cambrian age.

301
00:34:58,249 --> 00:35:01,628
An end to the era
of those abominable humans.

302
00:35:05,924 --> 00:35:08,301
This cursed door!

303
00:36:31,843 --> 00:36:33,428
Teeth!

304
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:43,855
Let's find Sosuke!

305
00:38:51,357 --> 00:38:55,445
I'm free!

306
00:39:14,964 --> 00:39:17,842
- Waterspout!
- Captain, look over there!

307
00:39:20,595 --> 00:39:24,974
- It must be a tsunami!
- Turn the ship into the wave!

308
00:39:25,058 --> 00:39:28,186
Look! What is that?

309
00:39:33,191 --> 00:39:36,235
Captain, all our instruments
just went dead!

310
00:39:39,697 --> 00:39:43,367
It's a little girl.
Looks like she's about Sosuke's age.

311
00:39:56,881 --> 00:40:00,718
- Thanks again.
- Sure. See you tomorrow.

312
00:40:00,802 --> 00:40:02,302
It's raining so hard, Sosuke.

313
00:40:02,386 --> 00:40:04,346
I'll call your mother
and have her pick you up.

314
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:07,391
That's all right. I'll take
the shortcut. Goodbye, sensei.

315
00:40:07,475 --> 00:40:11,604
Bye, Sosuke. Be careful out there.

316
00:40:53,563 --> 00:40:55,731
Sosuke, I'm sorry.

317
00:40:55,815 --> 00:40:58,692
The door didn't open, right?
The power just went out.

318
00:40:58,776 --> 00:41:00,611
- Everything OK at school?
- Mm-hm.

319
00:41:00,695 --> 00:41:04,198
Lisa, if your shift's over,
you can go home.

320
00:41:04,282 --> 00:41:05,574
Sure you don't need my help?

321
00:41:05,658 --> 00:41:08,368
Don't worry. We'll be fine.

322
00:41:08,452 --> 00:41:11,330
A little rain storm
keeps the seniors entertained.

323
00:41:11,414 --> 00:41:14,708
If I were you, I'd get out of here
while you still can.

324
00:41:14,792 --> 00:41:17,252
Wait here, sweetie. I'll be right back.

325
00:41:17,336 --> 00:41:18,880
OK.

326
00:41:29,056 --> 00:41:31,308
Hi, Yoshie.

327
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:34,019
Oh, Sosuke. Is that you?

328
00:41:34,103 --> 00:41:36,105
It's so dark I can barely see.

329
00:41:36,189 --> 00:41:39,025
Here, Yoshie. I made this for you.

330
00:41:40,693 --> 00:41:43,946
Oh! What do we have here?

331
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:45,739
There's one for you, too, Noriko.

332
00:41:45,823 --> 00:41:47,533
Thank you, Sosuke.

333
00:41:47,617 --> 00:41:51,411
I can't see a thing.
I don't know why we're still here.

334
00:41:51,495 --> 00:41:56,834
It's just a little rain.
I wanna go back to my own house.

335
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:01,672
There we go. That's more like it.

336
00:42:01,756 --> 00:42:04,591
Let's see. Your goldfish!

337
00:42:04,675 --> 00:42:08,929
I bet the lights came back on
because Sosuke's here.

338
00:42:09,013 --> 00:42:12,099
<i>They're now calling the bizarre event
a micro-typhoon.</i>

339
00:42:12,183 --> 00:42:14,852
<i>Ship...</i>

340
00:42:15,853 --> 00:42:17,646
Ah, this stupid TV.

341
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:20,274
Nobody understands weather anymore.

342
00:42:20,358 --> 00:42:22,901
Might as well look at shadows
and listen to crickets.

343
00:42:22,985 --> 00:42:24,945
You should take your mother home now.

344
00:42:25,029 --> 00:42:28,157
With our lucky goldfish
to keep us company,

345
00:42:28,241 --> 00:42:31,118
- we'll be just fine.
- OK.

346
00:42:31,202 --> 00:42:34,496
<i>...landslides,
flooding and tidal surges.</i>

347
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:37,458
<i>People trying to evacuate...</i>

348
00:42:39,085 --> 00:42:41,379
This is for you, Toki.

349
00:42:44,423 --> 00:42:47,968
I can't tell. What is it? It's wrinkled.

350
00:42:48,052 --> 00:42:49,053
It goes like this.

351
00:42:51,639 --> 00:42:53,807
I got it. It's a grasshopper.

352
00:42:53,891 --> 00:42:55,893
No, it's the <i>Koganei Maru.</i>

353
00:42:55,977 --> 00:42:58,979
That's the name of your father's ship,
isn't it, Sosuke?

354
00:42:59,063 --> 00:43:02,107
- Mm-hm.
- Now, it looks like a party hat.

355
00:43:02,191 --> 00:43:04,651
Sosuke, we've gotta get on the road.

356
00:43:04,735 --> 00:43:06,361
Let's hurry now and say goodbye.

357
00:43:06,445 --> 00:43:10,824
OK. Ladies, good evening.

358
00:43:10,908 --> 00:43:13,535
Good evening, Mr. Sosuke.

359
00:43:13,619 --> 00:43:16,205
Be careful the wind
doesn't blow you away.

360
00:43:17,164 --> 00:43:18,958
Let's go. Slide in.

361
00:43:22,878 --> 00:43:25,589
They said the phones are out, too.

362
00:43:48,821 --> 00:43:50,948
The ocean looks all puffed up.

363
00:43:55,161 --> 00:43:57,579
You think the storm could sink the ships?

364
00:43:57,663 --> 00:44:00,374
No. Ships can handle a storm.
They go out to sea.

365
00:44:00,458 --> 00:44:02,508
That's what your father's doing
right now.

366
00:44:13,763 --> 00:44:16,223
I saw a fish! Did you see that, Mom?

367
00:44:16,307 --> 00:44:17,558
Put your seatbelt on!

368
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:30,570
Hold on, Lisa! You can't cross here!

369
00:44:30,654 --> 00:44:33,407
We've just gotten word.
They're gonna evacuate this side.

370
00:44:33,491 --> 00:44:34,908
It's not mandatory.

371
00:44:34,992 --> 00:44:36,785
There are some people
up at the senior center.

372
00:44:36,869 --> 00:44:38,036
You should get them out.

373
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,955
They're fine.
They're on the leeward side.

374
00:44:40,039 --> 00:44:42,082
You need to go back
and seek shelter there.

375
00:44:42,166 --> 00:44:45,544
OK. But right now, I need to get home.

376
00:44:45,628 --> 00:44:48,328
- Well, you can't cross here.
- Take the mountain road.

377
00:44:51,384 --> 00:44:53,177
- Hold on, kiddo.
- Mm!

378
00:44:54,512 --> 00:44:56,054
No! Stop! Don't do it!

379
00:44:56,138 --> 00:44:57,388
Watch out! Here it comes!

380
00:45:03,145 --> 00:45:06,023
Lisa, you gotta get out of here!

381
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:18,994
Hold on.

382
00:45:46,564 --> 00:45:48,482
The fish are following us now!

383
00:45:48,566 --> 00:45:50,067
Turn around. Sit down.

384
00:45:59,285 --> 00:46:00,952
Ah!

385
00:46:01,036 --> 00:46:02,037
Ah!

386
00:46:03,456 --> 00:46:05,458
Try to hang on to something!

387
00:46:57,468 --> 00:46:59,386
That wave is just after us.

388
00:47:09,813 --> 00:47:11,940
- Mom, the little girl just fell in!
- What?

389
00:47:12,024 --> 00:47:13,974
She was running on a fish and she fell!

390
00:47:18,948 --> 00:47:20,533
Where?

391
00:47:28,749 --> 00:47:30,917
I've never seen the ocean like this.

392
00:47:31,001 --> 00:47:33,086
Sosuke, where did you see a little girl?

393
00:47:33,170 --> 00:47:35,922
She was out there,
running on top of a huge fish!

394
00:47:36,006 --> 00:47:37,216
That's impossible.

395
00:47:41,971 --> 00:47:43,180
Sosuke, we have to go!

396
00:47:59,029 --> 00:48:01,281
It's OK.
There was no little girl out there.

397
00:48:01,365 --> 00:48:02,533
We're almost home.

398
00:48:56,754 --> 00:48:59,839
There is a little girl. Come over here!

399
00:48:59,923 --> 00:49:02,008
We'll help you! Come here!

400
00:49:02,092 --> 00:49:03,218
Stay there, Sosuke.

401
00:49:11,101 --> 00:49:12,102
What?

402
00:49:29,536 --> 00:49:31,580
Sosuke, do you know her?

403
00:49:53,143 --> 00:49:57,355
- Ponyo?
- Mm-hm! It's me, Ponyo!

404
00:49:57,439 --> 00:50:00,900
It is you!

405
00:50:00,984 --> 00:50:05,530
Mom! Ponyo came back
and she's a little girl now!

406
00:50:05,614 --> 00:50:07,366
Who?

407
00:50:15,666 --> 00:50:18,085
I found Sosuke!

408
00:50:36,687 --> 00:50:42,108
All right. Sosuke, Ponyo,
life is mysterious and amazing.

409
00:50:42,192 --> 00:50:43,902
But we have work to do now.

410
00:50:43,986 --> 00:50:46,613
And I need both of you to stay calm.

411
00:50:46,697 --> 00:50:48,365
Me, too.

412
00:50:51,034 --> 00:50:53,995
You can take off
your rain coat now, Sosuke.

413
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:57,040
I've got a job for you, Ponyo.
Will you hold the light?

414
00:50:59,793 --> 00:51:04,131
- Huh?
- Stay here, and I'll go get a towel.

415
00:51:20,606 --> 00:51:23,817
Here, this way!

416
00:51:23,901 --> 00:51:26,779
Smells like you in here!

417
00:51:29,573 --> 00:51:31,784
- Ow!
- Ponyo!

418
00:51:35,662 --> 00:51:37,622
- Oof!
- There, got ya.

419
00:51:37,706 --> 00:51:39,792
Now, let's rub you down and dry you off.

420
00:51:43,545 --> 00:51:46,840
Look at that pretty red hair.
It's almost dry.

421
00:51:46,924 --> 00:51:48,925
- Huh!
- Huh?

422
00:51:49,009 --> 00:51:50,552
And your clothes are dry.

423
00:51:50,636 --> 00:51:53,513
That's because Ponyo was a fish, Mom.

424
00:51:53,597 --> 00:51:57,892
- Water can't make her wet.
- Mm-hm.

425
00:51:57,976 --> 00:52:00,562
I really like this thing.

426
00:52:00,646 --> 00:52:04,065
So let's calm ourselves down
with a hot drink.

427
00:52:04,149 --> 00:52:06,943
Ponyo, will you hold the light for me?

428
00:52:07,027 --> 00:52:09,028
- Coming!
- OK.

429
00:52:09,112 --> 00:52:12,031
- Who wants to bet the water is working?
- I do!

430
00:52:12,115 --> 00:52:13,283
I do!

431
00:52:16,078 --> 00:52:19,205
- Water!
- Water!

432
00:52:19,289 --> 00:52:22,084
We have our own water tank
outside in the yard.

433
00:52:23,794 --> 00:52:25,587
And who thinks the stove will light?

434
00:52:25,671 --> 00:52:28,339
And light! All right.

435
00:52:28,423 --> 00:52:31,802
- All right!
- We have our own propane tank.

436
00:52:34,555 --> 00:52:37,932
- OK. Let's all sit at the table.
- OK!

437
00:52:38,016 --> 00:52:40,769
Ponyo, the table's over here.

438
00:52:45,649 --> 00:52:47,651
Now, sit down like this.

439
00:52:50,654 --> 00:52:52,489
Now, put your stuff down.

440
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:58,287
- You need to use your hands.
- No, I'll use feet!

441
00:53:01,206 --> 00:53:03,000
Look at that!

442
00:53:05,335 --> 00:53:07,629
Uh... what are you guys doing?

443
00:53:07,713 --> 00:53:10,799
Look at her feet.
They're just like hands.

444
00:53:30,235 --> 00:53:32,529
Here you go.

445
00:53:32,613 --> 00:53:34,364
It's hot.

446
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:41,079
This is the best.

447
00:53:57,638 --> 00:53:59,097
Mm!

448
00:54:24,122 --> 00:54:25,916
Hm...

449
00:54:28,919 --> 00:54:31,629
That hit the spot.

450
00:54:31,713 --> 00:54:34,674
So, what would the two of you
like to do now?

451
00:54:34,758 --> 00:54:36,634
Ponyo wants ham!

452
00:54:36,718 --> 00:54:39,971
All she thinks about is ham, Mom.

453
00:54:40,055 --> 00:54:42,724
I better make some dinner then.

454
00:54:42,808 --> 00:54:45,769
First, we should start the generator
so we can call Koichi.

455
00:54:47,104 --> 00:54:50,857
That's my dad. We need power
to talk to him on the radio.

456
00:54:51,608 --> 00:54:53,985
He's out at sea right now,
but he'll be fine.

457
00:54:54,069 --> 00:54:57,030
- Is he an evil wizard?
- No, of course not.

458
00:54:57,114 --> 00:54:59,532
He's the captain of a ship.

459
00:54:59,616 --> 00:55:01,993
So, Ponyo, what's your dad like?

460
00:55:02,077 --> 00:55:05,622
He hates humans!
He keeps me in a bubble!

461
00:55:05,706 --> 00:55:08,207
- Huh?
- So I swam away from home.

462
00:55:08,291 --> 00:55:09,584
Huh?

463
00:55:09,668 --> 00:55:11,586
So, what's your mother like then?

464
00:55:11,670 --> 00:55:15,381
She's big and beautiful!

465
00:55:15,465 --> 00:55:19,511
- But she can be very scary.
- Just like my mom.

466
00:55:24,349 --> 00:55:26,351
Ponyo, over here, please.

467
00:55:39,948 --> 00:55:42,450
Mm!

468
00:55:42,534 --> 00:55:45,244
Looks like something must have
gone wrong with the fuel line.

469
00:55:45,328 --> 00:55:48,581
- Maybe it's clogged.
- It's clogged.

470
00:55:48,665 --> 00:55:50,834
It's clogged over there.

471
00:56:05,849 --> 00:56:10,895
- It's on!
- It's light now! Yeah!

472
00:56:10,979 --> 00:56:13,148
Ponyo, you're amazing.

473
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:33,626
- Antenna, antenna!
- Hey, Mom.

474
00:56:33,710 --> 00:56:35,712
Did all the ships out there sink?

475
00:56:37,089 --> 00:56:39,424
I don't see any lights out there.

476
00:56:43,762 --> 00:56:45,430
All right.

477
00:56:57,234 --> 00:57:00,153
- Too loud!
- What's wrong?

478
00:57:00,237 --> 00:57:04,741
I can't get any reception.
That's really weird.

479
00:57:04,825 --> 00:57:09,162
Transmitting from JA4LL. JA4LL.

480
00:57:09,246 --> 00:57:10,663
<i>Come in, Koichi.</i>

481
00:57:10,747 --> 00:57:13,416
<i>This is Lisa, Sosuke and Ponyo.</i>

482
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:16,169
<i>We wanted you to know
that we're all doing fine.</i>

483
00:57:16,253 --> 00:57:19,922
I'm taking care of everyone, Dad!

484
00:57:20,006 --> 00:57:21,216
Ham!

485
00:57:29,474 --> 00:57:32,018
Got your noodles all ready?

486
00:57:32,102 --> 00:57:33,854
Be careful. It's really hot.

487
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:50,870
You have to wait a little bit.

488
00:57:50,954 --> 00:57:53,498
It takes three minutes.

489
00:58:07,470 --> 00:58:09,722
OK, close your eyes.

490
00:58:09,806 --> 00:58:12,100
Keep 'em shut.

491
00:58:14,352 --> 00:58:17,606
Ponyo, uh! No peeking!

492
00:58:19,983 --> 00:58:22,485
Get ready to look now.

493
00:58:22,569 --> 00:58:27,324
Abracadabra!

494
00:58:29,868 --> 00:58:31,285
Mm!

495
00:58:31,369 --> 00:58:34,539
- It's ham!
- Careful, it's hot.

496
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:38,210
Oh! Hot, hot, hot!

497
00:58:41,838 --> 00:58:43,924
Mm...

498
00:58:55,477 --> 00:58:58,021
Mom, Ponyo fell asleep.

499
00:59:04,736 --> 00:59:07,446
Do you think Ponyo
came from far, far away?

500
00:59:07,530 --> 00:59:09,574
Yeah, I do.

501
00:59:24,714 --> 00:59:28,009
Look outside. It looks like
the waves have calmed down.

502
00:59:28,093 --> 00:59:30,803
Maybe because Ponyo fell asleep.

503
00:59:30,887 --> 00:59:32,222
Do you see that light?

504
00:59:39,229 --> 00:59:42,773
It's moving. There must be
somebody still over there.

505
00:59:42,857 --> 00:59:44,901
That's the senior center.

506
00:59:51,408 --> 00:59:54,035
- I don't see it now.
- Did they evacuate?

507
00:59:54,119 --> 00:59:56,246
I'm worried about the seniors.

508
00:59:57,998 --> 01:00:00,542
Sosuke, stay with Ponyo, OK?

509
01:00:11,594 --> 01:00:13,054
I've gotta go help them.

510
01:00:13,138 --> 01:00:15,557
I can get there
if I take the mountain road.

511
01:00:18,435 --> 01:00:20,853
Sosuke, I should go to the senior center.

512
01:00:20,937 --> 01:00:22,188
I'm coming, too.

513
01:00:22,272 --> 01:00:25,483
I'd feel better if you stay up here.

514
01:00:25,567 --> 01:00:29,028
But why can't I come? We'll wake up
Ponyo and take her with us.

515
01:00:29,112 --> 01:00:31,281
I wanna go with you!

516
01:00:33,408 --> 01:00:37,203
Sosuke, right now,
our house is a beacon in the storm.

517
01:00:37,287 --> 01:00:39,705
Our light can be seen
by the town and by the ships,

518
01:00:39,789 --> 01:00:41,582
and every place else is dark.

519
01:00:41,666 --> 01:00:43,501
You know I need to help the old people.

520
01:00:43,585 --> 01:00:46,712
So I'm going to leave you here in charge.

521
01:00:46,796 --> 01:00:49,215
You'll do the right thing. I know it.

522
01:00:49,299 --> 01:00:51,801
You have to be
the man of the house tonight.

523
01:00:51,885 --> 01:00:54,220
Let Ponyo sleep, wait for me.

524
01:00:54,304 --> 01:00:56,889
You're only five, but you're very smart.

525
01:00:56,973 --> 01:01:00,017
Sometimes, we take a leap. Be brave.

526
01:01:00,101 --> 01:01:01,811
You can do it, and I'll be back.

527
01:01:03,313 --> 01:01:04,314
Promise?

528
01:01:05,815 --> 01:01:09,568
- I promise.
- You promised.

529
01:01:09,652 --> 01:01:11,237
I love you, Sosuke.

530
01:02:06,292 --> 01:02:09,503
Captain, I can see the lights
of a city up ahead.

531
01:02:09,587 --> 01:02:12,673
Finally, we can get our bearings again.

532
01:02:12,757 --> 01:02:15,551
We're some place I've never seen before.

533
01:02:15,635 --> 01:02:18,596
Did the storm blow us to China?

534
01:02:20,765 --> 01:02:24,060
What mountains are those?
I have no idea where we are.

535
01:02:30,859 --> 01:02:33,778
That is a huge wall of water.

536
01:02:33,862 --> 01:02:36,322
Why is the moon so close?

537
01:02:39,993 --> 01:02:40,993
Hm...

538
01:02:41,077 --> 01:02:43,162
That's no mountain we're looking at.

539
01:02:43,246 --> 01:02:44,997
And that's no town, either.

540
01:02:45,081 --> 01:02:46,791
Those lights are ships.

541
01:02:57,093 --> 01:02:58,636
The moon is so close,

542
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:01,722
its gravity is forcing the ocean to rise.

543
01:03:01,806 --> 01:03:04,559
What's going on here?

544
01:03:09,772 --> 01:03:12,858
- The engine stopped!
- Try to hold her steady.

545
01:03:12,942 --> 01:03:15,445
- Arai, drop the sea anchor.
- Yes, sir.

546
01:03:28,875 --> 01:03:30,752
Something's coming this way.

547
01:03:57,237 --> 01:04:00,114
I just saw the Goddess of Mercy!

548
01:04:00,198 --> 01:04:01,491
Ah!

549
01:04:10,792 --> 01:04:13,294
- The engine's working.
- It was her.

550
01:04:13,378 --> 01:04:16,547
So you saw her, too?
I thought maybe I was hallucinating.

551
01:04:16,631 --> 01:04:19,467
Thank you for protecting us...

552
01:04:47,453 --> 01:04:50,415
Higher, higher.

553
01:04:55,503 --> 01:04:56,713
Huh?!

554
01:05:02,176 --> 01:05:05,304
That has a powerful spell on it.

555
01:05:05,388 --> 01:05:07,682
How has she learned
to do something like that?

556
01:05:24,616 --> 01:05:27,117
What? I can't believe it! No!

557
01:05:27,201 --> 01:05:31,038
She's turned into a human!
Whoa! Hold still!

558
01:05:31,122 --> 01:05:34,458
You... What are you doing?

559
01:05:34,542 --> 01:05:40,130
Hold still!

560
01:05:40,214 --> 01:05:42,841
Girls! Girls... Whoa!

561
01:05:42,925 --> 01:05:45,844
Stop, stop! Please!

562
01:05:45,928 --> 01:05:48,305
Stop now! No! Stop! Ah!

563
01:05:48,389 --> 01:05:50,683
Respect your father!

564
01:05:55,229 --> 01:05:58,316
This was serious.
I'm trying to save your sister.

565
01:06:03,655 --> 01:06:06,699
At last, she has finally come.

566
01:06:43,319 --> 01:06:47,781
- Fujimoto.
- It's been a long time, my love.

567
01:06:47,865 --> 01:06:50,159
Look at my ocean.

568
01:06:53,621 --> 01:06:55,080
Something has changed.

569
01:06:55,164 --> 01:06:58,709
It's like my ancient Devonian Sea,
full of magic and power.

570
01:06:58,793 --> 01:07:01,420
You're going to be very upset, my dear.

571
01:07:01,504 --> 01:07:04,757
Ponyo got into my elixirs,
and she has tasted human blood.

572
01:07:04,841 --> 01:07:09,846
Ponyo? What a lovely name.

573
01:07:12,348 --> 01:07:14,767
Hm.

574
01:07:14,851 --> 01:07:16,769
Of course, it's all my fault, really.

575
01:07:16,853 --> 01:07:18,729
She's become so powerful

576
01:07:18,813 --> 01:07:21,899
that she's opened a hole
in the fabric of reality.

577
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:24,610
She's too young to understand,
and she wouldn't listen to me.

578
01:07:24,694 --> 01:07:28,280
She's now a little girl.
And she loves a little boy.

579
01:07:28,364 --> 01:07:30,407
And the whole world is out of balance.

580
01:07:30,491 --> 01:07:34,953
Please, please, remove the human
in her, or the planet is doomed.

581
01:07:35,037 --> 01:07:37,707
Huh?

582
01:07:43,588 --> 01:07:46,799
Already the Earth
is pulling satellites from the sky.

583
01:07:46,883 --> 01:07:49,469
And the moon pulls the sea closer...

584
01:07:50,219 --> 01:07:52,555
Be calm, dear.

585
01:07:59,479 --> 01:08:03,524
Sosuke. The boy's name is Sosuke.

586
01:08:06,444 --> 01:08:10,907
We love your sister,
and we all want her to be happy.

587
01:08:14,035 --> 01:08:18,205
Listen, my darling, why don't we
let Ponyo become human for good?

588
01:08:18,289 --> 01:08:21,333
We must test the boy.
If Sosuke's love is true,

589
01:08:21,417 --> 01:08:23,585
Ponyo will be permanently transformed

590
01:08:23,669 --> 01:08:25,671
and the balance of nature
will be restored.

591
01:08:25,755 --> 01:08:30,008
But if his love isn't real,
then Ponyo will turn into sea foam.

592
01:08:30,092 --> 01:08:34,221
True. That is where
we all originated, my darling.

593
01:08:34,305 --> 01:08:36,473
The boy is so young, so innocent.

594
01:08:36,557 --> 01:08:38,935
- What does...?
- Shh.

595
01:08:42,688 --> 01:08:44,898
Let them sleep.

596
01:08:44,982 --> 01:08:46,901
They'll need their rest.

597
01:08:58,746 --> 01:09:00,456
Sosuke!

598
01:09:02,083 --> 01:09:05,795
Sosuke!

599
01:09:08,464 --> 01:09:10,215
Ponyo, you OK?

600
01:09:10,299 --> 01:09:13,344
Good morning, Sosuke.

601
01:09:16,347 --> 01:09:18,891
Huh?

602
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:21,686
Look at that. The ocean is at our door.

603
01:09:44,667 --> 01:09:46,877
How come your mom's not here?

604
01:09:46,961 --> 01:09:50,297
The water's so high. She must be stuck.

605
01:09:50,381 --> 01:09:52,383
Too bad we don't have a boat.

606
01:09:55,177 --> 01:09:56,888
There's a boat, right there!

607
01:09:58,931 --> 01:10:02,059
- It's a little small.
- No, it's not.

608
01:10:09,108 --> 01:10:11,027
Ah!

609
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:17,866
Uh! Huh?

610
01:10:17,950 --> 01:10:19,619
Thank you!

611
01:10:21,037 --> 01:10:24,206
Wow! You even made
the candle bigger.

612
01:10:24,290 --> 01:10:26,750
- We can fit!
- This is fantastic.

613
01:10:26,834 --> 01:10:29,419
- Fantastic!
- You take that end, please.

614
01:10:29,503 --> 01:10:30,755
OK!

615
01:10:33,132 --> 01:10:35,634
- Ready?
- Let's go!

616
01:10:35,718 --> 01:10:37,427
Whoa!

617
01:10:37,511 --> 01:10:40,472
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

618
01:10:40,556 --> 01:10:42,433
Ah!

619
01:10:48,230 --> 01:10:51,484
It actually floats!

620
01:10:53,569 --> 01:10:55,779
Doesn't look like it has any leaks.

621
01:10:55,863 --> 01:10:58,115
Now, we have to fill the boiler.

622
01:10:58,199 --> 01:11:01,285
The water gets sucked in
through this pipe.

623
01:11:01,369 --> 01:11:04,288
Then it gets heated up
here in this round thing.

624
01:11:29,939 --> 01:11:33,275
Well, that worked.

625
01:11:40,449 --> 01:11:42,117
Looks like everything's shipshape.

626
01:11:42,201 --> 01:11:44,119
- Shipshape!
- Yep.

627
01:11:44,203 --> 01:11:46,538
- Shipshape!
- Shipshape.

628
01:11:46,622 --> 01:11:50,042
Shipshape! Shipshape!
Shipshape! Shipshape!

629
01:11:50,126 --> 01:11:51,127
Shipshape!

630
01:12:11,814 --> 01:12:14,817
What's that?

631
01:12:18,779 --> 01:12:20,823
- Ow!
- Ow!

632
01:12:24,493 --> 01:12:27,245
- Look at that!
- It's burning.

633
01:12:27,329 --> 01:12:30,666
It's hot! It's hot! It's hot! It's hot!

634
01:12:38,132 --> 01:12:40,885
- Is it working?
- Hm...

635
01:12:50,728 --> 01:12:52,897
It's working!

636
01:12:53,856 --> 01:12:56,775
Sosuke, we're shipshape, right?

637
01:12:56,859 --> 01:12:58,110
- Yep.
- This is a good boat.

638
01:12:58,194 --> 01:12:59,069
Mm-hm.

639
01:12:59,153 --> 01:12:59,986
Mm-hm.

640
01:13:03,199 --> 01:13:05,117
Ah!

641
01:13:06,619 --> 01:13:09,663
- Hey, Sosuke! Look at me!
- Mm-hm.

642
01:13:09,747 --> 01:13:12,499
- Hey, this is even more fun!
- Mm-hm.

643
01:13:12,583 --> 01:13:15,127
That thing makes my nose hot.

644
01:13:15,211 --> 01:13:17,796
Ponyo, you be the boat's lookout.

645
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:22,218
- And I'll do the steering, OK?
- Mm-hm. I'm the lookout!

646
01:13:48,786 --> 01:13:50,328
There's the road.

647
01:13:50,412 --> 01:13:52,623
That's the road my mom took last night.

648
01:13:55,084 --> 01:13:58,003
- I don't see her anywhere.
- We'll see her.

649
01:13:58,087 --> 01:14:00,422
She promised me she'd come back.

650
01:14:04,969 --> 01:14:08,638
Those are ancient fish.
They lived during the Devonian Age.

651
01:14:08,722 --> 01:14:12,268
I know that one. It's Bothriocephalus.

652
01:14:14,770 --> 01:14:18,065
- And that one is...
- Dipnorhynchus.

653
01:14:18,149 --> 01:14:19,858
Dipnorhynchus!

654
01:14:19,942 --> 01:14:22,652
Wow! That one's really huge!

655
01:14:22,736 --> 01:14:25,781
- That's Devonynchus!
- Devonynchus!

656
01:14:32,454 --> 01:14:34,790
Ahoy!

657
01:14:34,874 --> 01:14:37,542
Ahoy!

658
01:14:37,626 --> 01:14:39,545
- Ahoy...
- Whoa, there's a boat!

659
01:14:40,296 --> 01:14:42,298
Ahoy!

660
01:14:43,591 --> 01:14:46,093
I'm gonna say that.

661
01:14:46,177 --> 01:14:48,345
Ahoy!

662
01:14:50,097 --> 01:14:51,557
Ow!

663
01:14:53,475 --> 01:14:55,561
Whoa, that's fast!

664
01:14:57,479 --> 01:14:59,982
- Hey!
- I'm getting the hang of this.

665
01:15:03,527 --> 01:15:05,321
Get ready to stop, Ponyo.

666
01:15:11,452 --> 01:15:13,578
- Hello, you two.
- Hello.

667
01:15:13,662 --> 01:15:16,581
Hey, that is quite a boat you got there.

668
01:15:16,665 --> 01:15:19,709
I've seen you before.
You're Lisa's little boy, aren't you?

669
01:15:19,793 --> 01:15:22,587
He's not a little boy. He's Sosuke!

670
01:15:22,671 --> 01:15:24,173
She's Ponyo.

671
01:15:25,090 --> 01:15:27,300
And I used to be a fish.

672
01:15:27,384 --> 01:15:29,928
Is that right?

673
01:15:30,012 --> 01:15:31,805
I like your name, Ponyo. It's cute.

674
01:15:31,889 --> 01:15:34,015
Mm-hm.

675
01:15:34,099 --> 01:15:36,434
By the way, have you seen my mom?

676
01:15:36,518 --> 01:15:39,938
Your mother?
Why isn't your mother with you?

677
01:15:40,022 --> 01:15:42,983
- She went to the senior center.
- Wow, way up there?

678
01:15:43,067 --> 01:15:44,902
My baby likes you.

679
01:16:12,429 --> 01:16:16,475
Oh, sweetheart.

680
01:16:23,065 --> 01:16:25,484
Oh, is that for us?

681
01:16:38,580 --> 01:16:40,791
Can I have the cup?

682
01:16:45,254 --> 01:16:48,674
Well, thank you. It smells good.

683
01:16:51,593 --> 01:16:54,471
Wow, that's good soup. Thanks.

684
01:16:54,555 --> 01:16:58,725
- My mom made it from scratch.
- The soup's for him!

685
01:16:58,809 --> 01:17:02,520
Oh, I'm sorry. He's a little too young.

686
01:17:02,604 --> 01:17:04,731
He can only drink milk at this age.

687
01:17:04,815 --> 01:17:06,441
But I could eat the soup instead,

688
01:17:06,525 --> 01:17:08,735
and it would help me
to make milk for him.

689
01:17:08,819 --> 01:17:10,654
Huh?

690
01:17:10,738 --> 01:17:13,240
Yeah, my mom made milk for me, too.

691
01:17:13,324 --> 01:17:17,869
Ponyo, what do you say?
Is it all right if I eat the soup?

692
01:17:17,953 --> 01:17:20,372
- That's fine.
- Thank you, sweetheart.

693
01:17:20,456 --> 01:17:24,126
Huh?

694
01:17:37,890 --> 01:17:41,768
People from the town!
It's just like a parade!

695
01:17:41,852 --> 01:17:46,690
Ahoy! Are any of you
in need of assistance at this time?

696
01:17:46,774 --> 01:17:51,903
We're all good here!
But thanks for checking on us, captain!

697
01:17:51,987 --> 01:17:55,323
We are taking everyone
to the Mountain Peak Hotel!

698
01:17:55,407 --> 01:17:58,159
For your safety,
we request that you follow us!

699
01:17:58,243 --> 01:18:00,913
Aye, aye! Will do!

700
01:18:02,790 --> 01:18:04,416
Looks like the whole town is here.

701
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:05,583
I don't see your mom.

702
01:18:05,667 --> 01:18:08,712
- I hope she's OK.
- Ponyo, time for us to cast off.

703
01:18:08,796 --> 01:18:09,838
Hold on a second.

704
01:18:16,512 --> 01:18:20,640
- Here, have some milk.
- Oh. Uh...

705
01:18:20,724 --> 01:18:21,766
It's for milk.

706
01:18:21,850 --> 01:18:24,602
She already ate all the ham
off those sandwiches.

707
01:18:24,686 --> 01:18:27,605
Thank you.
That's very generous of you, Ponyo.

708
01:18:27,689 --> 01:18:29,441
Sosuke, here.

709
01:18:29,525 --> 01:18:31,609
I brought you the biggest candle I have.

710
01:18:31,693 --> 01:18:34,696
Thanks. Ponyo will make it bigger.

711
01:18:34,780 --> 01:18:37,407
- See you later.
- Take care.

712
01:18:37,491 --> 01:18:39,576
Be careful.

713
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:46,750
Oh! What's the matter?

714
01:18:50,963 --> 01:18:54,633
Shh, shh, shh. You have a cold.

715
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:13,569
Ponyo!

716
01:19:26,373 --> 01:19:28,208
Hey, are you guys OK?

717
01:19:28,292 --> 01:19:29,751
Hey, Sosuke.

718
01:19:29,835 --> 01:19:32,754
- What are you doing out here?
- Sosuke, where's your mother?

719
01:19:32,838 --> 01:19:34,839
She went to the senior center last night!

720
01:19:34,923 --> 01:19:36,132
We're on our way to find her!

721
01:19:36,216 --> 01:19:39,469
You know, I still can't believe
Lisa beat that wave.

722
01:19:39,553 --> 01:19:42,847
- That's Lisa.
- Sosuke, can I ride with you?

723
01:19:42,931 --> 01:19:45,934
I can't. I'm busy.
I have a job to do now.

724
01:19:46,018 --> 01:19:49,604
Check the park.
The seniors should be there by now.

725
01:19:49,688 --> 01:19:52,023
- Good luck, kid!
- You'll find her!

726
01:19:52,107 --> 01:19:56,653
We'll send a boat for the seniors
as soon as we drop this group off!

727
01:19:56,737 --> 01:20:00,616
Good luck, captain!

728
01:20:47,538 --> 01:20:51,166
Ponyo, our candle is just about out.

729
01:20:54,127 --> 01:20:58,173
We'll be OK.
The fisherman gave me another one.

730
01:20:58,257 --> 01:21:01,593
Ow! It's still pretty hot.

731
01:21:06,181 --> 01:21:09,100
Bye-bye.

732
01:21:09,184 --> 01:21:12,354
Here, Ponyo. Can you make this bigger?

733
01:21:13,397 --> 01:21:15,315
All right.

734
01:21:20,445 --> 01:21:23,323
Hey, are you OK?

735
01:21:23,407 --> 01:21:25,200
Hm?

736
01:21:30,205 --> 01:21:32,958
- Ponyo.
- Hm?

737
01:21:47,723 --> 01:21:49,349
Ponyo. Ponyo!

738
01:22:46,782 --> 01:22:49,618
Oh, good. I can walk from here.

739
01:23:16,269 --> 01:23:17,729
There's the road.

740
01:23:28,990 --> 01:23:32,160
It's shrinking!

741
01:23:33,161 --> 01:23:34,496
Ponyo!

742
01:23:54,141 --> 01:23:55,517
Ponyo!

743
01:23:56,518 --> 01:23:58,645
Ponyo, wake up!

744
01:24:00,897 --> 01:24:03,525
Sosuke.

745
01:24:08,989 --> 01:24:10,573
You scared me.

746
01:24:10,657 --> 01:24:13,702
Don't turn into a fish again.
I'd miss you.

747
01:24:25,922 --> 01:24:29,551
My mom's car! Ponyo, come on!
She might be there!

748
01:24:33,388 --> 01:24:35,974
Hey, Mom! Mom!

749
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:39,561
Mommy!

750
01:24:43,732 --> 01:24:45,984
Mommy!

751
01:24:47,694 --> 01:24:49,821
Mom!

752
01:24:53,742 --> 01:24:55,243
Mommy!

753
01:24:57,746 --> 01:24:59,790
Mom!

754
01:25:02,375 --> 01:25:04,085
Mom!

755
01:25:32,489 --> 01:25:35,199
Here, I've got your boat.

756
01:25:35,283 --> 01:25:37,994
There's water coming from your eyes.

757
01:25:44,626 --> 01:25:47,921
- Let's go find your mom.
- Mm-hm.

758
01:26:33,967 --> 01:26:36,886
- It's so beautiful!
- You forgot your cane!

759
01:26:36,970 --> 01:26:39,430
Look, here comes a whale again!

760
01:26:39,514 --> 01:26:41,098
I think he sees us.

761
01:26:41,182 --> 01:26:43,142
The other side is nice, isn't it?

762
01:26:43,226 --> 01:26:46,187
- And my knees don't hurt.
- This is the other side?

763
01:26:46,271 --> 01:26:49,649
Where do you think we are, Las Vegas?

764
01:26:49,733 --> 01:26:54,904
- It's like a dream.
- Ladies, can we gather around, please?

765
01:26:54,988 --> 01:26:58,449
- Coming!
- Why don't we run?

766
01:26:58,533 --> 01:27:00,284
Come on!

767
01:27:00,368 --> 01:27:04,247
- It's so nice to run.
- Beat you there!

768
01:27:08,710 --> 01:27:10,837
Winner!

769
01:27:14,716 --> 01:27:16,634
Everyone, quiet, please.

770
01:27:16,718 --> 01:27:19,762
The time has come for you to bear witness

771
01:27:19,846 --> 01:27:22,640
to a sacred test of love.

772
01:27:22,724 --> 01:27:26,185
- Oh, how exciting!
- Are they too young for this?

773
01:27:26,269 --> 01:27:28,396
- Are we too old?
- When are they coming?

774
01:27:29,731 --> 01:27:32,358
Please, ladies,
the children are coming now.

775
01:27:32,442 --> 01:27:35,361
And remember,
this is a very important moment.

776
01:27:35,445 --> 01:27:37,738
A crucial moment.

777
01:27:37,822 --> 01:27:42,159
Fujimoto, you won't let any harm
come to Sosuke or Ponyo, will you?

778
01:27:42,243 --> 01:27:45,037
It's not in his nature.

779
01:27:45,121 --> 01:27:47,790
Of course I wouldn't.

780
01:27:47,874 --> 01:27:51,252
My hope is Ponyo will stay asleep.
Excuse me.

781
01:28:00,053 --> 01:28:02,388
Do you think we can trust him?

782
01:28:02,472 --> 01:28:04,891
I wonder what Lisa is thinking.

783
01:28:04,975 --> 01:28:06,350
She's with that woman,

784
01:28:06,434 --> 01:28:09,813
and they've been talking
all night and day.

785
01:28:17,821 --> 01:28:20,406
Poor Lisa. Must be hard on her.

786
01:28:20,490 --> 01:28:23,367
I wish we could hear
what they're talking about.

787
01:28:23,451 --> 01:28:25,912
Oh, why don't we just ask. Lisa!

788
01:28:25,996 --> 01:28:29,332
Lisa!

789
01:28:34,754 --> 01:28:36,047
Lisa!

790
01:28:36,131 --> 01:28:38,841
We wanna know what you're talking about!

791
01:28:38,925 --> 01:28:40,218
Come tell us!

792
01:28:54,816 --> 01:28:56,525
- My dear!
- Lisa!

793
01:28:56,609 --> 01:28:57,693
What's going on?

794
01:28:57,777 --> 01:29:00,154
Lisa, are you sure
you can trust that man?

795
01:29:00,238 --> 01:29:01,405
It's so exciting.

796
01:29:01,489 --> 01:29:03,491
Tell us what's going to happen next.

797
01:29:03,575 --> 01:29:06,285
Whatever happens,
I'm just glad you're all here for this.

798
01:29:06,369 --> 01:29:09,121
It's going to be fine.

799
01:29:09,205 --> 01:29:10,305
It's going to be fine.

800
01:29:33,521 --> 01:29:35,773
I think I've been here before.

801
01:29:35,857 --> 01:29:38,401
Ponyo?

802
01:29:38,485 --> 01:29:40,653
Don't like this place.

803
01:29:44,532 --> 01:29:46,909
Don't let go of my hand.

804
01:29:46,993 --> 01:29:48,620
Mm...

805
01:30:24,531 --> 01:30:26,491
Ponyo!

806
01:30:45,009 --> 01:30:46,010
Ponyo!

807
01:30:54,185 --> 01:30:55,270
Ponyo!

808
01:31:17,125 --> 01:31:19,543
Ponyo! Please don't die!

809
01:31:19,627 --> 01:31:22,213
Ponyo!

810
01:31:22,297 --> 01:31:26,050
- Ponyo, wake up!
- Shh.

811
01:31:26,134 --> 01:31:28,219
Be careful not to wake her.

812
01:31:28,303 --> 01:31:32,431
It's good to meet you, Sosuke.
We've all been waiting for you.

813
01:31:32,515 --> 01:31:36,227
- The old ladies, your mother...
- My mother?

814
01:31:36,311 --> 01:31:39,855
Won't you come with me
and join them, Sosuke? Ponyo, too.

815
01:31:39,939 --> 01:31:41,899
Come with me.

816
01:31:41,983 --> 01:31:45,111
I promise I'm not
going to take Ponyo away from you.

817
01:31:45,195 --> 01:31:47,905
- We have to go now.
- Sosuke!

818
01:31:47,989 --> 01:31:50,908
Sosuke, don't listen to that wacko!

819
01:31:50,992 --> 01:31:53,577
He tricked all the others
into going with him,

820
01:31:53,661 --> 01:31:55,788
- but he couldn't fool me!
- Toki!

821
01:31:55,872 --> 01:31:57,790
Did you hear me? Nobody fools me!

822
01:31:57,874 --> 01:32:02,086
There is so little time!
My choice has to be made!

823
01:32:02,170 --> 01:32:05,256
If the moon comes any closer...
Can't you see it?

824
01:32:05,340 --> 01:32:07,800
The world is out of balance!
We will all be underwater!

825
01:32:07,884 --> 01:32:11,178
That's the best excuse you can
come up with? A falling moon?

826
01:32:11,262 --> 01:32:14,098
- Humans!
- Sosuke, come to me!

827
01:32:14,182 --> 01:32:16,225
Sosuke, please listen.
You have to trust me.

828
01:32:16,309 --> 01:32:19,854
You're the only one who can
save the planet. Do it now. Do it!

829
01:32:20,813 --> 01:32:22,690
Ponyo!

830
01:32:24,359 --> 01:32:26,694
Brunhilde, respect your father!

831
01:32:33,076 --> 01:32:34,743
Ponyo!

832
01:32:34,827 --> 01:32:37,580
Sosuke, come on!

833
01:32:37,664 --> 01:32:39,666
Bring them to me!

834
01:32:44,837 --> 01:32:46,631
Faster!

835
01:32:48,675 --> 01:32:50,093
Jump for it!

836
01:33:29,757 --> 01:33:30,758
Now what?

837
01:34:25,730 --> 01:34:28,065
- Mama!
- Sosuke.

838
01:34:28,149 --> 01:34:29,859
Ponyo!

839
01:34:34,322 --> 01:34:36,907
You don't have to swim.

840
01:34:36,991 --> 01:34:39,035
I don't know why we're here.

841
01:34:48,169 --> 01:34:51,964
- So this is Sosuke.
- How do you do?

842
01:34:52,048 --> 01:34:55,092
- Are you Ponyo's mother?
- Yes.

843
01:34:55,176 --> 01:34:57,761
You brought my daughter safely here.

844
01:34:57,845 --> 01:35:00,097
- Shh!
- Thank you.

845
01:35:00,181 --> 01:35:03,726
Sosuke, Ponyo opened a magic well

846
01:35:03,810 --> 01:35:09,023
because she wants very much
to be human, to become a real girl.

847
01:35:09,107 --> 01:35:14,236
She needs you to accept
and love her as she truly is.

848
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:18,782
You know that Ponyo was a fish,
don't you?

849
01:35:18,866 --> 01:35:20,117
Mm-hm.

850
01:35:20,201 --> 01:35:22,161
And you know her as a human.

851
01:35:22,245 --> 01:35:25,414
- Your drop of blood did that.
- Oh, that's it!

852
01:35:25,498 --> 01:35:28,751
I cut my thumb.
Then Ponyo licked it and made it better.

853
01:35:28,835 --> 01:35:31,337
So that's how she changed into a human.

854
01:35:31,421 --> 01:35:36,133
Could you love her
if she moved between two worlds?

855
01:35:36,217 --> 01:35:38,802
Mm-hm. I love all the Ponyos.

856
01:35:38,886 --> 01:35:43,516
It's a big responsibility,
but I really love her.

857
01:35:52,942 --> 01:35:55,820
Ooh!

858
01:35:57,238 --> 01:35:59,532
Ponyo, come here, please.

859
01:36:13,754 --> 01:36:18,593
Ponyo, Sosuke has promised
to accept you as you are.

860
01:36:21,137 --> 01:36:25,057
To become human,
you must choose to abandon magic.

861
01:36:25,141 --> 01:36:28,603
- Can you do that?
- Mm-hm.

862
01:36:37,612 --> 01:36:40,781
Kiss the bubble, child,
when you return to land,

863
01:36:40,865 --> 01:36:45,119
and Ponyo will become a girl,
growing up just like you.

864
01:36:48,623 --> 01:36:51,041
I accept, Ponyo.

865
01:36:51,125 --> 01:36:54,420
Thank you very much, Ponyo's mother.

866
01:36:59,967 --> 01:37:02,970
Everyone,
the balance of nature is restored.

867
01:37:03,054 --> 01:37:06,140
Life begins again.

868
01:37:06,933 --> 01:37:08,893
I'm so proud!

869
01:37:14,524 --> 01:37:16,567
My Sosuke.

870
01:37:41,008 --> 01:37:43,802
- Good luck, Lisa.
- Thank you.

871
01:37:43,886 --> 01:37:45,680
I'll take care of her.

872
01:37:56,899 --> 01:37:59,986
There you are! Are you all right?

873
01:38:05,324 --> 01:38:07,451
Wait, let me get your wheelchairs!

874
01:38:07,535 --> 01:38:09,661
Don't bother, Shima-san.
We like to walk.

875
01:38:09,745 --> 01:38:11,914
Life begins again.

876
01:38:15,167 --> 01:38:17,169
This is yours, I believe.

877
01:38:19,630 --> 01:38:23,133
- Thank you.
- Try to remember me kindly.

878
01:38:23,217 --> 01:38:25,219
If you will. May I?

879
01:38:30,891 --> 01:38:32,893
Take care of Ponyo.

880
01:38:34,061 --> 01:38:36,522
It's your father!

881
01:38:40,985 --> 01:38:44,905
Koichi! Hi!

882
01:38:44,989 --> 01:38:46,657
Over here!

883
01:38:46,741 --> 01:38:50,410
Ah! Lisa and Sosuke!

884
01:38:50,494 --> 01:38:52,204
Ahoy!

885
01:38:52,288 --> 01:38:55,499
Look, Ponyo, there's my dad's ship!
