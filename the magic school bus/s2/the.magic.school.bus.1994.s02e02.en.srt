1
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,000
Heads up guys! Here it comes!.

2
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,393
Aaah! Very good, class...but let's see a little more
spirit!

3
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,677
Move those bodies! Get your BACK into it,
Arnold!

4
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,594
Good - Now, bend your KNEES, Wanda. That's
it!

5
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,592
I got it! I got it!

6
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,116
More WRlST, Carlos! It's all in the WRlST!

7
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,916
Poor, Ralphie. He doesn't look very happy
cleaning the bus all by himself.

8
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,713
It's his turn, Phoebe. Besides, we're ALWAYS
doing things for Ralphie -

9
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,268
Iike how many times have I clapped the erasers
for him?.

10
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,952
Or cleaned the hamster cage?.

11
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,916
You know!

12
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,231
Just yesterday he asked me to change the water
in the goldfish bowl for him

13
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,197
¡®cause he was late for soccer practice.

14
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,439
I tell"ya, Liz, all this ELBOW grease is wearin' me
out.

15
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,238
... I gotta take a break.

16
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,352
If only I had a robot that could do my work for me.

17
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,598
Think about it, Liz, we'd never have to clean the
bus again.

18
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,114
Hey, a guy can dream, can't he?.

19
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,476
The truth is: What is the highway of life all about

20
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,596
If  not to enjoy the detours?.

21
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,832
Like practicing my hook shot...

22
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,191
OR PERFECTlNG MY CURVEBALL...

23
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,156
Or working on my slapshot.

24
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,393
That's it, Liz!!! I could make a robot!

25
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,353
HEY, GUYS! I HAVE A BRlLLlANT lDEA!

26
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,193
What would you say if I built a ROBOT to do all
our chores?.

27
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,190
A robot!

28
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,076
Cool!

29
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,195
Oh no.

30
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,272
I'd say that was the silliest idea you've ever had!

31
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,636
Silly is as silly does or doesn't.

32
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,076
Oh, excuse me, Ralphie. I need to get out of the
sun.

33
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,870
You can't be serious, Ralphie. You can't build a
robot!

34
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,837
Oh yeah?.! Wanna bet?.!

35
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,918
Sure! But if you can't come up with a robot -

36
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,918
no baseball, no basketball and no soccer...

37
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,039
AND, you have to do ALL the chores! Still wanna
bet?.

38
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,237
Well, I can do it if everybody helps.

39
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,799
I mean, once the robot's built

40
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,552
NONE of us have to do chores again!

41
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,636
Maybe we CAN do it.

42
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,756
We won't know unless we try.

43
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,832
Way to go, Wanda. Keesha... You got a bet!

44
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,112
Hold on there Bus!

45
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,671
What happened to the bus???.!

46
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,957
Hmmm... Looks like the mesmerglobber blew a
gasket!

47
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,676
Onto the bus, class! This is an emergency!

48
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,435
Ms Frizzle, wait!

49
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,956
Sorry, we have a busy, busy day ahead! No time
for waiting!

50
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,919
Only time for taking chances - making mistakes -
getting messy!

51
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,478
Hop in, Ralphie!

52
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,275
Wonder if this could be another...nah,

53
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,190
it couldn't be.

54
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,469
It lS a field trip.

55
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,949
Excuse me, Ms. Frizzle!!! But there's something
important I have to do.

56
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,196
Well, you're on the right bus, Ralphie -

57
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,159
because where we're going - there's something
for EVERYONE to do!

58
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,754
We're here!

59
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,516
Presenting, "The One-of-a-kind,

60
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,639
Satisfaction-Guaranteed, Service-with-a-scowl
Body Shop'!!!

61
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,792
YlKES!!!

62
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,751
Whoa, look at all that stuff! Just what I need to
make a robot!

63
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,558
How do we get across, Ms Frizzle?.

64
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,278
Across???.!

65
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,993
It's gonna get us!

66
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,990
Aha! It GOT us!!!

67
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,798
Wow!! This is incredible!

68
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,199
COOL!!

69
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,232
LOOK OUT BELOW!

70
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,553
Long time no see, Valerie.

71
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,517
They must know each other!

72
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,717
Class, meet Radius Ulna Humerus:.

73
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,394
magical mechanic at large.

74
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,358
Humerus, as in upper arm bone?.

75
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,876
Or R. U. Humerus, as in in really funny?.

76
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,999
I love it!

77
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,308
CAR-LOS!

78
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,156
R.U. is the genius who taught me everything l
know about busonautics.

79
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,832
You musta forgotten it all...

80
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,480
...or else this bus has acquired a split personality.

81
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,358
Or else it's the mesmerglobber behind the
shrinkerscope -

82
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,396
which I believe is still under warranty.

83
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,751
I'll check it, Val,

84
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,400
but you caught me at a bad time. I'm expecting
another customer.

85
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,596
More important than moi?.

86
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,991
No one's more important than you, my little toggle
bolt.

87
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,439
My little toggle bolt?????.

88
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,948
Let's get crackin'!!

89
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,235
Now that the coast is clear, let's start building
that robot!

90
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,115
I still say it'll never work.

91
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,191
We don't even know where to start.

92
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,432
It's simple! All we have to do is build a robot that
looks like me.

93
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,714
Like this?.

94
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,589
I'm serious! How hard can it be?.

95
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,952
Just attach a doohickey like this to something like
this!

96
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,871
Hmmm, be right back.

97
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,790
Watch your fIank, my little sprocket!

98
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,518
Careful, my feisty fIywheel.

99
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,919
IG-Nl-TlONNNN...!

100
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,348
Hmm, the Bus has never done that before.

101
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,795
It's definitely not the mesmerglobber!

102
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,916
Oh well, maybe it's the plangdabber.

103
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,433
Excuse me, Ms Frizzle.

104
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,990
Let's say you wanted to uh...to build something.

105
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,832
You mean, build character?.

106
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:03,869
Build a new and better tomorrow?. Or build a
robot that would do all your chores.

107
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,798
Um...probably closest to that last one...

108
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,598
You CAN'T build a robot...

109
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,433
...UNLESS you know how your own body works.

110
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,476
You know how it works?. Huh?.

111
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,154
Well...not exactly.

112
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,993
Your body needs support to hold it up!

113
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,275
It's got to have structure!

114
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,713
And to find out about that...

115
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,794
...you need my special Megariffic lntrascopic
KlNETO-EXAMlNOMETOSCOPE!

116
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,633
"MlKE' for short!

117
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,392
Which l, of course, keep hidden away

118
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,392
where no nosey kid can find it!!

119
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,119
Pretty clever, my shining shock absorber.

120
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,673
I think so!

121
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,910
Hear that, Ralphie?. Structure's the thing.

122
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,228
Gotcha, Ms Frizzle!

123
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,436
Okay, so to find out how my body works I need to
know about structure

124
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,357
- but what's MlKE got to do with it?.!

125
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,950
Wonder what THlS button does?.

126
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,309
Wow! Check out all those bones!

127
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,109
I've got it! My bones must be the STRUCTURE
Ms Frizzle was talking about!

128
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:10,395
Cool! I mean... it's chilly in here.

129
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,437
Looks to me like your bones support all the other
parts of your body.

130
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:19,513
And some of them are like neat little cages
protecting your squishy parts

131
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,831
Iike your heart and your lungs!...See?.

132
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,957
That's it! My robot needs structure!

133
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,112
All we need to do is find some stiff parts like
bones and

134
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,792
Ralphiebot is born!

135
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,155
Don't forget our bet, Ralphie.

136
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,791
Forget it?. I'm about to win it! Step back,
everyone!

137
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,759
I command you, Ralphiebot - MAKE ME A
SANDWlCH!

138
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,312
Let's see, there's bus detail, eraser patrol, chair
management...

139
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,391
QUlET! I need to concentrate!

140
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,600
...Listen to me, Ralphiebot... MAKE ME A
SANDWlCH! NOW...!!!

141
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,554
Can you make me a sandwhich, please?.

142
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:41,235
Please?. How about half a sandwich?.

143
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,914
He doesn't move or bend.

144
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,195
He doesn't do anything!

145
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,757
Just like Ralphie...

146
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,319
Hey, where's Arnold?.

147
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,111
Over here, you guys!

148
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,078
Wow! Look at that!

149
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,311
Arnold's tying his shoe. What's the big deal?.

150
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,473
Check it out!...Arnold's elbow lets his arm bend in
the middle?.

151
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,438
That's the difference between us and Ralphiebot!

152
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,271
I see now! It's not the bones themselves that let
someone move...

153
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,430
... it's the way they're joined together.

154
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,356
Of course! It's the JOlNTS that let the BONES
move! Don't go away...

155
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:23,230
Hurry back, Ralphie. Radius' other customer will
be here any minute.

156
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,038
Can I come out now?.

157
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,917
Find the problem yet, R. U.?.

158
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,312
One thing's for sure, your levitation linkage is
leaking!

159
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,638
Sorry, my little--

160
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:45,431
S'cuse me, Ms Frizzle... but let's say you need to
make some connections,

161
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,834
but you don't know how?.

162
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,639
You mean connections as in meeting the right
people?.

163
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,915
Connections as in a cable-TV hookup?.

164
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,879
Or connections as in joints to let your bones
move?.

165
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,394
Um, probably closer to the last one.

166
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,150
Everything HlNGES on making the right
connections, my boy.

167
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:07,351
Time to BUCKLE down before my next
appointment gets here!...Catch my BENT?.

168
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,159
This door hinge is perfect!

169
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,549
It goes back and forth - but not sideways,

170
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,755
just like Ralphie's elbow joint!

171
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,829
This shower head has a joint that can move in
ALL directions!

172
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,751
Just like Ralphie's shoulder!

173
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,239
And this thing's got a whole SERlES of joints.

174
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,232
Perfect for a backbone that BENDS and TWlSTS.

175
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,790
Now Ralphiebot can move and do all the things l
do!

176
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,998
At my old school, we weren't allowed to make a
robot that could move!

177
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,389
Well, Keesh?.

178
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,109
Ready to admit that this is the greatest idea in
the history of kidkind?.

179
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,555
We'll see, Ralphie...we'll see.

180
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,750
Ralphie, it's amazing!

181
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,991
Yep. Kinda reminds me of me.

182
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,794
I command you, Ralphiebot,

183
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:04,396
bow to your Ruler and Master:. Ralphie the
Magnificent!

184
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,953
It's not bowing.

185
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,917
Do you blame it?. I wouldn't either.

186
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,351
C'mon you guys!

187
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:18,231
I don't get it! It's got BONES for STRUCTURE!

188
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,231
It's got JOlNTS for FLEXlBlLlTY!

189
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,197
Why won't it MOVE???.!

190
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,480
Aha! You lose, Ralphie!

191
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,030
No way! If I can move - it can move!

192
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:39,590
C'mon, guys! We gotta find out how to make that
robot move!!

193
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,274
This red and blue button must do something!

194
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,517
What'dya see, what'dya see???.!

195
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,990
I see your muscles pulling your bones up and
down and back and forth.

196
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,989
Hey! Do that again... That's it! The missing link!

197
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,117
It's your MUSCLES that pull your bones to make
them move!

198
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:01,239
Exactly! The reason the robot didn't move a
muscle was...

199
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,992
Because he didn't have any!

200
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,076
Well...didn't everybody know that?.

201
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,673
But where are we going to find some muscles?.
LlZ...!!!

202
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,954
I've got it!

203
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:27,073
Look at this! These things work just like
muscles! One pulls this way...

204
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,077
And one pulls the other way.

205
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,118
That makes sense, because according to my
research -

206
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,476
muscles can only pull on things - not push them.

207
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,518
"Seems to me, if we all pull together,

208
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,591
we can make Ralphiebot move!

209
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,598
Let's do it!

210
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,558
He's even more than I'd imagined he'd be!

211
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,910
I think it's really going to work!

212
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,036
An amazing combination:

213
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,151
bones for structure, joints for fIexibility -

214
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,715
and muscles for MOVEMENT!

215
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,315
Well, he's certainly an improvement on the
original - that's for sure.

216
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,119
Personally, Keesha, I think you"re jealous cause

217
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,317
I'm gonna win the bet. But that's okay...

218
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,914
... because none of us'll ever have to do chores
again

219
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,072
when I say 'Ralphiebot, clean the bus!'

220
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,755
Um, guys... I think he moved!

221
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:25,753
(CHEER...)

222
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,432
Hey! Where's he going?.!

223
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,271
Ralphie, do something! Stop him!

224
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,754
I COMMAND YOU!...STOP!!! STOP!!!

225
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,591
I knew I should've--

226
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,908
Don't say it, Arnold!

227
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,950
MS FRlZZLE...LOOK OUT!!!

228
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,473
Oh my! A Ralphiebot!

229
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,157
Ms Frizzle, get out of the way!

230
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,159
Ms Frizzle!...Are you okay?.!

231
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,595
I'm better than okay, Ralphie!

232
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:51,036
I'm blown away by your ingenuity! Yeee-haw!!!

233
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,995
Sorry, Ms Frizzle. I... I didn't tell him to do it!

234
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,513
Yes, you did, Ralphie.

235
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,149
He heard you say you wanted him to CLEAN
THE BUS!

236
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,874
HELP!

237
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,837
Me and my big mouth!

238
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,111
Ralphie do some thing...!

239
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,118
LlKE WHAT?.!

240
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,556
Take charge, my boy!

241
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,872
Show "im who's boss!

242
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,757
You're right, Mr. Humerus.

243
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,796
Ah, call me R. U. WHEE-HAW!

244
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,317
This is your Master speaking! COOL lT!

245
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,152
That's better. HEY! I said COOL lT!

246
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:00,638
NO! I didn't mean SOAK the BUS... I meant
STOP!

247
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,392
I don't think he's going to stop until he's finished.

248
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,754
Or we're finished!

249
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,871
Do something, Ralphie!

250
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,036
WHAT?????.!

251
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,599
Get a grip, Ralphie!

252
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,472
I've GOT a grip!

253
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,594
Think! If your body needs joints and muscles to
move...

254
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:26,595
Then...uh...RlGHT! WlTHOUT muscles - it
couldn't move at all!

255
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,831
Ah, excellent observation, Ralphie.

256
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,115
But how do I get rid of the muscles?.

257
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,390
I'll help you, Ralphie!

258
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,719
Yo, Keesh! Thanks!

259
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,758
COME BACK HERE!

260
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,113
C'mon Keesha,

261
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,156
we've got to immobilize those muscles,

262
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,152
un-hinge those hinges and de-bone that robot

263
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,993
before it wipes out our entire class!

264
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,673
KEESHA, GET ME THAT SCREWDRlVER!

265
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,551
Bet's off, Ralphie. Do what you have to do!

266
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,510
You're okay, Keesha!

267
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,357
No joints... no movement!

268
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,913
No muscles... no movement!

269
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:40,113
I really wish I didn't have to do this but it's the
only way.

270
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,711
Kinda hate to see the robot go like that. The kid
did a good job.

271
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,752
Ah, that's my Ralphie.

272
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,549
No movement... No nothing!

273
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,916
You OK Ralphie?.

274
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,110
Looks like you stopped him alright!

275
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,990
I take back what I said, Ralphie -

276
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,355
the robot wasn't such an improvement after all.

277
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,873
Tell me about it.

278
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,315
I took a chance - I got messy...

279
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,119
...and what do I have to show for it?.

280
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,428
Don't feel bad, Ralphie. You didn't do anything
wrong.

281
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,317
Yeah, you were on the right track.

282
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,836
And we DlD find out that bones and joints and
muscles

283
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,196
are just as important for a robot as they are for
us.

284
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,630
Maybe next time it'll work.

285
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,391
Hope so. Good help is always hard to find.

286
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,395
Why Liz...thanks. I'm touched.

287
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,919
So I guess it all goes to prove something, doesn't
it, Ralphie?.

288
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,789
Yep... When you've got all the moves like I do -

289
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,632
it's pretty hard to make improvements!

290
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,112
Unless you're a magic school bus,

291
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:01,837
that is.

292
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,116
There was nothing wrong with the shrinkerscope,

293
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,760
my little wingnut - and you knew it!

294
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,475
Looks like your other customer never showed up,
R. U.

295
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,397
Oh yes, they did...

296
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,957
As I always say,

297
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,033
Is it the magic school bus?.

298
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,189
Is it the magic school bus?.

299
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,156
The magic school bus?.

300
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,229
Is it the magic school bus?.

301
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,514
Is it the magic school bus?.

302
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,555
The magic school bus?.

303
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,949
The magic school bus?.

304
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,190
Well I'll tellya this, Liz - it's the first time Valerie...

305
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,829
Ms Frizzle, has paid my mechanic's fee in robots!

306
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,394
Get that, will"ya?.

307
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,669
Body Shop - where the best come to get better!

308
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,548
Hi! The Producer over at the Magic School Bus
told me to talk to you.

309
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,154
I just watched the show on Body Mechanics and l
think

310
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,835
you know a lot more about fixing things than you
do about human bodies.

311
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,480
Is that so?.! For instance.

312
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,393
Well, for instance, there are a lot more bones and
muscles

313
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,357
in the human body than you actually showed.

314
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,475
Of course there are.

315
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:46,155
And did YOU know there are 27 bones in the
hand alone?.

316
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,437
...And it takes 14 muscles to make a funny face!

317
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,035
That's pretty amazing. But what about ligaments
and tendons?.

318
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,838
You didn't even talk about them!

319
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:58,151
You're right, kid, but we can't show everything in
a half hour.

320
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,277
Ligaments are bands that hold the bones at your
joints together -

321
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,715
So they don't move too far in the wrong direction.

322
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,550
And tendons hook your muscles to your bones so
you can hop and jump around.

323
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,798
People aren't the only things that work that way,
you know.

324
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,555
Of course not! Cats, dogs, horses, snakes,
fish...

325
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,519
...even lizards need bones and joints and
muscles to move.

326
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:26,276
But some animals, like insects, don't have bones
at all.

327
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,874
Instead, they have a stiff covering on the outside

328
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,077
which works with the muscles on the inside to let
them move.

329
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:36,517
Come on, it takes more than bones, joints and
muscles to build a real robot!

330
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,398
I mean, it would need a battery or an engine for
energy -

331
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,630
and some sort of brain to control it.

332
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,518
Are you saying that the Ralphiebot is
BRAlNLESS???.!

333
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,750
Well, yeah, I guess so.

334
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:51,036
Well, all I can tell you is this - for not having a
brain,

335
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,917
he makes a pretty good sundae!

336
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,518
Thanks for checking in.
