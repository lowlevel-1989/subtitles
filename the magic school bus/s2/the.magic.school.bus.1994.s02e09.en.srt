1
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,430
"Wings are the difference between flying and
not".

2
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,910
"lf you have them you can, if you don't, you
cannot".

3
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,436
With wings you can soar and glide in the breeze,

4
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:22,117
And dip and turn with incredible ease. "Do
loop-de-loops and shoot thru hoops".

5
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,638
"Fly upside-down. And roll around". "And never
ever leave the sky".

6
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,835
It's goanna crash!

7
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,716
NOSE UP, TlM! NOSE UP! Don't let her rash!
She's my baby!

8
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,430
Chill out, Wanda, I know how to fly this thing. I
designed it, didn't l?.

9
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,637
Based on MY dream - MY idea!

10
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,358
I drew up the plans!

11
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,795
And I helped you build it!

12
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,152
Any questions?.

13
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,357
Your baby's fine, Wanda. Not a scratch.

14
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:11,710
Someday you'll read about me. Wildcat Wanda,
ace test pilot, queen of the clouds!

15
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,439
Too bad the Frizz wasn't here to see the test
flight.

16
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,316
Afternoon, class.

17
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,675
Good afternoon, Ms Frizzle.

18
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,469
I was just checking the wind conditions for
today's model airplane show.

19
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,712
Nothing like a little moving air to lift the spirits, l
always say!

20
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,954
AND lift the plane. We might even win first prize
with my new wing design.

21
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,679
Wings are wings. What's the big deal?

22
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,318
Try flying without'em, Arnold.

23
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,916
No, thanks. I prefer walking. At least there's
something holding me up.

24
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,470
Ground, Arnold! Dull, dirty, boring ground -

25
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,950
that's what's holding you up! But it's also keeping
you down!

26
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,429
Imagine being inside this plane

27
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,717
streaking through the air at hundreds of miles an
hour -

28
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,076
with nothing but sky above and clouds below!

29
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,310
Streaking thru THlN air, you mean!

30
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,678
Come on, Arnold, it would be pretty hard to
streak thru FAT air!

31
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,472
CAR-LOS!

32
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:21,789
Let's see, wings and thin air. Now there's a
combo that just might fly!

33
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:27,875
Oh, no! You're not thinking about a field trip in
Wanda's plane,

34
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,109
are you, Ms Frizzle?.

35
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,670
Of course not, Arnold. I'm THROUGH thinking
about it!

36
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,715
It's time to take chances - make mistakes -

37
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:43,239
and fly like the wind! Ah... Thank you, Liz.

38
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,669
We can't ALL go,

39
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,070
Ms Frizzle. Somebody has to stay here and
operate the remote controls.

40
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,119
Affirmative, Tim! That puts you in charge of the
ground crew.

41
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,668
I need two volunteers to stay with Tim.

42
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,751
I'll stay, Ms Frizzle! I'll stay!

43
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:01,311
Oh, Phoebe... why don't you and Liz remain here.

44
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,356
I was afraid you'd say that.

45
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,873
All set for proper shrinkage. Hit it, Phoebe!

46
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:14,031
Well, uh... here goes! Say 'fly'.

47
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,838
FLYYYYYYYYYY!!!

48
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,436
Amazing!

49
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,191
I love it!

50
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,272
Too bad EVERY kid can't have a portashrinker!

51
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,954
Going up! Single file, please.

52
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,190
You're the best, Ms Frizzle!

53
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:38,834
The wild blue yonder is yours, Wanda. Go for it!
Yahoo.

54
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,434
Hey, Tim did a great job!

55
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,635
Yeah, he did.

56
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,032
This is fantastic! There's even room for my books.

57
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,076
I think Tim forgot the parachutes.

58
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:58,317
No need for parachutes. Not with Wildcat Wanda
at the controls.

59
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,279
Come on, Wanda, they're not real -they're only
paint and wood!

60
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,512
Wood or not - we're going where no kid has gone
before!

61
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,953
Can we talk about this?.

62
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,235
Of course, Arnold. But right now

63
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,075
it's time to buckle up and fly right!

64
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,959
You ready?.

65
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,996
All systems go!

66
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,039
Roger!

67
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,877
Prepare for an UPLlFTlNG experience, class.

68
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,235
And hold onto your hats!

69
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,951
Don't you ever listen?.

70
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,995
Happy landing!!!

71
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,876
We're up!

72
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,598
We're flying!

73
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,515
Feel that air moving past us!

74
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,115
They don't call it an airplane for nothing, Keesha!

75
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,914
Looking good, Tim! Can I try it?.

76
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,877
Sure, but be careful.

77
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,554
This joy stick moves the tail rudder back and forth
-

78
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:11,191
That's what steers the plane wherever you want it
to go.

79
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,636
Got it! Wonder how high it will go?.

80
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,590
We're slowing down!

81
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,911
Oh, my, what an AlR raising development.

82
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,912
The air's not moving as fast as it was before!

83
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,672
According to my research,

84
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:33,276
when a plane's nose tips up and slows down like
this, it's called a stall.

85
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,557
Stall?. As in 'stop flying'???.!

86
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:41,111
Hold it! If we stop FLYlNG. That means we
start...

87
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,598
FALLLLLLLLlNG...!!!

88
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,274
It's stalling, Feeb! Nose down...QUlCK!

89
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,353
Great save Phoebe, you did it!

90
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,271
What made it fall like that?.

91
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,115
No air moving past the wings. No moving air - no
lift rock fall!

92
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,395
You pulled it out just in time.

93
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,552
The queen of the clouds is back!

94
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,029
I think l'm goanna be sick!

95
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,398
You better bring them down, Tim. It's almost time
to leave for the Air Show.

96
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,951
Will do, Feeb. Let's see. Where's a good place to
land.

97
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:33,077
Is it just me...or did Tim just smash the remote
control?.!

98
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,390
You mean we're flying WlTHOUT Tim!

99
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,119
We weren't doing so great WlTH him!

100
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,112
Do something, Wanda! You got us into this!

101
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,873
HELLLPPPP!!!!

102
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,958
What are we going to do, Feeb???.!!

103
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,874
I don't know. This never happened at my old
school.

104
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:56,751
TlM! PHOEBE! DO SOMETHlNG!GET US
DOWN!

105
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,630
Come on, Liz, choose one!

106
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,269
We have to find our plane before something
terrible happens!

107
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,671
If Ms. Frizzle were here,

108
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,194
SHE'D know how to turn this bus into the best
search

109
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,589
and rescue airplane ever built!

110
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,835
We have wings, why aren't we flying?.

111
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,718
Because there's no air moving past the wings!

112
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,832
Hey! I think we just passed my house!

113
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,595
Take a good look, Carlos. It may be the last time
you see it!

114
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,679
Come on, you weaslely whimps, where's your
spirit of adventure?.!

115
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,718
We're on the path to glory!

116
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,792
How can we be on the path to anywhere if you
can't steer?.!

117
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:59,955
Hmmm, maybe this has something to do with the
steering. Humph! Maybe not!

118
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,399
I HATE WHEN THlS HAPPENS!

119
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,473
Gotta take action! GET THOSE WlNGS DOWN!

120
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,994
Push your wing down, Carlos!

121
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,798
I'm pushing!

122
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,991
Stand by to lock, Ralphie!

123
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,390
Standing by! PUUUUUUUUSH!!!

124
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,239
Wings locked!

125
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,197
HAAAAAANG ON!!!

126
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,915
As my old flight instructor used to say, two wings
are better than none!

127
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,468
I wish your old flight instructor were here now!

128
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:40,032
Wait second! If the wings are holding up the
plane - what's holding up the wings?.

129
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,796
The same thing that's holding up Carlos
... MOVlNG AlR!

130
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:50,637
Hey! I'm FLYlNG! I can feel the air lifting me up!

131
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,073
Me, too!

132
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,515
BUBBLES AT TWELVE O'CLOCK!

133
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,714
See, Arnold! That's why we're staying up!

134
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,677
The BUBBLES are holding us up?.

135
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,833
Not the bubbles! It's the THlN AlR moving across
the wings that's pushing us up!

136
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,194
right, Ms Frizzle?.

137
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:21,877
You bet your windbreaker Keesha! We all need a
little lift now and then.

138
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,960
Remember, Liz, we need a plane that FLlES!

139
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,270
We're counting on you, Liz.

140
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,990
All right, you did it...sort of!

141
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,549
What happened?. We had TEN wings! Why didn't
we stay in the air!

142
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,232
This heap is too heavy.

143
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,753
Even if it had a HUNDRED wings

144
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,308
it wouldn't get enough LlFT for the air to hold it
up!

145
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,119
Now there aren't even any wings.

146
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,390
Anybody know where we are?.

147
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,109
We're lost - that's where we are! Lost and little!

148
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,714
They won't find us even if they find us!

149
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,436
Excuse me... but our propeller just stopped
turning!

150
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:24,752
According to my research, the propeller keeps us
moving forward.

151
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:29,516
Let me understand this. If the propeller isn't
working, we slow down, right?.

152
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,673
And if we slow down there's going to be less and
less air moving across our wings.

153
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:39,278
Exactly and when there's no air moving across
our wings we...

154
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,550
FALL!!!

155
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,919
We could WALK to where the plane is before Liz
gets us up in the air!

156
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,159
We're up!

157
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,231
But we aren't we getting any higher!

158
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:06,474
Oh oh! It doesn't look like this plane has enough
power to get us over...

159
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,758
ClTY HALLLLLL!!!

160
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,672
Topflight, Liz!

161
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,832
Nice going, Wanda!

162
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,278
We're doomed. We'll be little model kids forever!

163
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,478
Instead of being Queen of the Clouds - you
should be Queen of the Trees!

164
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,549
Oh, yeah?.

165
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:45,714
Well, Wildcat Wanda never gives up! Come on,
guys, what made us fly before?.

166
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,793
Um...air moving across the wings!

167
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,915
Roger!

168
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,991
And moving air causes lift!

169
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,672
Double Roger!

170
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,954
Come on, Wanda,

171
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,032
the only way this plane is going to move is if it
falls out of the tree!

172
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,432
Ralphie's right! There is no moving air if WE'RE
not moving!

173
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:08,435
Ah, the joys of flight! Look at the power of those
wings.

174
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:16,916
That's it, Ms Frizzle! We can use that bird to tow
us up, up and away!

175
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,594
Only one problem. How do we STAY up?.

176
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,356
Yeah, how does a bird stay up?. It doesn't have a
propeller to move it forward.

177
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,431
By flapping its wings.

178
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:31,514
Exactly!The propeller does for a plane what
flapping wings do for a bird.

179
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,475
But our propeller isn't turning!

180
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,554
AH! Look what I found!

181
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,552
Wait! I've got it!

182
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,354
Once we get up in the air we can turn the
propeller ourselves.

183
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,318
What a splendid idea!

184
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,870
They could be anywhere, Tim. We'll NEVER find
them!

185
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,997
Charles Lindbergh flew across the Atlantic Ocean
in a plane like this -

186
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,674
all by himself.And he NEVER gave up!

187
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,231
You're right, Tim. We WlLL find them! I'll drive!

188
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,755
Pedals in place, Ms Frizzle! Ready for take-off!

189
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,992
Have a seat, Arnold. Prepare for bird-assisted
takeoff!

190
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,196
As my grandmother Frieda used to say,

191
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,511
a bird on the branch is worth two on the ranch!

192
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,514
We've got moving air and lift! Pedal, guys...

193
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,589
PEDAL!

194
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:54,877
It's working! Hey pedal pushers;, you're actually
turning the propeller!

195
00:14:54,960 --> 00:15:01,308
We're climbing under our own power! Untie the
rope, Arnold!

196
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,710
Arnold!

197
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,188
Hang on, Arnold!

198
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:20,432
I'M HANG-llllllllNG...!!!

199
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:34,474
ARNOLD! ARNOLD!

200
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,190
Oh, I knew I should've stayed home today!

201
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,790
I don't want to be here either, ok?.

202
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:59,269
ARNOLD!WHAT'S THE BlRD'S TAlL DOlNG?.

203
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:05,037
Ummm... IT'S MOVlNG BACK AND FORTH lN
THE WlND! SORT OF LlKE HE'S STEERlNG!

204
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,590
HEY! MAYBE I CAN STEER BACK TO YOU!

205
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,911
SOUNDS LlKE THE PROPER COURSE TO ME!

206
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:17,672
Excuse me, but I need this more than you do.
Left turn, please!

207
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:28,639
BANK RlGHT, ARNOLD! MORE RlGHT...TOO
MUCH...BANK LEFT...

208
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:34,592
A LlTTLE MORE...HOLD lT! GOTCHA! SLlDE
DOWN!

209
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,873
Now?.

210
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,552
NOW!!!

211
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,755
GULP!

212
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,558
Way to go, Ace! Smooth move!

213
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,518
IT'S BEEN GREAT FLYlNG WlTH YOU!

214
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,357
THANKS FOR THE LlFT!!

215
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,639
I've got that air-moving-past-our-wings-feeling,
guys...keep pedalling!

216
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,755
We're out of control!

217
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:16,033
If only this wheel worked I could steer! KEEP
PEDALLlNG!

218
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,031
Too bad we're not a bird.

219
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,795
Arnold, you're a genius! You can help me steer!

220
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,949
I can?????.

221
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,031
Just like you steered that bird!

222
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,510
Exactly! Our plane has a tail, too!

223
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,353
I can't go out there, it's too windy!

224
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,479
Not too worry, Arnold. This will keep you warm
and cozy.

225
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,755
And this will keep you from falling.

226
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,712
You can do it, Arnold.

227
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,791
You've got the experience!

228
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,474
The know-how. The right stuff!

229
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,358
Gee, it's NlCE to be needed!

230
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,473
Whoa! What was that?.!!

231
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,472
I think we're flying over the model airplane show!

232
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:57,473
Actually, Wanda, I think we are lN the show!

233
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,028
We're losing altitude, Arnold!

234
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,711
NO PROBLEM!

235
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,596
AR-NOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLD...!!!

236
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,796
SORRRRRR-RYYYYYYY!!!

237
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,669
WHATEVER YOU DO...DON'T STOP
PEDALLlNG!

238
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:21,154
Huh...Look at that, John! I've never seen a
maneuver like it. Amazing!

239
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,435
Look at all those planes up ahead!

240
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,715
Great! It's the model airplane show!

241
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,349
Tim, look! It's them! They're in the show!

242
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,032
They're also in trouble!

243
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,792
How can you tell?.

244
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,949
'Cause NOBODY'S ever done a triple lmmelman
with a double outside loop!

245
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,794
We've got to save them. DO SOMETHlNG, LlZ!

246
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,392
I hope they see us.

247
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,234
See us?. This plane is so big it could be a planet!

248
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,992
It's Liz! She wants us to land!

249
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,230
Take us down, Wildcat!

250
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,357
Roger, Ms Frizzle. PEDAL!!

251
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,113
I'm getting to pooped to pedal!

252
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,079
Me, too! Next time I want to be the pilot!

253
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:21,079
WE'RE DROPPlNG TOO FAST! BANK LEFT,
ARNOLD...LEFT!

254
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,272
BANKlNG LEFT!

255
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,114
NOSE UP, ARNOLD! NOSE UP!!!

256
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,758
NOSE UP!

257
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:36,192
TOO HlGH, ARNOLD...WE'RE GOlNG TO
STALL! BRlNG DOWN THE ELEVATORS!

258
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,238
ELEVATORS, DOWN...YESSSS!

259
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,357
LEVEL OUT ARNOLD, PEDAL HARDER,GUYS,

260
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,399
WE NEED TO KEEP OUR AlR SPEED UP AND
THE AlR MOVlNG OVER OUR WlNGS!

261
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,358
WE'RE PEDALLlNG! WE'RE PEDALLlNG!!

262
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:54,513
You're doing it, Wildcat! You are flying!

263
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,912
WE'RE COMlN' lN, LlZ! EASE OFF
ELEVATORS, ARNOLD!

264
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,752
EASlNG OFF!

265
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,631
Hold your speed, Tim, they're coming down!

266
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,312
Speed steady!

267
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,713
What an inventive performance!

268
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,516
Way to go, Wanda!

269
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,875
All right, Wildcat!

270
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,349
Hey! Where's Liz?.

271
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,671
WAY TO GO, LlZ!!!

272
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,309
''To both birds and planes wings are a gift,

273
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,119
Air rushing across them gives them a lift''.

274
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,476
But even with wings you need power for speed,

275
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,757
While a propeller must pull for the flight to
succeed. ''

276
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,435
And I must say that steering, I almost forgot,

277
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:02,799
Is what makes you go where you want to...or
not.'' Thank you.

278
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,791
And thank YOU, Wanda.

279
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,871
It gives me great pleasure to present

280
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,953
the Grand Prize for Model Airplane excellence to
you and Tim...

281
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:15,511
not only for constructing a plane with superior
design

282
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,034
and exceptional maneuverability -

283
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:24,036
but for incredible aerobatic ingenuity. What a
show!

284
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,271
Thank you, but this trophy belongs to
EVERYONE in our class.

285
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,113
We couldn't have won it without them. Right, Ms
Frizzle?.

286
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:34,113
Well, as I always say, sometimes you have to do
the wrong stuff -

287
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,317
to find out what the RlGHT stuff really is!

288
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,999
Is it the magic school bus?.

289
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,115
Is it the magic school bus?.

290
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,395
Is it the magic school bus?.

291
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,276
The magic school bus?.

292
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,270
The magic school bus?.

293
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,475
The magic school bus?.

294
00:21:55,560 --> 00:22:01,351
Is it the magic school bus?. Is it the magic school
bus?.

295
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,595
Magic School Bus, the Producer speaking.

296
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:13,389
Hi. I just watched your show on flight and it really
blew me away.

297
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,072
But I do have a few questions.

298
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:15,956
Roger.

299
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,519
My name isn't Roger.

300
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,431
I-l'm not saying it is.

301
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,229
Roger is just another way of saying 'right' or
'okay' in pilot lingo.

302
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,835
Gotcha! Now, about those planes the bus turned
into?.

303
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,276
They were ridiculous! Nobody could've ever flown
them!

304
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,794
Believe it or not, those were real planes.

305
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,031
Uh sure, the first two didn't get off the ground.

306
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,275
But the Wright Flyer was the first airplane to
actually fly!

307
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,109
Okay... I mean, Roger, here's something for you.

308
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,829
Steering a bird or a plane is a lot more
complicated than you showed.

309
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,480
You got that right! Take airplanes, for openers.

310
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:56,269
They have moveable flaps on the wings as well
as on the tail.

311
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,629
Raise one flap up and the other one down -

312
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,632
and the wing rises for a banking turn to the right.

313
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,476
Reverse the flaps, and the plane will bank to the
left.

314
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:12,150
Oh, I get it! But here's something I DON'T get.
How does a BlRD fly?.

315
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,276
Ah! Good question!

316
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,877
The movement of a bird's wing is so complicated
-

317
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,520
it took stop motion photography to figure it out.

318
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,913
Birds use their wings both for lift and for push
forward.

319
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:35,348
Roger! But you didn't say anything about the
hardest part of flying -landing!

320
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,795
Well, we showed it, but we didn't talk about it.

321
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:42,908
To land, you have to slow down and fly close to
the ground reduce your lift

322
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,833
so you slowly sink until your wheels touch the
ground.

323
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:50,516
Then cut the power and apply the brakes.

324
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:54,798
But landing isn't always easy - and even birds
mess up once in a while.

325
00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:00,674
Lizards, too! Hey, thanks for calling the Magic
School Bus.

326
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,876
Keep watching,and keep 'em flying!
