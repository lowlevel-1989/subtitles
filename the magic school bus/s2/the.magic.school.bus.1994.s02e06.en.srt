1
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,355
This is really embarrassing, Wanda.

2
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,317
It's okay, Arnold, you're with me.

3
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,916
What if somebody catches us in here?.

4
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,749
Who's going to catch you in the girls bathroom,
Tiffany?.

5
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,833
Tiffany?. Who's Tiffany?. I don't know any Tiffany.

6
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,718
Yeah, right. Whatever you say, Arnold.

7
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,791
I say we don't need this water!.

8
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,158
My model of the waterworks shows exactly how
water is collected and stored

9
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,593
and cleaned and delivered and-

10
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,910
Yawn burger with a side of snores!.

11
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,959
As your partner, I cannot do a report on water
without water!.

12
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,635
That's enough. I take the bucket to class, you
clean up.

13
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,357
O. K.

14
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,828
Oh, and don't forget Ms Frizzle's keys!. Hi, Tiffany.

15
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,434
Hi, Wanda. Hi, Tiffany.

16
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,119
ARNOLD!.

17
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,309
TlFFANY!.

18
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,672
TlFFANY!. WAlT... I can explain!

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,992
Oh, maybe I should have stayed home today!

20
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,389
Come on, Arnold! It's time for your report!

21
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,358
Yikes! I knew I should have stayed home today.

22
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,477
Careful Wanda! You'll drown my waterworks!

23
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,836
Arnold, a properly constructed waterworks cannot
drown!

24
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,670
WHAT'S THAT NOlSE?.!

25
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,794
Good morning, class.

26
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,791
Good morning, Ms Frizzle.

27
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,833
Ah! Everyone ready to find out where water goes
and what it does?.

28
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,717
Ready when you are, Ms Frizzle.

29
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,156
Actually, I'd rather hit the Surf Ride at Water
land.

30
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,629
Ah! Water land! Of course!

31
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,235
The perfect introduction to our investigation of
water!

32
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,035
Are you suggesting that we really go there?.

33
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,599
I don't see why not.

34
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,159
Yeah! Oh, boy!

35
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,832
What a great idea!

36
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,710
Wait! Going to Water land has nothing to do with
a serious study of water.

37
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,552
Sure it does, Arn.

38
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,871
We could think about a mighty river as we're
riding the Floomerang!

39
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,555
This brochure shows the new Storm cloud
Simulator they just built!

40
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,712
And we could appreciate rainfall on the Raindrop
Parachute Ride!

41
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,313
But what about our report?.

42
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,595
It's all about how we use waterworks

43
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,639
to get clean water where we need it when we
need it. See?.

44
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,598
Ah! It really is quite wonderful, Arnold.

45
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,719
But compared to Water land, it's DRY...
DRY... DRY!

46
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,791
Water's no fun unless you're in it!

47
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,634
Ah, water...what goes around, comes around.

48
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,589
A veritable merry-go-round of moisture! To the
bus!

49
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,113
Yay!

50
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,552
Water land! YAYYYYY!

51
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,872
Wow. Look at the rain gauge. It really rained a
lot!

52
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,111
Yeah, more than two inches in the last hour.

53
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,796
According to my research, that's a school record
for rainfall.

54
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,509
Come on, you guys. We're gonna study some
SERlOUS water!

55
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,799
Wanda, do you have the keys you borrowed from
me?.

56
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,715
Oh! Never mind. I have a spare key...somewhere
in here. I think.

57
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,199
Here it is!

58
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,628
And here we go!

59
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,872
Wait a minute! I have a hunch...this is not...the
way to Water land!

60
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,834
This is a...FlELD DRlllllP!

61
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,877
What happened???.!

62
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,793
Welcome to the REAL Water land!!!

63
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,395
Where EVERYTHlNG is water! Even us!

64
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,351
I HATE getting wet!

65
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,989
As I always say, Arnold, a little water never hurt
anyone.

66
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,116
This is awesome!

67
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,273
I hope we're not going to stay in this rain gauge
all day - that would be boring!

68
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,430
And we wouldn't want that...

69
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,195
Is it just me - or is it getting really warm?.

70
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,910
Ms Frizzle, what happens when water gets
warm?. Do I really want to know?.

71
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,875
Gosh! I'm rising into the air!

72
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,110
WHOAAAA...SEE¡®YA!

73
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,478
Ralphie! Is it just you or are we ALL FLOATlNG
into the air???.!

74
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:43,874
When water is warmed by the sun...it
evapora-a-a-ates!

75
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,110
You mean, we're EVAPORATlNG???.!

76
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,713
Hellllp!

77
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:29,195
At least being water meant we stayed on the
ground! I want to be water again!

78
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,671
We still ARE water, Arnold. When water
evaporates, it turns into water VAPOR!

79
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,193
It's a gas, Arnold!

80
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,713
We've been VAPORlZED!

81
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:42,437
I get it! First we were a liquid -then we became a
gas! I still don't like it.

82
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,273
ah-ah-CHOOOOOO! It's getting c-c-c-c-cold up
here!

83
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:54,356
Hey! I'm un-vaporizing!Look at my hand!I'm
turning into tiny droplets!

84
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,513
That's because we're changing back into a liquid.
We're condensing!

85
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,114
Water is as water does!

86
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,559
Ms Frizzle! You turned into a clouuuuud!

87
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,480
Ohhh! Isn't this heavenly?.!

88
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,599
Wow! I never knew a cloud was water, too!

89
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,830
Hey! We're moving...!!!

90
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,638
This is Fantastic!

91
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,318
DUCK!

92
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,475
It's not easy being a cloud.

93
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,038
NOW where are we goiiiiiiiiiing...!

94
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,079
Wherever we're going?. It looks to me like it's not
our choice.

95
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:39,110
As someone once said "Clouds are the playful
fancies of the mighty wind."

96
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,078
Does that mean that clouds go wherever the wind
takes them?.

97
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,674
In a word, Keesha...YYYYYES!

98
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,389
Oh bad oh bad oh bad bad bad!

99
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,994
Then we could end up ANYwhere!!!

100
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,039
Right as rain, Arnold! Water goes EVERYwhere!

101
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,831
OHHHH, NOOOOO!!

102
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:18,437
I always wondered what it would be like to be a
cloud! I love it!

103
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,119
Hey, watch it!

104
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,794
Lighten up, Arnold! You're a cloud!

105
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,677
Now we're one BlG cloud!

106
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,790
But clouds don't go to school!Clouds don't give
reports - they stay in the air!

107
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:36,831
We'll NEVER get dow-ow-ow......ownnnn!Oh
nooo!

108
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,909
Arnold?.

109
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,716
We fell out of the cloud!

110
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,554
Water ALWAYS falls out of the
clouds...eventually!

111
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,789
It's raining!

112
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,155
WE are the rain, Phoebe!

113
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,756
This is even better than the Raindrop Parachute
Ride!!

114
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,638
Hope you don't mind our dropping by-eee!

115
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,550
Hey! A Frizzle Drizzle! Ha ha.

116
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,036
Go with the flow, class!

117
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,510
Wait for us, Ms Frizzle!

118
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,195
We're outta control!

119
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,998
Don't worry, Arnold!

120
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,312
Wanda, we're thousands of miles from school,
raining into some strange forest.

121
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:32,111
We're almost on the ground, and then we'll
stahhhh...

122
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,428
OR NOT!

123
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,512
Is it true that water always runs downhill?.

124
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,199
YES!

125
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,191
OH, NO!

126
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:45,832
Waterworks, water runs...waterfalls...

127
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,117
LOOK OUT BELOW!

128
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,910
Where's all this water going in such a hurry?.

129
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,788
Water always flows to the lowest spot, Phoebe!
And we're almost there!

130
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,038
THE OCEAN?.

131
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,072
Well, that was an interesting field trip. Can we go
back now, Ms Frizzle?.

132
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,788
Oh I'd like to help you out, Arnold, but...

133
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:54,078
Oh, no! We're evaporating again!

134
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,111
I love this part!

135
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,512
Who knows what happens next?. Hands?.

136
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,314
We c-c-condense into water droplets.

137
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,834
But we've b-b-been there! D-done that!

138
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,913
And it won't be the last time, Arnold! What
happens next?.

139
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,228
We become clouds!

140
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,158
Then we get blown who-knows-where by the
wind.

141
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,797
Ah! And next?.

142
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,432
And fall somewhere else as rain again.

143
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,592
Ahh! Excellent observation, Wanda!!

144
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,834
Are you suggesting that water never, ever stops
moving?. EVER???.!

145
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,833
In the words of my Great Aunt Mathilda...

146
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,909
NO Here we go again!

147
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:45,314
You mean, water keeps evaporating -condensing
- raining -collecting... FOREVER?????.!

148
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,598
Ah! Bingo! That's why its movement is called the
water CYCLE!

149
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,035
But water has to go somewhere!

150
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:58,468
It does! It goes around and around and around
and around...

151
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,154
We could be water for the rest of our lives!

152
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,108
We could stay stuck in the water cycle forever!

153
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,118
Wait a minute! This is a field trip, right?.

154
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,239
I mean, we've got to get back by three
o'clock...don't we?.

155
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:21,269
Oh, no! It's already three o'clock. I'm gonna miss
batting practice!

156
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,271
And I've got a dance lesson!

157
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,069
Not to worry, mates. It's only three o'clock in
London.

158
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,388
LONDON?.

159
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,877
How do we get outta here?.!

160
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:45,999
I've got it, Ms Frizzle! Since you're the one who
turned us lNTO water,

161
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,832
just turn us back into regular KlDS!

162
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,912
Ah! Unfortunately, Keesha,

163
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,989
I can't do that

164
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,595
because the key I used to turn us all into water is
ALSO water!

165
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,830
Well, don't you have another key?.

166
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,831
Would you care to take that one, Wanda?.

167
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,751
Well, I um... I borrowed Ms Frizzle's keys

168
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:08,595
when Arnold and I um went into the uh girls
bathroom um...Arnold?.

169
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:13,879
I... uh, l... I left the key in the bathroom.

170
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,599
AR-NOLLLLD!!!

171
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,469
But that's not all. I also forgot to empty the sink...

172
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:25,510
And I think I forgot to turn the water off all the
way. What if the whole school is flooded?.

173
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,194
Arnold! How could you?.!

174
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:32,114
Well,... if, if we'd just done our reports in the first
place -

175
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,599
none of this would've happened!

176
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,194
LOOK OUT!!!TAxl CAB AT 3 O'CLOCK!!

177
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,999
What do we do now?.!

178
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:43,119
Remember the water cycle! What comes after
raindrops?.

179
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,316
EVAPORATlON!

180
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,277
That was close!

181
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,708
I knew I should've stayed home today!

182
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,114
It's cloud time again you guys!

183
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,877
Seems to me, the only way out of the water
cycle... is to stop being water!

184
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,798
Ah! An absorbing solution, Keesha.

185
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:14,158
I've got it! Clouds are water and can go
everywhere, right?.!

186
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,117
Wherever the wind blows, Wanda.

187
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,636
So what if we could blow our clouds wherever we
want to go?.

188
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,870
I think that could be arranged.

189
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,430
Awesome! The bus can blow us back to school!

190
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,988
Then we can rain down, find the spare key...

191
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,752
and stop being water!

192
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,673
And I can turn off the faucet and save the school!

193
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,391
Here we go!

194
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,355
IT'S OUR SCHOOL!

195
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,919
And it's not flooded!

196
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,672
I'll get the key!

197
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,396
Almost there!...WHOOPS!

198
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,558
LlZ! Where's the key?.!

199
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,193
LlZ!

200
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,631
Here we are, Wanda!

201
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,113
Did you see the key?.

202
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,758
That's not all I saw!

203
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,594
The bathroom's flooding - and Liz is stuck in the
faucet!

204
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,511
Maybe she was trying to escape!

205
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,477
We've got to get inside!

206
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,393
But how?. We're only water.

207
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,233
I KNOW! The waterworks!

208
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,197
THE WATERWORKS?.

209
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,989
The REAL waterworks - the one my model is
modeled after!

210
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,152
It gets water to where we need it! And we're
water -

211
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,549
and we're needed in the girls bathroom!

212
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,278
And I know how to get us there!

213
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,834
Arnold! You're a genius!

214
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,875
I am?.

215
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,356
To the waterworks!

216
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,839
The reservoir!

217
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:42,193
That's where the water is stored and that's where
the waterworks start!

218
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,320
Class... prepare to rain!

219
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:55,437
There's no turning back now! We're in the
reservoir!

220
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,515
At last I get to give my report!

221
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,756
According to Arnold's research

222
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:05,276
a reservoir is where the water we drink is
collected.

223
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:10,468
Arnold, if this is the water we drink it's pretty
disgusting!

224
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:15,395
Yeah! It's full of dirt - Yuck! I can't believe we
drink this stuff!

225
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,709
Things are sure getting mixed up in here but it
doesn't look any cleaner.

226
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,190
Yeah, Arnold. What is this white stuff?. More
junk?.

227
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,989
Actually, it's alum - and if you'd look closely,

228
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,674
Carlos, you'll note that the dirt is actually sticking
to it

229
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,671
and thereby cleaning the water!

230
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,039
It tickles!

231
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:47,233
Yeah, but now the water is full of alum blobs!

232
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,151
How do we get rid of this stuff?.

233
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,194
This way to the settling basin!

234
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:04,475
Look, the dirty alum is settling to the bottom! And
up here! The water's clear!

235
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,753
Are we clean yet?.

236
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:12,392
Almost! We need to get filtered!On to the filtration
tank, class!

237
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,989
We will now filter through the sand and gravel
which you see below you

238
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,833
to get rid of any tiny particles which may have
slipped through

239
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,549
the cleansing process... so we can get really,
really clean!

240
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,595
Let's go!

241
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,234
HELP!

242
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,915
Gee, thanks, Ms Frizzle.

243
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,596
Ah! Anytime, Arnold. Don't let this DAMPEN your
enthusiasm!

244
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,676
Hey, Arnold, now that we're clean, how much
further to the girls bathroom?.

245
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,115
Ah...this pipe should lead to the school!

246
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,432
C'mon you guys!

247
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,913
Are we there yet?.

248
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,069
Almost!

249
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,149
LOOK!A SEA MONSTER!

250
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:46,072
WAlT! That tail looks familiar! Why it's...

251
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:56,678
IT'S LlZ! LlZ! IT'S US! WE'RE lNSlDE THE
FAUCET! YOU CAN PULL YOUR TAlL OUT
NOW!

252
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,879
It must be stuck!

253
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,236
I hate to do this Liz, but it has to be done!

254
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,995
Hang tennnnn...

255
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,676
Hey, your bathroom is way nicer than ours!

256
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:34,639
Liz, quick! Get the key ring before we evaporate
again!

257
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,390
Only one problem, there's not enough room in
here to transform the bus!

258
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,113
TlFFANY!

259
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,312
Tiffany! Are you okay?.

260
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,357
I think so?. What happened?.

261
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:24,473
Heh, heh. Well, I guess you could say our field
trip made a real. SPLASH!

262
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:31,074
Well, as I always say, to appreciate the water
cycle,

263
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,720
you've got to have a good sense of humid!

264
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,831
MS FRlZ-ZLLLLLE!

265
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,958
Is it the magic school bus?.

266
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,189
Is it the magic school bus?.

267
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,429
The magic school bus?.

268
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,350
Is it the magic school bus?.

269
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,589
Is it the magic school bus?.

270
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,999
The magic school bus?.

271
00:21:55,080 --> 00:22:00,757
The magic school bus?.

272
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:49,553
No, this is another kid. I have a question about
the water cycle.

273
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,631
Water collects, evaporates...

274
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,473
condenses and rains. I know, I know.

275
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,915
But you made it seem like it happens in a few
minutes.

276
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,310
Sometimes, the water cycle can take weeks or
years.

277
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:03,796
You're right! And water frozen into a glacier can
take

278
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:07,111
as many as 1 0,000 years before it melts again!

279
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,829
Which reminds me. My mother keeps telling me
to conserve water -

280
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:14,799
But two-thirds of the earth's surface is water, so
how could we ever run out?.

281
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,031
We won't. While there's plenty of water in the
world -

282
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,839
it's not always WHERE we want it - WHEN we
want it.

283
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,912
In fact, only a tiny part of the earth's water is
drinkable.

284
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,115
Really?.

285
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:30,433
That's right. So we have to watch how we use it
and be careful not to waste it.

286
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:34,593
Hey!! Haven't YOU ever forgotten to turn off the
water?.

287
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,990
Sure, but that doesn't make it okay.

288
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,672
I - I agree.

289
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,997
And I promise you Arnold will never do it again.

290
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,959
I heard that one leaky faucet can waste several
gallons of water a day.

291
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,075
That's true.

292
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,234
By the way, you never explained how a cloud
snows.

293
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,029
Oh, you'll have to watch our show on ¡®Weather'
to find out the answer to that.

294
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:04,070
Thanks for calling. Come on, Liz, let's go home.
It's been a long day.
