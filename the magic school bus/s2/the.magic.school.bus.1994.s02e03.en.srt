1
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,469
Isthere really a dinosaur here, Dr. Skeledon?.

2
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,798
Come on over here, kids!.

3
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,749
Well, there she is!. What do you think?.

4
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,799
Wow!. A real live dinosaur!.

5
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,633
Actually, Ralphie, it's dead.

6
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,995
But what are they doing to it?.

7
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,753
Digging up and dust-busting the fossilized bones

8
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,478
of dinosaurs is the only way

9
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,199
we paleontologists have of tuning in on

10
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,999
what a BONE-afide dinosaur really looked like...

11
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,470
So that's just another DOA, Dr. Skeledon?.

12
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,549
A DOA?.

13
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,756
A dinosaur outta action.

14
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,512
Actually, Carlos, it's a TROA: a Tyrannosaurus
Rex outta action!

15
00:01:54,760 --> 00:02:01,029
Wow, a T. Rex! The killer of the killers, the
meanest of the mean!

16
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,914
I don't think dinosaurs are so terrible.

17
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,669
Then how come the word dinosaur means
¡®terrible lizard'?.

18
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,592
According to my research, dinosaurs WERE NOT
lizards.

19
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,194
That's right, Dorothy Ann, they WEREN'T,

20
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,836
but they WERE reptiles, just like the lizards of
today.

21
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,513
And most of them weren't very terrible.

22
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,397
How do we really know?.

23
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,153
Dinosaurs became extinct so long ago,

24
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,117
no human being ever saw one.

25
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,997
Even if they could have seen one,

26
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,911
they wouldn't have lived to tell about it!

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,673
Now, what makes you so sure of that, Carlos?.

28
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,272
MS FRlZZLE!

29
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,312
A teacher-saurus!

30
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,598
Anyone know what you call a 65 million year old
dinosaur egg?.

31
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,308
EGG-stink. Get it?. Extinct?.

32
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,591
Good yoke, Ms Frizzle.

33
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,269
So, everyone digging the dig?.

34
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,351
Yeah, cool! It's great! We love it!

35
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,557
From the looks of things, Valerie, you really got
into it yourself.

36
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,873
Just like old times, huh, Carmina?.

37
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,077
Like the time we went to Scotland in search of
the Loch Ness Monster.

38
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,515
That must have been in pre-historic times.

39
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,431
I heard that Arnold!

40
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,878
Here, Bonesy, add this to your collection.

41
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,473
Fantabulous! One of the best examples of

42
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,835
a fossilized egg I've ever seen.

43
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,519
Ah! Come along class... Sorry to dig and run,
Bonesy...

44
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:36,037
...but we have to get back. Thanks for a peek at
the past.

45
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,190
Oh! What are old friends for, Val?.

46
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,238
¡®Leave no stone unturned' - that's my motto!

47
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:46,235
Speaking of stones, Dr. Skeledon, can I see that
rock... I mean egg?.

48
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:51,155
Sure, Arnold. Just be careful with it. We don't
find many of these.

49
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,838
I have some great rocks at home, but nothing like
this one!

50
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,239
Too bad we couldn't find a

51
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,039
real live T. Rex instead of that rock!

52
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:04,313
Just think about it...all that fighting and
slaughtering!

53
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,630
Now THAT woulda been a field trip!

54
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,269
As far as I'm concerned, the only safe dinosaur

55
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,759
is a dead dinosaur!

56
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,197
Come on, you guys, dinosaurs couldn't have
been THAT mean!

57
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,191
Get real, Phoebe!

58
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,238
Dinosaurs are the biggest and meanest animals
that ever lived.

59
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,198
You know, Carlos, to REALLY understand a
dinosaur,

60
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,556
you need to walk in its shoes. Isn't that right,
Bonesy?.

61
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,312
With knobs on it, Val!

62
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,356
DR. ¡®S'! Come quick!

63
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,112
Bye kids, I'm history!

64
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,272
WAlT! DR. SKELEDON! YOUR ROCK!

65
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,558
Buckle up, Arnold!

66
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,870
But I've still got Dr. Skeledon's rock!

67
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,713
You'll have plenty of time to give it to her when
we get back.

68
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,911
Get back?????. Why do I have a sneaking
suspicion...

69
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,752
As I always say,

70
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,594
you can turn the clock back, if you've got the right
hands.

71
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,475
Right, Liz?. Here we go!!

72
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,599
Is it just me or did someone hit rewind?.

73
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,750
The dig is un-digging!

74
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,990
We're going back in time!

75
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,392
Wow! We've never done this before!

76
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,718
Whoa, at this rate, we're gonna be unborn!

77
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,758
Now I'll never know what I was going to be when l
grow up!

78
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,628
On the other hand, Phoebe, there's no time like
the past

79
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,350
to take chances - make mistakes - and GET
MESSY!

80
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,469
Why is it so cold?.

81
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,589
Because we're back in the l-lce Age!

82
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,750
That was a million years ago!

83
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,397
Isn't there somewhere warmer we can go, Ms
Frizzle?.

84
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,234
Not someWHERE, Wanda...someWHEN!

85
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,716
I think we're breaking the reverse time travel
speed limit!

86
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,072
Look! The volcano! IT'S UNERUPTlNG!

87
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,832
We're almost there!

88
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,558
Just a few... million...years...to...go!

89
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,835
Goodness gracious! We've reached the Late
Cretaceous!

90
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,994
We've gone back so far back in time that

91
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:51,392
Dr. Skeledon's rock has unfossilized back into an
egg!

92
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,789
What did you EGGS-pect, Arnold?.

93
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,519
Once an egg - always an egg!

94
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,479
But what's Dr. Skeledon going to say!

95
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,356
Now, don't worry, Arnold,

96
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,477
you've got plenty of time -- millions of years, in
fact!

97
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,358
Now let's get out there and EXPLORE!

98
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,430
The best thing about time travel is

99
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,272
that it's easy on the tires.

100
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,715
Ms Frizzle... How far back have we come?.

101
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,796
Oh... 67 million years... give or take a month or
two...

102
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,310
67 MlLLlON YEARS!

103
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,908
That means we'll probably see...

104
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,271
DlNOSAURS...!!!

105
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,479
RUN...!

106
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,877
OH... NO!!

107
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,912
Thanks, Liz. Dr. Skeledon wouldn't

108
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,036
have been very happy if her egg broke.

109
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,715
I wonder what kind of dinosuar laid an egg this
big?.

110
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,789
What?.

111
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,558
Hang on, Phoebe!

112
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,677
I'm trying! Aah!

113
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,752
Come back with my egg, you thief -it doesn't
belong to you!

114
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,237
Come to think of it... It doesn't belong to me,
either!

115
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,708
AR-NOLD...!

116
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,512
Now, now, don't play with your food, little
Alamosaurus.

117
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,752
Oh bad oh bad oh bad bad bad bad bad!

118
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,391
Hurry, before it eats us for lunch!

119
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,517
Seems to me, it wants to eat the leaves - not us!

120
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,591
Tim, they're still DlNOSAURS...

121
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,434
ferocious, mean, nasty, DlE-NO-SAURS!

122
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,873
Quick! Onto the bus before they come back!

123
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:15,351
But Ralphie, I think they're plant-eaters, not
meat-eaters!

124
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,671
Yeah! But what if they're just taking a break
between the salad and

125
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,557
the main course... US!

126
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:24,913
I don't know, Carlos. I think maybe salad WAS
the main course!

127
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,036
A perplexing proposition, isn't it?.

128
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,588
Are dinosaurs ferocious or friendly?.

129
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,515
Sweet or savage?. What is it, Liz?.

130
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,793
Arnold?. Phoebe?.

131
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,276
An Ornithomimus???.

132
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:47,231
See, I knew this would happen. The dinos did
them in!!!

133
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,189
Any sign of them, Dorothy Ann?.

134
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,679
Not yet.

135
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,638
What was that?.

136
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,995
The sound of a hungry dinosaur ordering

137
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,559
an Arnold-burger.

138
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,392
And Phoebe-fries...to go!

139
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,519
The noise is coming from a bunch of
Parasaurolophus

140
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,433
drinking water and eating plants.

141
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,830
Maybe those monsters already ate Arnold and
Phoebe,

142
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,239
clothes and all!

143
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:26,071
How can you even think that?. They're just
minding their own business.

144
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,751
Yeah, sure. Now they're washing ¡®em down with
a drink of water.

145
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,114
You heartless--

146
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,590
Carlos, did you ever think maybe they're just
thirsty?.!

147
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,116
YEAH! Bloodthirsty for Arnold!

148
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,316
Come back here, you egg-napper!!!

149
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,035
Uh, nice dinosaur. Good boy.

150
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,875
...You think he's a plant eater or, or a meat
eater?.

151
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,191
I don't know. Maybe he only eats eggs.

152
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,918
And little kids!

153
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,118
Come on, Arnold, let him go. It's just an egg.

154
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:09,558
But it's Dr. Skeledon's egg! And it's up to me to
get it back to her!

155
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,152
Gee, what a guy!

156
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,388
According to my research, those horn things help
them to--

157
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,471
Stab their innocent victims!

158
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,195
No Carlos! Help them make NOlSES!

159
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,759
Is it really noise?.

160
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,479
Maybe its their way of talking to each other.

161
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,710
Talking to each other?.! Yeah, right,

162
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,918
they're saying "Mmm-mmmm! That guy with the
glasses was good!

163
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,594
Actually, I think they're talking about us!

164
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,240
Now, class, let's not time-travel to

165
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,992
any hasty conclusions.

166
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,559
Ms Frizzle's right.

167
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,790
They're not acting like bloodthirsty killers.

168
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,950
Chock up another vegetarian, Liz!

169
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,918
Hey, look! There's Arnold and Phoebe!

170
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,831
They're still alive!

171
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,279
Let me see!

172
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,195
That critter they're chasing looks awful small to
be a dinosaur.

173
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,999
Oh! Don't judge an Ornithomiumus by its cover,
Carlos!

174
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,833
Dinosaurs come in all shapes and sizes.

175
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,480
Hey! If we could just send a message to those

176
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,915
Parawhatchamacallits to get out of the way,

177
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,594
we could get across the river and save Arnold
and Phoebe!

178
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,233
Dino-mite idea, Carlos!

179
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,192
WHA-HOOOOOO...!

180
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,388
It worked!

181
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,595
They're leaving!

182
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,878
They got the message!

183
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:53,155
Over the river and through the woods, to Arnold's
and Phoebe's rescue we go...

184
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,798
Oops... maybe NOT!

185
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,313
Where are we?.

186
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,992
Look! Eggshells!

187
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,514
It kinda looks like a nest I once found.

188
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,992
EGGS-actamento, Wanda! And since most of
these shells are pretty trampled,

189
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,594
I'd say the babies hatched a few months ago.

190
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,670
What kind of babies?.

191
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,154
Big ones!!!

192
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,117
And here comes Mama.

193
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,148
It doesn't look to me like she wants to fight.

194
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,959
Maybe she thinks we're her babies

195
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,430
and just wants to take care of us like a good
mother should.

196
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:38,672
If she sees us - she'll eat us! Dive for cover!

197
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,593
Oh, no, what if she wants to...

198
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,318
... FEED US!

199
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,631
Grrrross...!

200
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,549
Berries that have been chewed and spewed

201
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,631
are nutritious... and delicious...

202
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,553
...and the babies just love a good A-B-C fruit
salad!

203
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,029
What's an A-B-C fruit salad?.

204
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,111
ALREADY BEEN CHEWED!

205
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,595
I say we make a run for it before we're D-E-F!

206
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,636
D-E-F?. What's that?.

207
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,269
Digested, eliminated and forgotten!

208
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,114
Carlos, wait! They're not meat-eaters. They're
even good mothers!

209
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,679
Come along, class!

210
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,033
Are you sure that dinosaur came up this way?.

211
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,912
I'm only sure of one thing, Phoebe.

212
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,310
If someone would have told me that I'd be
chasing a hungry dinosaur -

213
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,710
I would have gotten off the bus a few million
years sooner!

214
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,752
I knew the bus would be around here
somewhere.

215
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,235
Looks like it made some friends!

216
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,880
Friends! Are you kidding! Come on,

217
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,713
we've got to find Arnold and Phoebe before it's
too late!

218
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,949
Before those dinos---

219
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,238
Don't say it, Carlos. The Triceratops won't hurt
us.

220
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,880
They're plant eaters, just like the others.

221
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,598
Here you go, little one!

222
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,034
Uh oh...

223
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,477
It's a pack of troodons! And they DO eat meat!

224
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,711
No kidding! That's not a head of lettuce he's
chasing!

225
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,676
Oh bad!

226
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:34,239
Cool! The Troodons can't get to the baby
Triceratops

227
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,356
because the big ones are protecting it!

228
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,350
Oh good!

229
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,991
But they CAN get us!

230
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,356
Not with these, they can't!

231
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,512
Tricerashields! My own little invention, of course!

232
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,359
What are they doing now?.

233
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,955
They're trying to figure out which one of us to eat
first!

234
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,199
I don't think so, Carlos,

235
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,874
Iooks to me like they want an easy lunch without
a fight.

236
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:10,072
The horns scared them away! They were afraid
of getting hurt.

237
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,630
Phoebe, THE EGG! It's next to that big rock!

238
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,153
Now Dr. Skeledon won't be mad at me. It's stuck!

239
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,752
Something tells me we shouldn't be here!

240
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,319
Like what?.

241
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,718
Like THAT!!!

242
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,552
RUN...!

243
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,635
OH, NO...!

244
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,959
What's that noise?.

245
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,473
Sounds like thunder!

246
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,711
Whatever it is, it's scaring the Triceratops.

247
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,874
STAMPEDE...!

248
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,913
That's the last stampede I want to be in!

249
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,072
Yeah, we coulda been dino-dust!

250
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,469
But the Triceratops weren't after us.

251
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,835
They just wanted to get away from the Troodons.

252
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,956
Well... we still have to find Phoebe and--

253
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,470
ARNOLD!!!

254
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,033
There's the bus, Arnold... FASTER!

255
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,390
Is it just me, or is that a real, live Tyrannosaurus
Rex behind them?.

256
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,357
Correctosaurus, Ralphie,

257
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,228
and the T.Rex was the biggest meat-eater of all
time!

258
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,311
Or should I say, lS!

259
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,754
C'MON!!

260
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,716
HURRY!!

261
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,199
YOU CAN MAKE lT!!!

262
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,109
OH NO! I'M DEAD MEAT NOW!

263
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,315
ARNOLD!

264
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,916
He's gonna eat us!

265
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,314
WHOA! Dino breath!

266
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,915
Oh, baaad! When was the last time you
brushed???.!

267
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,595
HELP!

268
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,198
GO AWAY!

269
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,511
Hmmm, wonder if this insurance policy covers
dino-damage?.

270
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,109
Hey, you big bully! Leave my class alone!!

271
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,760
Why doesn't he pick on someone his own size?.!

272
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,353
Maybe he's on a diet.

273
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,910
Maybe he's afraid he'd get hurt - remember the
Troodons?.

274
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,519
Ah! You know, this would be the

275
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,798
perfect opportunity to study the digestive system
of a T. Rex.

276
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,917
MS FRlZZLE! DO SOMETHlNG!!!

277
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,271
Okay, class...think big!

278
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,028
Oh, great! Nothing happened!!

279
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,352
Excuse me.

280
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,919
ARNOLD?.!!

281
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,195
You can put that bus down, now.

282
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,235
GET ¡®lM, ARNOLD!

283
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,275
GlVE lT TO ¡®lM!

284
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,035
Come on, short arms. Put up your dukes!

285
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,549
Thank you.

286
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,878
Oh, yeah?.!

287
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,358
Gee, the T.Rex doesn't act so tough against
someone his own size.

288
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,310
Yay!!

289
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,717
Way to go, Arnold!!

290
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,789
You did it!!

291
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,235
Boy, did you look mean, Arnold.

292
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,038
But we all know you're really not.

293
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,156
And you didn't even have to throw a punch.

294
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,631
You know something, I don't think the T.Rex
wanted to fight anymore than I did.

295
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,837
And he CERTAlNLY didn't want to take any
chances!

296
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,194
OR get messy!

297
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,110
One thing's for sure,

298
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,158
there are a lot more plant-eating dinosaurs than
meat-eaters.

299
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,750
And those that DO eat meat aren't bloodthirsty
monsters.

300
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,150
Yeah, they're just looking for a quick meal without
getting hurt.

301
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,677
So I guess you guys are right. Dinosaurs aren't
so mean after all.

302
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,593
And I can give Dr. Skeledon back her egg.

303
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,070
... Except I'm too big to fit into the bus.

304
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,277
With a few adjustments, you could BE the bus!

305
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,913
RAL-PHlE!

306
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,150
Well, time to go small!

307
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,151
It's a good thing you didn't stay home today,
Arnold.

308
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:39,279
Well, I'll sure be glad when this is a rock again -

309
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,112
it's a lot safer.

310
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,909
Let's go class! We've got a long drive back to
school!

311
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,794
Yeah, like 67 million years!

312
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,398
Fun sure flies when you're having a good TlME!

313
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:13,310
DR. SKELEDON... I almost forgot to give you
back your egg.

314
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,153
I'm sure it was safe with you, Arnold. Thanks.

315
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,992
Up here, Dr. ¡®S'!

316
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,152
What an unusual geologic formation.

317
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,915
I wonder what strange creature left that?.

318
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,914
I'd say it was a Sneakersaurus!

319
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,592
CARLOS!

320
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,112
Is it the magic school bus?.

321
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,189
Is it the magic school bus?.

322
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,315
The magic school bus?.

323
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,355
Is it the magic school bus?.

324
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,555
Is it the magic school bus?.

325
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,755
The magic school bus?.

326
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,149
The magic school bus?.

327
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,035
Hello?. Is this the Magic School Bus?.

328
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,437
For me?. Hello. This is Dr. Carmina Skeledon
speaking.

329
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,796
Is this the Dr. Skeledon that was just on the
Magic School Bus show?.

330
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,314
Why, yes! What can I do for you?.

331
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,278
Well, I've been trying to reach the Producer but
he's all tied up

332
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,158
and I have some probing questions about the
Dinosaur show I just saw.

333
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,036
Dig away.

334
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:34,238
First of all, everyone knows that nobody's ever
seen a real live dinosaur.

335
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,232
You're absolutely right. But we do see lots of
fossils

336
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,595
of the bones which made up their skeletons.

337
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,797
Okay, so then how can you say which dinosaurs
were herbivores

338
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,029
and which were carnivores?.

339
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:47,112
Oh! That's easy! Fossil teeth!

340
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,919
The plant eaters, you see, had flat grinding teeth

341
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,275
and the meat eaters had pointy cutting teeth.

342
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,119
Well, thank you for calling! Goodbye!

343
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,595
Kids these days, they are just so inquisitive!

344
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,315
Hello?.

345
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,233
Hi. I was wondering if nobody's ever seen a real,

346
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,709
Iive dinosaur then how could you possibly know
that

347
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,916
a Parasaurolophus made a noise like this?.

348
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,113
Oh! That's very good! And you are right -

349
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,078
no one knows exactly how dinosaurs behaved
OR

350
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,513
what they sounded like.

351
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,876
You see, we use our imaginations and make
educated guesses.

352
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,713
So all that stuff about the T. Rex not being so
mean

353
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,950
was another one of your educated guesses,
right?.

354
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,429
Absolutely right. Thanks for calling.

355
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:34,638
Wait a minute! So no one's ever travelled back in
time and seen real dinosaurs?.

356
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,678
Absolutely not. Time travel is impossible.

357
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,239
Even for Ms Frizzle?.

358
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,190
Even for Ms Frizzle...

359
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,633
Thanks a lot, Doc!

360
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,516
Like it or not, I don't think even Ms. Frizzle could
go back in time...

361
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:53,720
Still, it would make a good field trip... IF it were
possible...

362
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,958
but of course it's not.
