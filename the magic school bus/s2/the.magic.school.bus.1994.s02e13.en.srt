1
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,599
Good morning! And welcome to the weekend
edition of lN YOUR FACE!

2
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:22,589
The only TV show that asks the question: What's
REALLY going on here?

3
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,990
I'm your host, Gerri Poveri. This just in!

4
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,038
The Monster of Walker Lake has just surfaced
again!

5
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,278
Mom, hurry... Iook! The Monster's back!

6
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,235
This I've got to see!

7
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,279
Here is an exclusive photo of the monster as it
reappeared this morning

8
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,430
at the crack of dawn!

9
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,556
Whoa... unreal!

10
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,631
I couldn't agree with you more, Wanda.

11
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,996
Gerri Poveri would do anything for a story -

12
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,150
even if it means making it up!

13
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,950
But Mom, what if the monster is real?.

14
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,110
What if l, Wanda Lee...

15
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,671
am the first person to make contact with the
Monster of Walker Lake.

16
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,478
Oh no! My whole class beat me to it!

17
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,869
How come the monster never came up before
now?.

18
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,030
Maybe it came up because it was hungry.

19
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,032
May be so, Feeb. But if I were a monster,

20
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,556
it would take a lot more than a banana to get ME
back to the surface!

21
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,996
Okay, but if it lS hungry - we have to feed it.

22
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,039
If it won't come up for the banana, I'll send the
banana down to it.

23
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,239
Oh, no! A banana floats!

24
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,834
That's OK. I like banana splits better.

25
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,114
CARLOS!

26
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,634
Well, if I can't get the monster to come up here.

27
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,070
I'll send my camera down there!

28
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,076
Hey, my monster-cam floats, too! Who would've
guessed?.

29
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,832
If we want to see that monster,

30
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,356
we'd better find a way to turn these floaters into
sinkers!

31
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,274
Maybe we should use my mother's calzone
instead of a banana -

32
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,237
they go down like rocks!

33
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,519
Did you see it yet?. Did you TOUCH it?.

34
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,198
What took you so long?. We thought you'd be the
first one here.

35
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,472
Yeah, well I'm going to be the first one down
there!

36
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,233
I'm going to the bottom of the lake to find the
monster!

37
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,835
I don't know, Wanda. hat would Ms Frizzle say?.

38
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,515
It's the weekend, Phoebe. No school. No Ms
Frizzle.

39
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,796
Look look! Oh, look! It's coming toward us!

40
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,352
THE MONSTER!

41
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,272
Good morning, class!

42
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,078
MS FRlZZLE!

43
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,355
Nothing like a dip in the deep!

44
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,908
Are you looking for the monster, too, Ms Frizzle!?.

45
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,150
Well, if you don't look, you'll never see!

46
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,038
And what you don't see can be very hard to find.

47
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,638
You look like you have that sinking feeling,
Wanda.

48
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,836
Want to float something past me?.

49
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,993
Gerri Poveri showed a picture of the monster on
TV! It HAS to be true!

50
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,230
Pictures CAN be faked, you know!

51
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:04,598
To prove it's really real, you need evidence... and
there isn't any.

52
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,877
And what do you do when there isn't any
evidence?.

53
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,075
Go home?.

54
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:13,358
No, you look for it! I'm going after the monster
myself!

55
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:19,116
This is a warning! Monster alert! Stay out of the
water.

56
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,873
I repeat, stay out of the water.

57
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,916
Hey! It's Gerri Poveri!

58
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,799
For updates on the Monster of Walker Lake,

59
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,316
watch the next edition of "ln Your Face"!

60
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:36,555
YOU HEARD ME FOLKS...STAY OUT OF THE
WATER! RETURN TO THE SAFETY OF YOUR
HOMES!

61
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,756
Wait a second! She doesn't own this lake!

62
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,674
We can look for the monster if we want to! Can't
we, Ms Frizzle?.

63
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:48,596
Not only that - we can take chances, make
mistakes get wet!

64
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,831
Hey! Is it just me, or does this sound like a field
trip?.

65
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,708
I propose an underwater expedition to learn the
whole truth

66
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,712
and nothing but the truth about this monster!

67
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,711
A splashing idea, Wanda!

68
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,237
HlT lT, LlZ!

69
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,873
All right!

70
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,758
Cool! An underwater field trip!

71
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,949
Ready to dive Ms Frizzle?.

72
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,600
Ready but unable, Wanda.

73
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,671
Oh! The sinker linker's rusted.

74
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,716
Somebody forgot to swab the deck

75
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,553
and dry the sinker linker the last time we went
under.

76
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,710
Without it, we can't sink at least not
automatically...

77
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,429
But we've got to get down there! This is our
chance to make history!

78
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,192
BE history, you mean!

79
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,589
As my Uncle Wilbur used to say,

80
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,878
"Uh, you can lead a bus to water - but you can't
make it sink."

81
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,272
Yes we can, Ms Frizzle! There's got to be way!

82
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,712
Let's see...the banana floats and the rock sinks.

83
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:10,318
They're the same size, but the banana is light,
and the rock is heavy.

84
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,400
If something is heavy enough, it sinks. What will
a banana-rock do?.

85
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,072
If something is heavy enough, it sinks. What will
a banana-rock do?.

86
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,837
Good one, Phoebe! The extra weight of the rock
is making the banana sink!

87
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,718
Yo, monster! Lunch time!

88
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,028
That's it!

89
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,109
The monster?.

90
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:29,950
Where?.

91
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,109
What's it look like?.

92
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,034
No, not the monster - EXTRA WElGHT!

93
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,680
That's how we're going to get to the bottom of
this!

94
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,709
How many more of these do we have to fill?.

95
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,392
Enough to sink the bus!

96
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,916
Hey, Wanda! We've almost got enough extra
Weight!

97
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,275
Uh, this one should do it!

98
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,713
Look out! Here we come!

99
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,715
HURRY!

100
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,119
Come on Liz.

101
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,997
All aboard for the last bus going down!

102
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,032
Dive! Dive!

103
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,119
Sinking... sinking...sunk!

104
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:31,195
Something about this field trip seems fishy to
me...HA! HA!

105
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,349
CAR-LOS!!!

106
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,953
You were right, Phoebe,

107
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,032
nothing like adding a little extra weight to make
something sink.

108
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,795
You think underwater monsters like peanut butter
and jelly?.

109
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,997
I don't know, but if you feed it - I'll film it!

110
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,152
Are we going to keep sinking until we hit bottom?.

111
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,915
Sinking only ends when you hit bottom, Arnold!
HARD LEFT!

112
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,234
Looks like I've got some competition!

113
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,513
Well... not for long!

114
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,514
What is that?.!

115
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,471
We're losing our weights!

116
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,997
Oh, no! We're rising to the surface!

117
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,676
Right you are, Phoebe! Can you feel the water
pushing us up up up up?.

118
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,433
Oh, isn't floating to the surface exciting?.

119
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,230
No! SlNKlNG is exciting! I DON'T WANT TO
FLOAT!

120
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,479
No one's going to ruin my story - especially a
bunch of nosey kids!

121
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:58,193
OH NO! Oh, boy! We're floating again!

122
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,034
Ah! Isn't it delightful?. Water can be such pushy
stuff

123
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,078
Push water out of the way and it pushes back.

124
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,234
It's the water's push that's making us float.

125
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,075
But we've got to find that monster, Ms Frizzle!
We're sunk if we can't sink!

126
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,276
As my Uncle Verne always said,

127
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,718
"Arrr! There's more than one way to sink a floater!
"Coming Liz?.

128
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,988
What're we goanna do?. What're we goanna do?.

129
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,834
Maybe if I put enough heavy rocks in here and
seal it up tight.

130
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,310
My monster cam will sink! Say cheese, down
there!

131
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,429
It works!

132
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,715
Now how am I going to feed the monster?.

133
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,314
Send him your sandwich USS.

134
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,594
USS?.

135
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,993
United Sinking Service! Heh-heh-Uh-huh, just
pitch it out there.

136
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:04,753
Hey! My bread's not sinking, it's floating!

137
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,991
Check it out! Phoebe! There's your bread!

138
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,628
Now I'll NEVER get to feed the monster! Oh!

139
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:17,033
The poor thing will starve! Oh well...

140
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,230
Hey, Phoebe, don't look now, but your bread ball
just sank!

141
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,914
I don't get it. If they both weigh the same -

142
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,629
why does a bread slice float and a bread ball
sink?.

143
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,676
Did someone say ¡®sink'???.

144
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,558
Over here, Wanda. Instant replay!

145
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,036
There, see it?.!Your bread ball is sinking!

146
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:42,557
So, what's the difference between a bread slice
and a bread ball?.

147
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:47,994
Okay, I give up. What's the difference between a
bread slice and a bread ball?.

148
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,991
It's not a joke, Ralphie!

149
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:55,200
The only difference I can see is that the ball is a
lot smaller than the slice.

150
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,317
Ooh, a BlG point, Keesha! They weigh the same
-

151
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,870
but the big one floats, and the small one sinks!

152
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,315
Does that mean you can take something that
floats...

153
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,472
and crumple it down smaller - and it'll sink?.

154
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:12,031
Now you're thinking, Wanda! Make it small
enough and even a cork will sink!

155
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,511
I get it!If we crumple the bus small enough, it'll
sink, right?.!

156
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,991
Now you're thinking SlNKlNG! Class, prepare to
crumple!

157
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,714
All right! Let's crumple this floater into a sinker!

158
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,349
It'll be a tight squeeze - but not to worry - we're all
friends!

159
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,638
Liz, activate the Crumple Zones!

160
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,156
But I STlLL don't get it! We weigh the same,

161
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,993
so how does being smaller make us sink?.

162
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,432
Maybe it's because the more we crumple in...

163
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,079
the less water we shove out of the way!

164
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,879
NOW I get it! The less water we shove out of the
way -

165
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,394
the less the water pushes back on us!

166
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:10,115
Yes! And down we go! A sinking we will go, a
sinking we will go.

167
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,320
Don't these children ever give up?.

168
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,435
Don't these children ever give up?.

169
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,232
Cut it out, Phoebe!

170
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,676
It's crumpled enough in here without you
squirming around like an eel!

171
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,991
I'm just getting ready to feed the monster when
we find it.

172
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,196
When I find it, you mean!

173
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,550
We bottomed out, Ms Frizzle!

174
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,108
We're as low as we can go!

175
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,911
WAN-DAAAA! Where're you going?.

176
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,914
Wait a sec! We're going up!

177
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,437
What happened?. Why didn't we stay sunk?.

178
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,829
We were okay until Wanda left.

179
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,595
Of course!When Wanda left, it made us lighter!

180
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,035
Wanda! Come back!

181
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,633
WAAAAAAN-DA!

182
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,836
LOOK! The monster's got Wanda!

183
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,150
We have to get back down there!

184
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,674
How?. The water's shoving us up again!

185
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,513
I've got it! Let's get smaller!

186
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,878
Oh, I'm afraid we can't do that, Ralphie! The
Crumple Control's jammed!

187
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,748
We need something heavy to weight us down -
but what?.

188
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,909
I know!

189
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,513
CARLOS!

190
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,719
What's he doing?.

191
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,678
He's letting water into the pontoons!

192
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,633
The pontoons are filling up with water!!

193
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,913
Now one side's heavier than the other!

194
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:51,598
I see what he's doing! Water's heavy, right?. More
water - more weight!

195
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,511
And down we go!

196
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,875
GOOD ONE, CARLOS!

197
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,795
Hang in there, Wanda, we're coming down!

198
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,830
If that little girl finds my monster, why... I'm sunk!

199
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,350
HELLLLLLLP!

200
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,993
Let go of me! Get away!

201
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,238
Oh, all right, you asked for it!

202
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,511
What?. It's nose just floated away!

203
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,789
My mother was right!

204
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,998
Ooh! There is NO monster! It's all just pretend!!

205
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,516
And I get to reveal it all on ¡® In Your Face'!

206
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,989
You mean, YOU did this?.

207
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,752
Well, I had no choice, did l?.!

208
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,990
I mean, when your ratings are sinking like mine
are -

209
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,595
you need a boffo-socko expose' to make ¡®em rise
up again.

210
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,511
But this is dishonest!

211
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,993
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I, I prefer to use the
phrase ¡®creative journalism.

212
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,833
Call it what you want - you won't get away with it!

213
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,037
Nobody's going to believe you - why, you're just a
little kid!

214
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,031
We'll see about that!

215
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,871
If nothing else, she's a feisty little kid!

216
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,114
Where's Wanda?.

217
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,792
And where's the monster?.

218
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,757
What if the monster ate her?.!

219
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,831
But I wanted to feed it!

220
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,909
PHOE-BE!

221
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,072
Just kidding. Wanda!

222
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,192
Here she comes!

223
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,472
Are you okay?.!

224
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,120
Did you find the evidence you were looking for,
Wanda?.

225
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,111
What happened to the monster?.

226
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,516
The monster is a fake!

227
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,828
What?.

228
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,990
The real monster is Gerri Poveri.

229
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,197
She set the whole thing up just to get people to
watch her show.

230
00:15:55,280 --> 00:16:00,229
We have to get back to the surface and stop
her!The truth must be told!

231
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,029
The truth is the pontoons are completely filled
with water.

232
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,430
Which means we're sunk -- for good!

233
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,592
Hold it! We know how to sink a floater, right?.

234
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,035
So there must be a way to float a sinker!

235
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,908
Easy! Remember how we got lighter when
Wanda left?.

236
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,514
Oh, no! Do I have to go out there again?.!

237
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,434
Push on, Arnold, I think you're wading into
something.

238
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:28,071
Well, I was thinking that if the water in the
pontoons weighs us down.

239
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,914
what if we push the water out with something
lighter?.

240
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,594
And what is a LOT lighter than water?.

241
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,671
AlR!

242
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,672
Pump hoses in place!

243
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,830
Do you think this is going to work, Ms Frizzle?.

244
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,070
Only one way to find out.

245
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,754
Pumpers start your pumps!

246
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:58,679
It's working! The air is pushing the water out!
We're getting lighter!

247
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,557
We've got lift off!

248
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:05,391
Ah, now that we're lighter - the force of the water
pushing up

249
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,074
is greater than our weight pushing down!

250
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,994
And that means we can stop Gerri Poveri from
floating a lie

251
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,470
to the unsuspecting public just to boost her
ratings!

252
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,195
Sink again, little girl!

253
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,633
What happened?.!

254
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,039
We stopped going up!

255
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,554
Oh, no! We're going down again!

256
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,234
The corks are gone and the air is escaping!

257
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:42,429
As my old Uncle Windchill used to say,Air today,
gone tomorrow!"

258
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,351
Look! It's Gerri Poveri!

259
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,792
What do we do?.!What do we do?.! What do we
do!?.

260
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:59,590
The inflatable genius of Gerri Poveri is about to
rise to the surface!

261
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,753
It's showtime!

262
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:15,675
This is Gerri Poveri, reporting live from Walker
Lake...

263
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,831
It's no use. What's sunk is sunk.

264
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,832
Look!It's Gerri Poveri's fake monster!

265
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,990
It's rising to the surface!

266
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,469
There must be something we can do!

267
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,959
We have to get lighter!

268
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,112
Wait a second! What about getting bigger?.

269
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,440
Remember my bread slice?.!

270
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:36,952
Remember my bread slice?.!

271
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:41,716
Crumpled and small it sank... but when it was big,
it floated!

272
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,110
So if we uncrumple the bus, we'll get bigger,

273
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,351
push more water out of the way and float to the
surface!

274
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,152
Good idea, DA!

275
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,710
Ms Frizzle - maybe you can uncrumple from the
inside!

276
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:59,796
You got it, Wanda! Come on, Liz! Use those
uncrumpling muscles!

277
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:18,077
It's working! The bigger the bus gets, the more
the water is pushing on it.

278
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,039
No kidding! We're turning this sinker into a super
floater!

279
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,032
Bring the monster-cam, Tim! I've got an idea!

280
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,552
We'll be right back!

281
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,518
Going UP!

282
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,993
Underneath a deceptively calm surface

283
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,231
the residents of Walkerville are gripped with fear.

284
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,959
But the recent sightings of the so-called monster

285
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,396
have caused this reporter to be more than a little
skeptical.

286
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,950
Hey, hey, what's going on?. HEY!

287
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,360
OH!! M-M-M-MY CAMERA!

288
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:04,038
OH, MY CHOPPER! OH, OH, OH! MY STORY!

289
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,749
OUR story, you mean! Ready Tim?.

290
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,989
Ready!

291
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,951
So that's all that remains of the monster of
Walker Lake.

292
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:25,158
I know we ruined your story, but the truth had to
be told.

293
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:29,916
Well, I have to hand it to you, you're certainly a
brave bunch of kids.

294
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,560
And your camera work is excellent, Tim.

295
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,756
Thanks, Gerri. Hi, mom!

296
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:38,753
We may have been brave, but you were wrong to
perpetrate this hoax.

297
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,751
You owe your public an apology.

298
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:45,755
Yes, yes, right you are, Wanda. To these kids
here

299
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,197
and to all my viewers out there I'm so sorry.

300
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:58,270
So let's look once again at the shot which got you
a spot on this show and me

301
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:02,319
an offer to star in a new underwater
action-adventure series.

302
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,958
How did you do it?.

303
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,477
We knew that monster was big enough and light
enough to float.

304
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,516
So, all we had to do was let it loose.

305
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,036
And you know the rest.

306
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:18,076
Your very own monster ended up lN YOUR
FACE!

307
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,514
Yes, well...did...did't.

308
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,195
Well You must be very proud of your class, Ms
Frizzle.

309
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:37,355
Well, Gerri, as you yourself once said, the
truth...always floats to the surface!

310
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,679
Is it the magic school bus?.

311
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,795
Is it the magic school bus?.

312
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,790
The magic school bus?.

313
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,029
Is it the magic school bus?.

314
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,075
Is it the magic school bus?.

315
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,116
The magic school bus?.

316
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,877
The magic school bus?.

317
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:15,918
Well, nothing like a good hoax to get you your
own series! I love show business.

318
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,195
Uh! Should I let it ring?.

319
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,669
No, no - could be my agent.

320
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,638
Hello?.

321
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,314
I just saw your show where the bus floated and
sank

322
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,233
by pushing water in and out of those big tank
things.

323
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,595
Well, that's ridiculous.

324
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,874
Why?.

325
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,476
I don't know about any bus,

326
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:11,109
but that's how submarines switch from floating to
sinking and back again.

327
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:14,869
By pushing water in and out of big tanks inside
the hull.

328
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,919
They do?.

329
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,036
They do, and goodbye!

330
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,590
Now, do I have everything?.

331
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,589
Oh, I don't believe this! Hello! Whatever it is you
want, make it quick.

332
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,513
I bet you I could make a solid copper penny float.

333
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,388
Ah-ha, no way! That would be so heavy it'd sink,
no matter what.

334
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,994
Uh-uh! All you've got to do is

335
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,878
get it to push more water out of the way to hold
its weight.

336
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,713
So smash it thin and flat with a hammer.

337
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:48,358
And then bend up the edges to make a copper
boat. Then, it'll float.

338
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:56,229
Gee! Thanks for the tip! And thank you for the tip,
Liz. Bye-bye!
