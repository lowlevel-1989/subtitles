1
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,758
O.K... Hold this steady!.

2
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,276
HEY D.A.! Get yet nose out of that book!

3
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,237
We need help with this thing.

4
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,878
Just a sec...

5
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,873
we've got to follow the instructions or the whole
thing is going to fall apart!

6
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,799
Good morning, class!

7
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,711
Ms Frizzle!

8
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,473
WOW! A humandoidus-eruptus!

9
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,913
Oh, man.

10
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,434
Carlos, according to my research

11
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,080
it looks to me as if you need one more piece.

12
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,596
If you didn't spend so much time reading and
researching,

13
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,511
you might actually do something!

14
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,989
And if you'd spent more time researching,

15
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,435
you would've known how to put this globe
together!

16
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,834
Gotcha!

17
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,675
I'm afraid you can't put that globe together until
you have ALL the pieces!

18
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,718
SO! There lS a piece missing!

19
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,835
I knew that!

20
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,911
Of course there's a piece missing!

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,551
An island so new it hasn't even been discovered
yet!

22
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,995
How can there be a new island?.

23
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,957
Everything's already here.

24
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,270
Yeah! The earth never changes...

25
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,839
Does it?.

26
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,276
Actually, the earth is changing all the time

27
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,115
right under your very own feet!

28
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,758
It is?.

29
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,917
Bet I can find the new island in one of my books.

30
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,439
What's its name?.

31
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,557
How can it have a name if it hasn't been
discovered yet?.

32
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,915
YEEAAH! and besides D.A.,

33
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,349
By the time you find a clue in all these books

34
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,796
we could discover this mystery island and name it
ourselves!

35
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,758
What a positively explosive proposition, Carlos!

36
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,434
Let's shake a leg - if you get my drift!

37
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,149
Ummm...you're not suggesting another field trip,
are you, Ms Frizzle???.

38
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,310
UMPH! Whoa! To the BUS!!!

39
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,198
This is your captain speaking.

40
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,077
On behalf of my flight crew...

41
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,232
I want to welcome you aboard "Magic School
Bus" Airways.

42
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,711
BUS,... DO YOUR STUFF!

43
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,471
Here we GO!!!

44
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,871
Class, at our present speed, the new island
should be arriving...!

45
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,916
...a lot sooner than I thought.

46
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,594
The lSLAND should be arriving?????.

47
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,519
In accordance with Federal regulations, let me
remind you--

48
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,875
...that this is a non-nail-biting flight.

49
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,990
When we find the island, what should we name
it?.

50
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,958
Let's see...

51
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,389
I now declare this island -

52
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:16,156
which I alone have discovered, to be...Carlos
lsland!

53
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:20,153
Forget it! That's a silly name for an island!

54
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,676
What would YOU call it?. "According To My
Research" lsland?.

55
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,437
No... that's too clunky. Wait a minute!

56
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,590
... I've got a book of names in here.

57
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,513
You can't even think of a name without looking it
up!

58
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,477
Let's see, we could call it

59
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,391
Paradise lsland.

60
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,835
No... too predictable.

61
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,751
Then there's always...

62
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,432
Gilligan's lsland

63
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,715
No... That's already taken.

64
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,670
Looks like our game's gonna get rained out, Ms
Frizzle.

65
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,799
Oh, don't head for the dugout yet, Ralphie.
Those aren't rain clouds,

66
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,075
they're puffs of smoke and ash.

67
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,596
Which means... We are exactly where we need
to be.

68
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,830
Gee, look at that stuff.

69
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,550
It smells, too.

70
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,473
Don't look at me!

71
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,198
The windows are covered with ashes!!!

72
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,750
Put your seats in an upright position, class, and
prepare for landing.

73
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,150
We can't land now! We can't see where we're
going!

74
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,198
Don't worry, Arnold, we won't be landing for
another few minutes.

75
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,558
Whoops, ho, ho, make that a few seconds.

76
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,837
Not to worry class...

77
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,796
HANG TEN, BUS!!

78
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,677
Like wowwww!

79
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,034
TUBULAR.

80
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,072
We could call it Empirical lsland!

81
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,673
Hmmm... not bad.

82
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,517
All ashore that's going ashore!

83
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,235
I don't see any shore, Ms Frizzle.

84
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,593
That's because we're a tad early, Tim.

85
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,868
As I always say get out there AND EXPLORE!

86
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,073
How does she DO that?.!

87
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,991
Not easily I expect.

88
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,437
Well, in the famous words of Ms Frizzle:. the early
bird gets the island.

89
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,753
Watch it!

90
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,154
WAlT! Oh no! MY BOOKS!

91
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,438
I've got'cha!

92
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,671
COME ON YOU WEASLY WlMPS... PULL!!

93
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:22,712
We have to go down there, Ms Frizzle. I need
my books to find that island!

94
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,075
Wouldn't it be easier to go to a bookstore?.

95
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,914
Please, Ms Frizzle?. I'm nothing without my
books!

96
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,309
ME-BOOKS! BOOKS-ME!

97
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,868
...CLASS! Prepare to dive!

98
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,033
Coming, Carlos?.

99
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,511
Not me, Ms Frizzle. I'd rather find that island
than D.A.'s books.

100
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,919
Suit yourself, Carlos.

101
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,998
Anchors away, mates!

102
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,036
Um, if you don't mind, Ms Frizzle,

103
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,874
I'd rather keep as much water between me and
the bottom of the ocean as possible.

104
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,712
A lofty idea, Arnold.

105
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,758
Perhaps you could help Carlos person the
life-raft.

106
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,909
If you insist!

107
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,391
And while you two are personing put these on!

108
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,198
Yes Liz?.

109
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,351
Good idea, Liz.

110
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,910
As a Certified Teaching Lizard, you're more than
capable of handling the mission.

111
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,830
Carry on.

112
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,557
Do your stuff, BUS!

113
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,676
BATTEN DOWN THE HATCHES!

114
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,313
Don't be too long.

115
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:42,072
Come on, Arnold, lets find that island before D.A.
comes back!

116
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,355
Don't you think we should wait here?.

117
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,874
He who hesitates is lost!

118
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,910
Lost. That's the word that bothers me.

119
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,396
C'mon Arnold... Relax, willya?.

120
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,194
I had no idea there were mountains under the
ocean!

121
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:10,717
If I had my books I could tell you all about
underwater mountains.

122
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,872
Who needs books when you have the real thing?.

123
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,997
My bag! Ms Frizzle! Step on it!

124
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,709
You got it, D.A.! GOlNG DOWN.

125
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,835
Is this the ocean floor?.

126
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,351
Bottoms up, everybody!

127
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:53,748
Now where'd that bookbag get to... There it goes!

128
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,719
I'll get it!

129
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,480
HUH?. On second thought...

130
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,189
Move aside, Ralphie... I've gotta get my bag.

131
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,276
Ah, here it is.

132
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,239
OH NO!

133
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,596
HOLY, JUMPlN'!!!...

134
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,636
IT'S GOT MY BAG!!

135
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,630
OCT...OCTO.. OCTOPPPP.... OCTOPUS!

136
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,676
Close but no ink, Ralphie

137
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,637
it's a squid, not an octopus.

138
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,633
A squid has ten tentacles -an octopus only has
eight.

139
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,154
Then how come they don't call them "octacles"?.

140
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,593
Good one, Ralphie!

141
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,758
I don't care how many tentacles it's got,

142
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,877
it's got my books! Come back here!

143
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,198
WHAT'S HAPPENlNG?.

144
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,717
IT'S AN EARTH-QUAAAAKE!!!

145
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,318
We're in trouble!

146
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,713
GOT lT! OH, MY....

147
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:29,434
Oh no! My source of knowledge is GONE!

148
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,312
I tell'ya, something's going on down there.

149
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:40,793
Maybe, but it can't be an island 'cause an island
isn't underwater...is it?.

150
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,952
Ar-nold!!!

151
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,991
IT WASN'T ME!

152
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,876
Liiiiiiiz...?.!

153
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,196
It's coming from those bubbles!

154
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,191
And there's D.A.'s BOOKBAG!

155
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,999
Great! See if there's a map back to school in it.

156
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,390
Get real, Arnold! We have a chance to make
history!

157
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,589
Maybe there's something in here that can tell us
what's going on.

158
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,311
The bag fell this way. I SAW it! I'm sure I did!

159
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,916
Cheer up, Dorothy Ann, there's more than one
way to discover an island.

160
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,554
I'm getting c-c-c-cold.

161
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,598
The deeper the water - the colder it gets, Wanda.

162
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:26,277
Even the bus is cold.

163
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:31,229
If the water's so cold, how come these
funny-looking smokestacks are so hot?.

164
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,958
Good show, Phoe-be!

165
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,511
Something must be heating these things from
underneath.

166
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,592
Is that revelation according to your research?.

167
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:51,708
How could it be according to my research?. I
don't have my research!!

168
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:56,191
Bingo! But- if you keep asking questions you'll
keep getting answers!

169
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,557
Hey D.A... Maybe your books sank down there!

170
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:06,555
I sure hope not. That looks like a canyon in the
bottom of the ocean.

171
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,834
In the immortal words of our very own Ralphie...

172
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,990
...you can't hit a home run unless you swing the
bat. Back to the bus, team!

173
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,437
I wonder if Carlos found the island yet?.

174
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:27,433
Haaa! Before us???.! Not on your pigtails, D.A.!

175
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,154
"As the sea billowed around them,

176
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,676
it seemed as if the entire earth was going to
explode.

177
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,799
Lars could feel the ocean floor trembling beneath
them

178
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,633
he could almost smell the crust melting...

179
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,995
What are you reading - a cookbook?.

180
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,719
Listen to this! It says right here,

181
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,429
the earth's surface is made up of layered,
crust-like plates of rock.

182
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,190
These plates normally move incredibly slowly,

183
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,317
but sometimes one plate jams under another one.

184
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:02,351
When the plate slips, we can actually feel the
earth move!

185
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,910
Carlos, you're starting to sound like Dorothy Ann!

186
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,956
I like to think of the world as a toasted bowling
ball with a crust...

187
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,352
...and we're right here on the edge of two pieces
of crust like these.

188
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,830
And sometimes one piece gets shoved under the
other... Oops!

189
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,229
You created an earthquake!

190
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:28,395
Does that mean we're actually going down
BETWEEN those two pieces of crust???.!

191
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,268
We have to! That's where my books must be!

192
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:36,035
But there's no space between them. How can we
get through?.

193
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,396
Show, Bus! IT'S ACTlON Tl ME!

194
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,671
This is terrific!

195
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,035
Speak for yourself, D.A.!

196
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,236
Hang on, everybody!

197
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,311
I'm being squished!

198
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,197
It's getting hot in here!

199
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,919
These rocks around us are melting.

200
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,429
You bet they are, class!

201
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,752
WE'RE MEL-TlllllNG...!

202
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,237
It's so hot the earth's crust is melting!

203
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,709
It's supposed to melt, Keesha.

204
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,794
I mean, my goodness, the deeper you go into the
earth Phew! the hotter it gets.

205
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,229
Anyone know what melted rock is called?.

206
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,039
Rock juice?.

207
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,599
Magma.

208
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,076
It must be 2OOO degrees out there!

209
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,675
So there's melted rock deep under the ocean?.
...what's it all mean?.

210
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,319
I think I know!

211
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,160
Heat under the ocean floor

212
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,390
plunging plates of crust...

213
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,398
... melted rock under a mountain...

214
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,517
WE'RE lN AN UNDERWATER VOLCANO!

215
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,272
A VOLCANO?????.!

216
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,839
UNDERWATER???.!

217
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,115
Boingo, Dorothy Ann!

218
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,953
And you figured it out from your own
observations!

219
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,832
Welcome to the Magma Chamber

220
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,275
the heart of a volcano!

221
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,232
How do we get out of here?.!!

222
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,198
Out of a volcano?. How do you suppose?.!

223
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,148
And then a giant fountain of steam shot out of the
water...

224
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,271
...followed by an explosion of--

225
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,148
STOP! I can't take it anymore! You HAVE turned
into Dorothy Ann!

226
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,356
But Arnold... it's all here in this book.

227
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,238
Smelly gasses fountains of steam...

228
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,117
explosions of lava.

229
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,714
Arnold, don't you understand?.

230
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,237
According to my research, we're floating on top of
an undersea volcano!

231
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,920
I KNEW I SHOULD'VE STAYED HOME TODAY!

232
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,308
THE MAGMA'S RlSlNG!

233
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,834
We're gonna get blown sky high!

234
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:04,510
Wait a minute, wait a minute-- WAlT-A- MlNUTE!

235
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,272
Do we have that long?.

236
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,591
When all this molten rock shoots up out of the
volcano

237
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,353
and hits the air, it'll cool, right?.

238
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,351
Oh, absolutely.

239
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:19,309
And when it cools - it'll harden into rock, right?.
NEW rock!!

240
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,628
Eventually!

241
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,910
So, all that new rock will build up on top of this
underwater volcano

242
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,070
... until it sticks up out of the water

243
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,596
enough to make A BRAND NEW lSLAND!!!

244
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,554
YESSSSS...!

245
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,713
Oh, no! We've stopped rising!

246
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,837
Something must be plugging up the volcano!

247
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,388
And the magma's squeezing us!

248
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,755
All we have to do to get out is give that rock up
there a push!

249
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,831
We don't HAVE to do anything!

250
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,353
Yes we do, Ralphie!

251
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,317
It's time to take chances,

252
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,470
make mistakes get melted!!!

253
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,638
Into your anti-magma gear, everyone!

254
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,028
According to this book, a lot of stuff gets blown
out of a volcano when it erupts.

255
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,430
Like volcanic ash. Volcanic ash?.!

256
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,914
Pumice and rocks! Pumice and rocks???.!!

257
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,032
And LAVA! LAVA???.!?.

258
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,430
Put them all together and you-- GET ME
OUTTA HERE!

259
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:30,838
No, Arnold, you get...CARLOS lSLAND!

260
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,430
PUSH!!! This is the chance of a lifetime!

261
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,192
The END of a lifetime, you mean!

262
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,832
Push, Ralphie! Don't let the pressure get to you!

263
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,028
MY HELMET lS CRACKlNG. HURRY!

264
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,677
We can't budge it, Ms Frizzle! WE NEED HELP!!

265
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:59,070
Come on, Bus!...do your STUFF!!!

266
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,318
It's working!

267
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,230
Play it again, Bus...YEAH!

268
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,151
It's ready to blow!

269
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,439
WA.... HOOOOOOOO!!!

270
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,720
Carlos lsland is about to be BORN!

271
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,990
...Too bad D.A.'s gonna miss it!

272
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,310
I'd give ANYTHlNG to miss it!

273
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,477
Is it over yet?.

274
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,909
It's just beginning, Arnold!

275
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,797
I CAN'T BELlEVE lT!

276
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,270
...the volcano is making new rock! It's actually
making a new island!

277
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,316
D.A.'s really missing something!

278
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,232
DOROTHY ANN?.! Where'd you come from?????.

279
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:08,153
D.A.! You just missed the coolest eruption you
ever saw!

280
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,754
I didn't miss it! I was part of it!

281
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,071
Where's everybody else?.

282
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,470
Wow! What a ride!

283
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,150
I like being erupted!

284
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,470
But where's Ms Frizzle?.

285
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,713
Hi-ho, everyone! WA-HOOOOO...!

286
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,995
Nice landing, Ms Frizzle!

287
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,957
To Carlos lsland!

288
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,193
Carlos lsland?????.

289
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,794
You mean D.A. Island!

290
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,031
I discovered it -even WlTHOUT my books.

291
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,680
But neither one of you LANDED there first!
LOOK!

292
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,474
Liz?.

293
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,918
Here's your bookbag, D.A.. I never thought l'd
say this,

294
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,235
but I was really glad to have it.

295
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,074
And I was really glad I DlDN'T have it for a
change.

296
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,356
What an experience!

297
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,715
I think we should write a book about it.

298
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:19,749
"DlSCOVERlNG LlZARD lSLAND' by D.A. and
Carlos.

299
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,910
You mean by Carlos and D.A..

300
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,309
No, D.A. and Carlos.

301
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,678
Carlos and D.A. D.A. AND CARLOS!!!

302
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,872
As I always say, unlike the earth -

303
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,793
some things never change.

304
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,238
Carlos and D.A.

305
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,788
D.A.!!! CARLOS!!!

306
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,912
Is it the magic school bus?.

307
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,319
Is it the magic school bus?.

308
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,355
The magic school bus?.

309
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,395
Is it the magic school bus?.

310
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,390
Is it the magic school bus?.

311
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,469
The magic school bus?.

312
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,835
The magic school bus?.

313
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:13,394
So, Liz, how does it feel to have your own island
out here

314
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,754
in the middle of nowhere?.

315
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,834
I don't believe this. I'm supposed to be on
vocation.

316
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,509
Hello. Magic School Bus... Producer speaking...

317
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,398
Hello. I just saw your show on volcanoes,

318
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,517
and I've got to tell you, it was unbelievable.

319
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,158
I know, I know.

320
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:36,113
It takes a lot longer than a few minutes for a
volcano...

321
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,317
...to grow from an undersea mountain to an
island.

322
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:45,748
And it probably took thousands of years for that
mountain to get as big as it was.

323
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,913
Exactly. But hey, we've only got a half an hour to
tell the story.

324
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,228
I gotcha.

325
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,199
And I totally bought the connection

326
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:58,478
between the erupting volcano and the making of
an island.

327
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,758
Great! Then you know that a volcano in the sea
is just like a volcano on land.

328
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,908
No, but I do now.

329
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:09,316
There's no fire in a volcano, only heat,

330
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,278
so the water can't put it out, right?.

331
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,349
You got it.

332
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,070
But not all volcanoes form where a plate gets
pushed down into the crust.

333
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,036
They don't?.

334
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,996
Some volcanoes form where plates pull apart -

335
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,511
and others are just over hot spots in the crust.

336
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,635
Okay,

337
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,396
so maybe you didn't believe the part where the
kids got so close to the volcano.

338
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,836
Oh, come on - it's television!

339
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:40,196
We all know real kids don't go inside volcanoes

340
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:43,113
or hang around on rafts when they're erupting.

341
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,315
NO WAY!

342
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,598
I guess not.

343
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,074
So what is it you found so unbelievable?.

344
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:56,996
That Liz just so happened to have a flag on her
when she landed on the new island!

345
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,635
That is pretty unbelievable... but don't forget...

346
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,314
Liz isn't your ordinary lizard.
