1
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,558
Sorry, Carlos!

2
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,077
Hey, Feeb! What's the rush!

3
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,357
It's my weekend to bring Liz home! I have to get
her ready!

4
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,838
OH MY!

5
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,553
What's wrong?

6
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,312
Liz is missing!

7
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,358
MlSSlNG? But she was here yesterday!

8
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,396
She's here every day!

9
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,710
Maybe she moved into another classroom.

10
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,988
No way, Ralphie! Liz loves it here! She'd NEVER
leave us!

11
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,677
Then how come her sunglasses are gone!

12
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,273
And her earphones!

13
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,716
Huh. And her entire habitat!

14
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,396
MS FRlZZLE!

15
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,708
Good morning, class!

16
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,519
Ms Frizzle! Liz is missing!

17
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,990
Oh, I know. And so is the air from my alligator.

18
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,595
I don't get it! Ms Frizzle sounds so unconcerned.

19
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,716
Cold-blooded is more like it!

20
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,677
Did somebody say ¡®cold-blooded'?.

21
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,910
That reminds me, Liz is not going to be here t'...

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,797
A note! I found a note!

23
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,199
What's it say?.

24
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,831
I don't know. It's written in lizard. Can you read it,
Ms Frizzle?.

25
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,755
Let's see. "Claw polish, scale moisturizer,
fangpaste..."

26
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,308
That sounds like a packing list!

27
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,277
Then Liz DlD move out!

28
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,639
And I know where! She went to Herp Ha! The
address is right here!

29
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,953
It's not Herp Ha - it's Herp something else! The
rest of the Ha is torn off!

30
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,076
Okay, but what's a Herp?.

31
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,199
Oh, good question, Ralphie! Quite simply, a herp
is a reptile.

32
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,751
And Liz is a lizard which makes her a reptile, so...

33
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:01,118
So that still doesn't tell us why She'd pack up all
of her stuff and leave us!

34
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,555
What if she's in terrible danger?.

35
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:08,839
Oh, if only we knew what it was like to be a lizard
- to feel what Liz feels -

36
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:14,517
to get inside her skin, maybe then, maybe then
we'd know the answer!

37
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,434
I couldn't have said it better myself! To the bus!

38
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,710
Is a rescue mission considered the same as a
field trip?.

39
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,875
"Herp... Haven"

40
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,030
I told you it wasn't Herp Ha!

41
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,429
I don't see anything funny about this place,
anyway.

42
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,715
What kind of place is this?.

43
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,039
YlKES! An alligator crossing!

44
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,680
They're probably there to keep visitors out!

45
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,751
Or keep Liz in!

46
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,998
HEY, LOOK OUT!

47
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,998
Shooooo...that turtle's humongous!

48
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,479
Ah... Mrs. Westlake...how can we serve your
reptilian friend...

49
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,109
I want him toasted and stuffed, just like the last
one.

50
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:17,950
You do have a sense of humor, Mrs. Westlake.
Ta ta.

51
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,712
Toasted and stuffed?.

52
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,031
Sounds like that turtle is about to become
somebody's dinner!

53
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,078
Oh, no! What if Liz is next?.

54
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,188
Liz ala mode, sprinkled with pecans and a light
honey-chestnut glaze!

55
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,670
Ooo, if only we could get inside!

56
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:43,596
I think my great Aunt Penny said it best: "A lost
ball can go a long way."

57
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,429
Yes?.

58
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,672
Hi. I am but an innocent school child

59
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,958
who has innocently lost my innocent baseball
over your fence.

60
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,953
May I innocently come in and innocently get it
back?.

61
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,431
There are certain requirements that must be met
before entry is allowed.

62
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,511
Requirements?.

63
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,628
Yes. "Body temperature : changeable. Sweat
glands: none.

64
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,033
Scales or skin: allowed. Hair: not allowed." See
for yourself!

65
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,955
And we definitely do NOT take bats! Thank you.
Good day.

66
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,636
Wait, l--

67
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,956
"Body temperature: changeable".

68
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,874
Well, that let's us out. Our body temperature
stays mostly the same.

69
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,428
That's why we're called WARM-blooded!

70
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,795
Then -- is a reptile called COLD-blooded?.

71
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:42,317
Ah. It is indeed, Tim! ALL reptiles are
cold-blooded.

72
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,029
Cold-blooded, old-blooded. What we need is a
plan!

73
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,839
Okay. Since they won't LET us in -

74
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,957
we need to get inside without them knowing we're
inside!

75
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,508
What we need is... a DlSGUlSE!

76
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,637
I've got it! A Trojan horse!

77
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:03,238
No way, DA. They only take reptiles! And a horse
isn't a reptile!

78
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:08,792
Not a REAL horse, Ralphie! According to my
research, in ancient times,

79
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:14,432
Greek soldiers built a huge wooden horse and hid
inside it to fool their enemy.

80
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:19,389
That's it! We turn the bus into a
Trojan...ALLlGATOR!

81
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,599
You sure this is going to work, Ms Frizzle?.

82
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:29,312
As I always say, ¡®if you can't beat ¡®em, join ¡®em'!
Here we go.

83
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,711
Everyone okay in there?.

84
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,314
Happy as a herp, Feeb! Let's do it!

85
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,154
Man, this is what I call an lNSlDE job!

86
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,195
CAR-LOS!

87
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,431
Remember, keep your eyes open for Liz!

88
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,910
Stand by, we're goin' in!

89
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:04,828
Yes?. Ah, what a splendid alligator. Would you
like to come inside?.

90
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,151
Yes, but I don't want her toasted and stuffed!

91
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:14,839
Whatever you say, my dear. We'll just tease her
and squeeze her.

92
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,271
Does she have a name?.

93
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,993
Valerie!

94
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,232
How enchanting. Come along, Valerie.

95
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,754
Wait here!

96
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,912
But uh...Valerie doesn't like to be alone.

97
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,558
No need to be concerned.

98
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:45,236
We just l-o-o-o-o-v-v-e-e our cold-blooded critters
to death.

99
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,673
What does he mean by that?.

100
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,034
Did you say something?.

101
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,477
Uh... I said I hope she's not, not too fat.

102
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,870
Silly girl, reptiles never get fat!

103
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:02,476
Wait, l... I was hoping to see how you do
whatever it is you do.

104
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,236
Uh. Really, watching can be so tire some. Relax,
read a magazine.

105
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,389
But, uh, but--

106
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,994
We'll let you know when she's done.

107
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,230
When she's done?.

108
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,397
Yes?. Young lady?.

109
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,832
Liz?. LlZ! Where are you?.

110
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,078
We did it! We 're in!

111
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,196
We're in hot water, you mean!

112
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,230
Cold water, actually!

113
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,189
Cold - hot, either way, we're sunk! How do we get
out of here?.

114
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,838
We can't go out there!

115
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,912
Those are real snakes and alligators crawling
around!

116
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,072
They look like they're looking for something.

117
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,230
As long as they're not looking for us.

118
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,471
Hey, that lizard looks just like Liz!

119
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,790
Maybe Liz was homesick.

120
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,190
One thing's for sure, we can't find Liz by staying
in here!

121
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:25,238
I recall my great Aunt Beatrice once said,

122
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,993
¡®you know, one good reptile deserves another'.

123
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,039
Great idea, Ms Frizzle! If we become reptiles...

124
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,759
then that guy at the front door won't bother us!

125
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:39,595
And we can look for Liz and nobody will know the
difference! Go for it!

126
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,150
All right! Gather 'round all you would be reptiles!

127
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,197
Umm... Ms Frizzle,

128
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:52,115
don't you think someone should stay behind and
keep an eye on the busagator?.

129
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,033
Good thinking, Arnold! The job is yours!

130
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,997
I'll stay with you, Arnold.

131
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:01,193
Think of your favorite reptile. Ready?.

132
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,551
Say ahhhhh, bus!

133
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,512
Awesome!

134
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,476
Incredible!

135
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,834
COOL!

136
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,959
Cool is right, Ms Frizzle! I'm chilly, ooh!

137
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,549
Any better?.

138
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,154
Uh uh. I'm still cold.

139
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,789
I don't think hiding in your shell is gonna get the
job done, Ralphie.

140
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,237
Looks like we have to move to a warmer place -
like this turtle did over here!

141
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:39,479
Wait for me! Hey, you're right! The heat
OUTSlDE is making me warmer lNSlDE!

142
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,949
Hm, toasty.

143
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:46,477
That's it! To FEEL the heat - you have to FlND
the heat!

144
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,076
Ah. You're hot today, Tim! To a reptile, location is
everything.

145
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:55,392
Come on, guys, Liz is not here! We've got to find
her!

146
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,793
I'll get the door!

147
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,035
Whoa. Good one, Keesh!

148
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,995
Oh, oh, we're dead meat!

149
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:19,232
According to my research, alligators seldom
attack human beings.

150
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:25,316
Uh. I hate to remind you, DA, but we're human
beings inside a busagator!

151
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,474
LlZ?. LlZ, I KNOW YOU'RE HERE! Food?.

152
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:37,192
Suppertime. I love suppertime. reptiles and
lizards too.

153
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,475
We're gonna give it to you.

154
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:48,514
Ah, fly fricassee with a, umm, light bug sauce,
umm! They'll love it!

155
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,399
MENU?. Please please please let there be no Liz
Delight or Spaghetti and Lizballs.

156
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:06,916
Phew! Nothing. Whoa, the lizards get just one
meal a week and the alligators get only one meal
a month!

157
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,709
How inhumane! What kind of place is this?.

158
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,153
I just don't get it!

159
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,038
Why would Liz want to leave our warm and cozy
classroom

160
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,190
for a weird place like this?.

161
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,794
Got me! Let's look in here.

162
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,833
Hmh! I'm getting good at this.

163
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,836
Whoa, bake city!

164
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,480
Whew! I'm boiling, too!

165
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,949
That's because we're in the boiler room!

166
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,157
So how come I'm not perspiring like I usually do
when I'm hot?.

167
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,355
No sweat, Tim!

168
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,230
Sweat glands - none! That's what it said on that
scroll!

169
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,836
So I bet reptiles CAN'T sweat to cool down even
if they wanted to!

170
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,992
Hold it! If you have to find heat to feel warm -

171
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,117
maybe you have to find cold to cool down.

172
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,114
Only one way to find out!

173
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,512
I can feel my temperature dropping already.

174
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,720
Amazing! One little move turns a hot foot into a
cool mule!

175
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,349
I can't believe us! We're more worried about
staying the right temperature

176
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,034
than we are about finding the one and only Liz!

177
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,838
Come on, we have to get moving!

178
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,798
Aw, just when I was feeling comfy!

179
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,156
Turn on the heat, DA, I'm c-c-cold!

180
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,553
I g-g-guess there's no heater in a busagator
because it's a reptile!

181
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:40,634
Then move the busagator to where it's
w-w-warmer!

182
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:46,715
I c-c-can't do that, either! The b-b-busagator isn't
w-w-working!

183
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,554
It's probably too c-c-cold, that's why!

184
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:54,872
Maybe if we bring heat to the b-b-bus, we can
g-g-get it to m-m-move!

185
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,713
If we're not careful, we could wind up inside a
REAL alligator.

186
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:12,272
Excuse me, l... I'm really sorry. I'll never do it
again I promise!

187
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,831
Over here, Arnold! Help me push this heat lamp
to the busagator.

188
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,271
Don't look now, but we're being followed!

189
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,559
Maybe they're upset because we took their heat.

190
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,673
FORGET THE HEAT! BACK TO THE BUS!

191
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,998
But we need it to get the bus moving!

192
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,753
You're going to need more than heat to get you
moving

193
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,796
if that gator gets any closer!

194
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,319
Come on, come on.

195
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,876
THAT WAS CLOSE!

196
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,952
The Quiet Room.

197
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,550
It's like a fridge in here!

198
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,438
Some of these guys look like they've been here
for months!

199
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,556
And that one on the end looks like...

200
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,232
LlZ!

201
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,513
Liz! Wake up! It's us!

202
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,557
She's barely breathing!

203
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,355
I can't hear her heartbeat!

204
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,158
Liz, snap out of it.

205
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,153
What are we goanna do?. What are we goanna
do?. What are we goanna do?.

206
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,195
Come on, Liz! Wake up!

207
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,670
She's not sleeping - she looks like she's frozen!

208
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:53,357
I don't get it! It feels so cold in here - how come
I'm not shivering?.

209
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,510
Since they don't have sweat glands,

210
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,353
maybe reptiles don't have shiver glands, either.

211
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,479
Come on, Ralphie, there's no such thing as a
shiver gland!

212
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,074
Shivering is just something people do to get
warm.

213
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,957
Right as rain, Wanda!

214
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,396
Since reptiles can't shiver, when they get
REALLY cold,

215
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,870
their bodies just slow way down.

216
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,993
Whoa-oa! I'm slowing...down...too!

217
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,073
Isn't that like hibernation?.

218
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:25,039
Exxxxxx...actly!

219
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,793
When did you guys become reptiles?.

220
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:37,000
Phoebe! Un-hiber-nate Liz! Take her some-place
warm!

221
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:43,838
You poor, tortured creature. So strong, so brave,
so tough in the face of danger.

222
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,391
Feeeeeb! Hibernation isn't dangerous.
It's... restful!

223
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,517
Think of it as a...va...cation.

224
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,591
Look! The heat from my body is warming her up!

225
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:01,630
I'll take her outside! Let's go you guys! There's no
time to lose!

226
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,313
Don't worry, guys, I'll save you...

227
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:14,230
Liz... it's us! How are you doing?.

228
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,276
Say hello to freedom!

229
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:23,314
Pardon me, young lady, where are going with
those reptiles?.

230
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,516
Um... Not this way!

231
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,999
This way!

232
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:43,676
HELLO?. ANYBODY HERE?.

233
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,435
Arnold... DA...get us out of here!

234
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,158
We c-c-can't!

235
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,028
The b-b-bus is so c-c-cold - it stopped
w-w-working!

236
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,079
May be the bus is hibernating...just like Liz was!

237
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,357
Not cold again! I was just warming up!

238
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,671
Oh, no! That means if we don't get the bus
moving...

239
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,752
we could be reptiles for the rest of our lives!

240
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,715
Liz must be feeling better!

241
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:21,197
THOSE reptiles aren't cold - they look really
happy!

242
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,588
Is it just me - or is the perfect place here?.

243
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:31,800
BETTER than perfect! One flick of the tail makes
it's just right!

244
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:37,432
Yeah! Not too hot - and not too cold, and
coziness is only a slither away!

245
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,509
That's it!

246
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,434
All we have to do to get the bus working again is
to move it over here-

247
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,033
where the temperature's warmer!

248
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,078
I can do that! You guys get in the bus!

249
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,154
You'll be fine once we get you home, won't you
Liz.

250
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,233
Here we go!

251
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,190
Come on, Phoebe, pull!

252
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,395
You can do it!

253
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,509
I made it! We're here!

254
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,039
It's working! The bus is coming back to life!

255
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,595
As I always say, what's good for an alligator is
good for a busagator!

256
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,672
Open the door, Phoebe! We're taking ¡®er out!

257
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,913
All clear!

258
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,316
We're outside!

259
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,356
Yay.

260
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,714
Ready to go home, guys?.

261
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,360
Oh, no! Gators!

262
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,039
Do something, Ms Frizzle! They haven't eaten in
a month!

263
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,517
O. K. Everyone think of your favorite person!
Ready?.

264
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,715
HlT lT!

265
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,593
Come on, Feeb, hop aboard!

266
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,072
Okay, bus, do your stuff!

267
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:23,789
WAlT! You forgot something!

268
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,110
Be careful, Ms. Frizzle!

269
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,640
Now, what could it possibly be?.

270
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,676
LlZ'S HABlTAT?.

271
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,433
Liz's habitat.Thanks, Harry.

272
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,353
Ms. Frizzle! You know him?.

273
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,194
That I do! Harry is the one who built Liz's habitat.

274
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,191
It just needed a few repairs.

275
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,792
But you mean, this is a GOOD place to be?.

276
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,759
THE place to be, my dear:Harry Herps' Happy
Herp Haven...

277
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,879
Iuxury spa and restful resort for weary and
worn-out reptiles!

278
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,396
Whoa...so you WEREN'T going to freeze Liz?.

279
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:07,871
Well, we did make her cool and comfy if that's
what you mean.

280
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,155
And you WEREN'T going to stuff her?.

281
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:15,073
Hardly. But we did make sure she had enough to
eat -

282
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:20,029
which isn't difficult, since reptiles often go for
weeks without eating.

283
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:24,113
I guess we're not quite as cold-blooded as you
thought,

284
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,714
although our customers are.

285
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,950
I made arrangements for Liz to stay here for a

286
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,838
well-needed rest while Harry was fixing her
habitat.

287
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,673
I started to tell you, but, well,

288
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,593
I just love it when you find out things for
yourselves.

289
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,671
Ms Frizzle!

290
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,749
Is it the magic school bus?.

291
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,909
Is it the magic school bus?.

292
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,989
The magic school bus?.

293
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,149
Is it the magic school bus?.

294
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,195
Is it the magic school bus?.

295
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,396
The magic school bus?.

296
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:01,191
The magic school bus?.

297
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,913
Now, believe it or not,

298
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,754
mammals and birds are the only animals that
keep warm from within.

299
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,957
Do all reptiles do things like look for shade and
sunlight

300
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,758
to keep themselves at the right temperature?.

301
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,716
They have to!

302
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:05,554
While they CAN tell when their temperature is
getting too hot or too cold -

303
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:09,189
they don't have an automatic heating or cooling
system inside like we do.

304
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,477
I get it!When it gets colder or warmer outside -

305
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:16,553
cold-blooded creatures get colder or warmer
inside!

306
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,428
Spoken like a true herp-lover!

307
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,557
But what happens if they get TOO cold or TOO
hot?.

308
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:27,350
Ah. Good question. Normally, reptiles try to avoid
getting into that situation.

309
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,318
Now, if for some reason it gets too cold around
them

310
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,992
and they can't move to a warmer place -

311
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,116
they might bury themselves under leaves -

312
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,237
or find shelter underground, kind of like
hibernating.

313
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,629
I see.So what about Liz?.

314
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:44,436
First of all, you have to remember that Liz is a
magical lizard.

315
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,874
Second of all,

316
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:50,431
she'll do anything she can to make her life easier
and more comfortable.

317
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,397
So if I know Liz,

318
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,198
she'll do everything possible

319
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,590
to add a warm-blooded life-style to her
cold-blooded life!

320
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,238
And as Ms Frizzle said,

321
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:04,758
nothing makes a herp as happy as when the
temperature's just right!
