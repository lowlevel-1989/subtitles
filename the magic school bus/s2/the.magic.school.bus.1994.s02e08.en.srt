1
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,154
They've sure been under there a long time.

2
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,559
I don't like it.

3
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,119
I'm worried.

4
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,270
And I'm very concerned.

5
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,832
Well, I'm not!

6
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,708
The Friz wouldn't let anything happen to the
Magic School Bus! Ever!

7
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,959
She might not have a choice, Wanda. A VMl is a
very powerful person.

8
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,398
A very powerful person!. I thought a VMl was a
Vehicle Maintenance lnspector.

9
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,754
It is, Ralphie.

10
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,673
But Carlos just called Junket a Very Powerful
Person.

11
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,878
He's BOTH, Ralphie! A VMl and a VPP!

12
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,710
Well, Mr. Junket... a bus for all seasons, don't
you think!.

13
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,152
It's missing a SPRlNG or two -

14
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,151
and it's ready to FALL apart, if that's what you
mean.

15
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,439
Look at this! There's acid all over the paint...the
fenders are dented...

16
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,114
and the roof looks like it got hit by a meteorite!

17
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,153
Ah! I know. Isn't that wonderful!.!

18
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,277
This engine doesn't look any better!

19
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,672
Looks can be so deceiving, can't they!. That
engine runs like a dream.

20
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,034
Well, I don't know how, your sparkplugs are shot!

21
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,917
It's a miracle this bus even starts!

22
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:27,515
To the contrary, Mr. Junket. My bus is reliable,
responsible and dependable.

23
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,512
Well...now it's ex-pendable!

24
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:38,428
And therefore, I'm recommending that your bus
be sent to the junk yard!

25
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,438
Oh, no! Junket wants to junk it!

26
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,512
HE can't do that! Not our bus!

27
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,115
I realize our bus may not look its best right now -

28
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,998
but I assure you there is absolutely nothing
wrong with it.

29
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,039
Why, there's even something magical about it.

30
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,032
Magical!.! Really, Ms Frizzle!

31
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,590
I don't recall anything in the safety manual about
magic.

32
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,117
I have a suggestion. Why don't you take a test
drive with me and the kids!.

33
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,158
Let me prove to you that from engine to exhaust -

34
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,391
my bus is as fit as any bus in the fleet!

35
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,871
Ah! Sorry, I have to get back to the office and
accept my award

36
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,520
for Vehicle Maintenance lnspector of the Year.

37
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,070
I heard all about it. Congratulations.

38
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:31,917
You did!. How nice. Well, I suppose we could
take a short drive.

39
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,560
Class!. Time to take chances,

40
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:41,512
get messy and take Mr. Junket for a ride! To the
bus!

41
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,954
What if the bus doesn't pass the test!.

42
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,678
What if the engine stalls!.

43
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,637
Comfortable, Mr. Junket!.

44
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,032
You must be joking! The seats are saggy and the
springs have sprung!

45
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,914
Just feel the power.

46
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,034
It's almost as if we're flying up this hill, don't you
think!.

47
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,992
I've had smoother rides on a roller coaster!

48
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,719
I don't know how I let you talk me into this.

49
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,229
The junk heap is too good for this bus!

50
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,150
I wish Mr. Junket wouldn't talk about our bus that
way!

51
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,153
Maybe if we told him how much we love it - he'd
change his mind.

52
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,559
I doubt it, Feeb.

53
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,837
Juknket's going to scrap our bus unless we do
something to stop him!

54
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,035
Chill out, you guys. If I know Ms Frizzle - she's
got a plan.

55
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,074
Then again, maybe she doesn't.

56
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,277
"Oh... dear... what can the matter be..."

57
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,794
I knew it! I knew I shouldn't have listened to you!

58
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:04,000
I knew I shouldn't have taken this test drive. Now
I'm going to miss my award!

59
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,880
Here's your cap, Mr. Junket.

60
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,873
Oh! I just can't seem to find the problem. The
engine just stopped working.

61
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,791
However-

62
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,712
That's it! I've had it!

63
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,758
This bus is condemned!

64
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,037
The first phone I see I'm calling a tow truck! This
bus is history!

65
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,513
I'll be back!

66
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,918
Don't you just love it when things like this
happen!.

67
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,833
It adds such spark to the day!

68
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,310
What are we going to do!. He's going to take our
bus away!

69
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,914
Not if we can start it before he gets back!

70
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,313
Hurry Ms Frizzle! Hurry!

71
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:48,159
Nice noise, bus... but is it the right noise!.

72
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,949
Maybe Mr. Junket was right. Maybe our bus lS
busted.

73
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:57,160
No way, Tim! We can't let our bus down. We've
GOT to get it started!

74
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,915
But how can we get it working if we don't even
know how it works!.

75
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,950
I know how it works! Sort of I mean, an engine
makes the bus run, right!.

76
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,912
Well, that's certainly fuel for thought!

77
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,958
But we put gas in before we left.

78
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,157
Yes, but the gas tanks all the way in the back...

79
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,356
and the engine's all the way up here!

80
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,634
I knew that!

81
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:28,033
Then maybe...the gas isn't getting from back
here...

82
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,156
to all the way up here for some reason!

83
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:34,917
If we could just follow the gas to the engine - we
could find out the problem!

84
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,150
How can we possibly do that!.

85
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,116
All set, Keesha!.

86
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,992
HEADS UP!

87
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,390
Why'd I even ask...This is a field trip, isn't it!.

88
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,756
Look at it this way, Arnold. If we don't fix the bus
now -

89
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,479
there may never be another field trip!

90
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,393
Let's go! We've got a bus to save!

91
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,198
HlT lT, LlZ!

92
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,119
Hey, what happened!.

93
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,076
What's going on!.!

94
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,559
Where are we going!??.!!!

95
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,751
I know that smell... its gasoline!

96
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,558
I HATE that smell!

97
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,076
Get used to it, Arnold. We're inside the bus's gas
tank!

98
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,358
Okay. So the question is, how does the gas get
from all the way back here -

99
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,078
to all the way up to the engine!.

100
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,312
That way! The gas is going into some kind of
tunnel or pipe!

101
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,791
As Christopher Columbus said when he set sail
to look for America...

102
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,798
All aboard for PARTS unknown!

103
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,835
Stroke! Stroke! Stroke!

104
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,197
Faster! Faster!

105
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,270
The sooner that bus is out of my life the better!

106
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,992
Friz to Liz... Friz to Liz...Come in please...

107
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,710
We're moving out of the fuel tank, Liz, and into
the fuel line.

108
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,588
Stand by! Ready! Set! Duck!

109
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,671
It's a tight squeeze in here.

110
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,070
I guess gas doesn't need a lot of room to get to
the engine.

111
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:41,755
Look up ahead! The gas seems to be trying to
get through...

112
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,070
but it's blocked by something!

113
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:51,634
Is it just me, or is that peanut butter I smell!. It lS
peanut butter!

114
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,759
Maybe this is what's stopping the gas from
getting through to the engine.

115
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:03,110
And without gas - the engine won't run! That's it!
Make way for the gas!

116
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,357
But what's peanut butter doing inside the fuel
line!.

117
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,399
Good question!

118
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,919
JUNKET!

119
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,395
We're almost there! Step on it! I'm getting an
award today, did I tell you!.

120
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,879
Twice!

121
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,550
Line's clear, Ms Frizzle!

122
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,835
The gas is flowing again!

123
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,230
Then the engine should start, right, Ms Frizzle!.

124
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:34,838
We'll soon find out! Seats, everyone! TURN THE
KEY, LlZ!

125
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,558
Where are we!.

126
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,791
Are we inside the engine, Ms Frizzle!.

127
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,237
Technically, no. We've just been pumped into the
carburetor...

128
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,552
ah my favorite place! Keep pumping Liz!

129
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,469
I don't get it! We got the gas flowing - how come
the engine won't start!.

130
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,836
Maybe it needs more than just gas.

131
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,197
Maybe it's too chilly in here for the gas to work.

132
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,999
I feel a draft, too.

133
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,594
It's coming from that opening, up there.

134
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,079
Right you are, Tim!

135
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,711
Air! Of course! Don't you remember what we
learned in Fire Safety!.

136
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,510
You need air for things to burn - and since a
running engine burns gas -

137
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,229
the engine needs gas AND air to run!

138
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,595
Well, we're not getting THAT much air.

139
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,274
That's because something's covering the
opening.

140
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,634
A peanut butter sandwich!.

141
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,232
JUNKET!

142
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,758
YOU ever win an award!.

143
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,752
Let's just get that bus, okay!.

144
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,239
Yeah. Sure.

145
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,399
How come I have to be on the bottom!.!

146
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,711
The class-stack up was MY idea!

147
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:27,830
It's really stuck! Wait... I think I'm getting it!
Almost...GOT lT!

148
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,436
LOOK OUT!

149
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,912
WHAT lS THAT! OH, NO! A TOW TRUCK!

150
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:43,472
There's a tow truck out here! They're going to tow
us away!

151
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,357
Hold on, Arnold!

152
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,718
Now that we have gas and air, maybe the engine
will work!

153
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,598
Start it up, Liz!

154
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:57,789
LlZ! Oh! Come on, Liz, don't quit on us now!

155
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:05,992
Champions thrive on adversity! TURN THE KEY,
LlZ!

156
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,909
Hold it! Is that awful hunk of junk trying to start!.

157
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,070
I thought everyone had gone for help.

158
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,995
There's lots of air now!

159
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,879
Okay, so here's where the gas and air mix
together. So where does it go next!.

160
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,439
Now I know what a tossed salad feels like!

161
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,353
C'mon! Put the pedal to the metal, Liz!

162
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,590
Where are we now!??.!

163
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,999
I think we're trapped!

164
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,878
Something's wrong! Liz stopped turning the key!

165
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,871
Where did everybody go!??.!

166
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,915
Any body home!.

167
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,834
Thought for sure I heard this mechanical mistake
for a motor trying to turn over.

168
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,152
I must be working too hard.

169
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,196
All right, let's get outta here.

170
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,438
I knew I should have stayed home today!

171
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:35,230
HEY!!WAlT FOR ME! COME BACK HERE!!!I
HAVE AN AWARD TO PlCK UP!

172
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:53,630
I had such a good speech to give. Now I'll
NEVER get to give it! HELLLLLP..!.!!

173
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:13,358
HEY, GUYS! I DON'T KNOW lF YOU CAN HEAR
ME DOWN THERE BUT WE'RE BElNG TOWED
AWAY!

174
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,591
Oh bad oh bad oh bad bad bad!

175
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,874
Where's Liz!.

176
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,552
I don't know...

177
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,470
Friz to Liz! We're in the cylinder.

178
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,791
Liz! Try the key again!

179
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,832
Oh, boy! We're in real trouble now!

180
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:02,909
SHE'S ALL YOURS, MlKE! THE ¡®VMl' SAlD TO
CRUSH lT!

181
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,590
WHAT HAPPENED NOW!!??.

182
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,319
What was THAT!.

183
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,756
THlS lS ARNOLD! WE'RE lN THE JUNK
YARD!!!

184
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,912
What are we goanna do!. What are we goanna
do!. What are we goanna do!.

185
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,355
I wish I knew! I wish I knew!

186
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:29,149
NO! STOP! LET US DOWN!

187
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,912
ARNOLD! What's going on up there!.!

188
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,879
IF WE DON'T GET OUT OF HERE NOW -
WE'RE GONNA BE SMASHED!

189
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:46,272
We hear you, Arnold. Liz! Come in Liz!

190
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:53,118
I know this is difficult for you, but you have got to
turn the key!

191
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:01,033
We're moving! LlZ!!!

192
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,757
Hey! We're going down like an elevator.

193
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:08,632
That smells like... I think I smell gas!!!

194
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,349
Yeah, now the gas is following US!

195
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:18,989
Not to worry, class. When it comes to pistons -
what goes down must go up!

196
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,275
Maybe now the engine's going to start!

197
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,713
Oh! It should, Ralphie.

198
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,756
This heart-warming chamber is where

199
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:30,233
all three ingredients we need to get the engine
started come together.

200
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,275
Gas...

201
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,634
Air...

202
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,069
And... what else!.

203
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,072
LOOK OUT! WE'RE GONNA GET CRUSHED!

204
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,639
What happened!.

205
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,599
NOTHlNG happened! The engine STlLL won't
start!

206
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,680
At least we didn't get crushed!

207
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:59,511
STOP, YOU'RE GOlNG TO CRUSH US! GO
AWAY! DON'T DROP THAT!YOU'LL BE SORRY!

208
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,868
I don't get it, Ms Frizzle. We HAD gas - we HAD
air -

209
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,598
and the bus STlLL didn't run!

210
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,591
Maybe the engine is burned out.

211
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:14,231
That's it! That's what's missing! The engine burns
gas, remember!.

212
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,709
We need to find a way to get it to burn!

213
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,472
According to my research,

214
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,872
you have to be very careful around gasoline
because it burns so easily.

215
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:29,433
That's right, DA! In fact, a big fire can start with
just a little spark.

216
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,799
Gas, air and a spark! That's the 3 ingredients!

217
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,354
Did you say spark!. Like a sparkplug!. Like that
thing up there!.

218
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:45,629
What an explosive discovery, Carlos!

219
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,995
But, I don't see any sparks.

220
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,197
No wonder! More peanut butter!!!

221
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,312
Oh, no! We're going down again!

222
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,311
I'll get the peanut butter!

223
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,798
Oh no, there's more gas and air coming in.

224
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,677
Hang in there, Carlos!

225
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,470
Way to go, Carlos!

226
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,120
You cleaned off the spark plug!

227
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,551
It's a sticky job, but someone's got to do it!

228
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,438
Hey! Look at all that gas and air coming in!

229
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,397
The engine should fire up now!

230
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,074
Get ready to blow this joint!

231
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,115
Wait a minute! Just how big is this fire going to
be!.

232
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:44,510
As we travel with the burned gases, let's enjoy
the enchanting exhaust pipe

233
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,513
a tunnel of exotic fumes and dark surprises

234
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:52,832
that will take us into the metallic maze known
as...the muffler!

235
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:05,708
We did it, Ms Frizzle! We got the engine running
again!

236
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,317
And not a second too soon!!!

237
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,470
We gotta get the bus outta here!

238
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,950
Hit it, Liz! The Mesmer lobber should work now!

239
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,234
I don't think I'm going to like this!

240
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,152
Way to go!

241
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,636
We got gas to mix with air!

242
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,472
Added a spark and kaboom!

243
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,198
We've got the engine running again!

244
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,714
Liz, that was fantastic!

245
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,319
HlP HlP HOORAY! HlP HlP HOORAY!

246
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,152
Hold it! Where's Arnold!??.!

247
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,310
There he is, on the carburetor!

248
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,316
He's on his way to the cylinder!

249
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,918
Now he's about to go through the exhaust
system!!

250
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,037
Arnold, are you all right!.

251
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,238
I'm fine, Ms Frizzle. Anyone wants a peanut
butter sandwich!.

252
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,751
AR-NOLD!

253
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,628
Speaking of peanut butter. Where's Mr. Junket!.

254
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,113
We'll be right with you, Mr. Junket.

255
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,794
You hang on now, Mr. Junket!

256
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,878
Here he comes.

257
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,351
But Ms Frizzle, we can't let Mr. Junket know the
bus is magic.

258
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:54,430
HE CAN'T KNOW WHEN HE CAN'T SEE, can
he!. COVER ME!

259
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,637
You okay, Mr. Junket!.

260
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,756
You must have been scared.

261
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,034
Let me fix your cap.

262
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,792
Let me brush you off.

263
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,235
Okay bus, here we go...

264
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,274
EXCUUUUSE ME! EXCUUUUSE ME!

265
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:16,832
That's strange! I... I thought for a second that the
bus was a tow truck!

266
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:21,472
Hop in, Mr. Junket! There's still time to get your
award.

267
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,074
Looks like I owe you and your class an apology,
Ms Frizzle.

268
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,355
As my Great Aunt Jeanine used to say,

269
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:32,194
a good engine is worth the price of ignition!

270
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,913
Is that Magic School Bus!. Is that Magic School
Bus!.

271
00:21:51,000 --> 00:22:02,036
Magic School Bus!.

272
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,396
Magic School Bus.The Producer speaking.

273
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,678
Hi I just watched your show on Engines - it was a
real blast.

274
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:18,469
Only one question. Do you really expect us to
believe that Ms. Frizzle

275
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,791
and her class could stay alive inside a real
engine when it's running!.

276
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,916
It's more than three thousand degrees in there!

277
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,796
We know that.

278
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,440
It was just our way of showing you how an engine
works

279
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,080
up close and personal. Thanks for calling.

280
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,359
Magic School Bus.

281
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,839
Is this the producer!.

282
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,229
At your service. What can I do for you!.

283
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,548
About your engine show -

284
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,677
peanut butter is a pretty silly way to stop an
engine from working.

285
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:47,236
Silly, maybe - but it would sure gum up the
works.

286
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,833
Then why didn't they use gum!.

287
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:52,117
Thanks for calling. Why didn't I think of that!.

288
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,878
Magic School Bus.

289
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:00,034
Glad you're still there. My dad's a Vehicle
Maintenance lnspector and he told me

290
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:05,194
gasoline is extremely dangerous, either kids NOR
adults should ever play with it.

291
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,076
You're right,

292
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,118
and Dorothy Ann told the kids that when they
were inside the cylinder.

293
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,430
Oh yeah, I forgot.

294
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,190
But, that's okay, you can't be told that often
enough. Hold on a sec.

295
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,715
Hey! Careful with that gasoline, Liz!

296
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,478
Any other questions!.

297
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:28,712
Well, aren't there a lot more pieces to an engine
that you mentioned in your show!.

298
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:33,108
A lot. Like the radiator to keep the engine from
getting too hot.

299
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,919
And the battery that makes the sparkplug spark.

300
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,357
BUT WE CAN ONLY SHOW SO MANY lN A
THlRTY MlNUTE PROGRAM.

301
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,556
WOULD YOU MlND CALLlNG BACK!.!

302
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:48,872
LlZ!HEY, LlZ! TURN THAT THlNG OFF - I CAN'T
HEAR!!!

303
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,512
Magic School Bus. Producer speaking.
