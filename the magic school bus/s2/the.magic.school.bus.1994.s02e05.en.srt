1
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,195
Broccoli? You've gotta be kidding!

2
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,316
Who ever heard of a broccoli mascot?

3
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,311
According to my research, broccoli is a very
healthy vegetable.

4
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,915
Besides, all the animal mascots have been done
already!

5
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,389
Get serious, our soccer team

6
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,155
can't be called the Walker Elementary School
Broccolis!

7
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,629
Why can't we just use the old mascot?.

8
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,598
Because it's so old, no one knows what it is
anymore!

9
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,395
Yuck, it's even got moths!

10
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,353
Tim, no! How could you?.

11
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,668
It's just a bug!

12
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,752
Look at it, it's MORE than a bug!

13
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,719
For your information, it says in this book that this
moth is one of over

14
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,872
100,000 different kinds of moths and butterflies

15
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,396
And scientists are still finding new ones! And by
the way,

16
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,519
there are about eight times as many kinds of
moths as there are butterflies!

17
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,070
Excuse me, Phoebe, in exactly six hours,

18
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,276
we're playing the biggest soccer game of the
year...

19
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,839
for which we need a new mascot,

20
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,469
and you've got your head buried in a
BUTTERFLY BOOK!

21
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,109
Actually, Ralphie, it's a butterfly and MOTH book.

22
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,832
There's not a lot of difference, but there's
definitely-

23
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,478
PHOE-BEEEEE!!!

24
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,199
We need a mascot that's different!

25
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,989
It's gotta be so exciting the other team won't
know what hit ~em!!

26
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,718
I got it! I got it!

27
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,835
WHAT???.!

28
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,230
The Walker Elementary School BUTTERFLlES!

29
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,909
You want to name our soccer team the
BUTTERFLlES???.!

30
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,070
And have a mascot that's small...

31
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,229
swatable...

32
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,435
And PRETTY?.!?.

33
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,954
But butterflies are full of surprises!

34
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,314
Like what!!?.

35
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,231
Yeah, like what?.!

36
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,033
Janet!!

37
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,596
The one and only! Arnold's favorite cousin!

38
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,877
I AM your favorite cousin, right Arnold?.

39
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,190
You're my ONLY cousin Janet.

40
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,510
You're so cute.

41
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,878
We know the REAL reason you want to make a
complete wimp

42
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,394
Iike a butterfly the MASCOT!

43
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,435
You do?.

44
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,316
We do?.!

45
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,269
Isn't today's soccer game against YOUR OLD
SCHOOL?.

46
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,476
Janet's right, the Bulldogs are Phoebe's old team.

47
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,193
Whose side are you on, Phoebe?.

48
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,555
I'm on OUR side! I just thought--

49
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,719
Listen, you're looking for a new mascot, right?.

50
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,676
Right!

51
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,309
You want a mascot that's totally different, right?.

52
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,549
RlGHT!!

53
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,030
Then get this! How about the Walker Elementary
School...

54
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:47,473
um... um...Walker Elementary School... BOG
BEASTS!

55
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,791
YEAHHHHH...

56
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,835
It's new!

57
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,035
It's different!

58
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,588
It's so surprising they won't know what hit them!

59
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,554
ummm...What's a Bog Beast?.

60
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,638
A crafty question, Arnold!

61
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,518
Ms Frizzle!

62
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,875
Anyone know what a Bog Beast looks like?.

63
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,516
Let's see, how about you?. Janet?.

64
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,958
Well, it's ah... probably like...ah... ah...a friend told
me about one.

65
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:29,353
According to my research, a bog is wet, soggy
ground - like a swamp.

66
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:34,349
Seems to me, then, a swamp's the place to go to
find a Bog Beast.

67
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,431
But what about our soccer game?.

68
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,149
What's a game without a mascot?. TO THE
SWAMP!!

69
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,797
Not another field trip.

70
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,635
Cheer up, Arnold. A famous poet once said: "All
the world's a field trip -

71
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,393
and all the kids in our class merely guinea pigs."

72
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,198
Or did Ms Frizzle say that?.

73
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,190
Ms Frizzle, does the swamp have butterflies, too?.

74
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,397
The swamp has all sorts of surprises, Phoebe.

75
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,037
I knew she'd say that.

76
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,398
Everyone on the look for a bog beast!

77
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,152
Excuse me, Ms Frizzle,

78
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,310
but we're driving right into the SWAMP!

79
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,959
Not to worry, Ralphie, where the road ends -
adventure begins!

80
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,919
What is this place, Ms Frizzle?.

81
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,917
It's called Butterfly Bog.

82
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,117
I thought those butterflies were flowers.

83
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,990
Looks can be deceiving, Wanda. Often times,
what is - isn't.And what isn't - is.

84
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:15,753
Aahhh...Aren't they magnificent?.!Some mascot!

85
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,516
If Bluejays can do THAT - what are the Bulldogs
gonna do to your soccer team?.

86
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,230
Or is that what you want to happen, huh, Phoebe?.

87
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,070
NO!

88
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,628
Seems to me, butterflies are SO pretty -

89
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,439
every animal can spot ~em for a mile around.

90
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,954
Yeah, especially bog beasts!

91
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:41,591
Well...oooh...Come here little butterfly. Forget
about it, Liz!

92
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,993
Hey, do you think a butterfly's beautiful just to be
beautiful

93
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,509
Or is there another reason?.

94
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,830
I think there's more to butterflies than YOU
know...

95
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,871
I just wish it would hold still.

96
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,475
I'll get it to hold still!That'll prove what a wimp it is!

97
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,916
I think this is going to be one of those more
memorable field trips.

98
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,717
Here we are...Bog Beast Landing.

99
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,029
Now what?.

100
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,635
We camouflage the boat so it blends in with the
environment -

101
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,915
then we wait for the Bog Beast.

102
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,197
There's no time to wait! We have to catch one
now!

103
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,191
According to my research,

104
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:32,068
the best way to catch something is to use some
kind of bait.

105
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,675
Like the biggest, juiciest butterfly in the bog!

106
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,789
Come on, Liz, let's bag us a butterfly!

107
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,072
JANET! NO!

108
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,954
YESSS!

109
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,997
Why don't you pick on somebody your own size?.!

110
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,432
An idea worth expressing, Phoebe...or
compressing!

111
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,715
I'll shrink ~em with the portashrinker!

112
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,677
The Portashrinker?.

113
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,638
OH NO!

114
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,470
What a surprise...We're a different size!!

115
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,120
Oh no! We've shrunk!

116
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,437
And look over there The portashrinker's zapped
out!

117
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,669
Well, I don't care how small I am! I've got
butterflies to save!

118
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,071
Phoebe, come baaaack!

119
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,517
Fly for your lives, butterflies!Fly away! FLY FOR
YOUR...

120
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,034
PHOEBE!

121
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,836
WHAT lS lT?.

122
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,716
WHAT HAPPENED?.

123
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,717
BOG BEAST!

124
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,195
Okay, we've seen the bog beast, let's get outta
here!!

125
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:05,831
Uh-uh. Not so fast, Ralphie!Since you've never
seen a bog beast.

126
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,912
How can you be sure this is a bog beast?.

127
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,029
It looks more like a snake to me.

128
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:18,194
Then it's not a bog beast. It's just a--
SNAAAAAAAAKE!

129
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,231
Except it doesn't MOVE like a snake- it moves
like a caterpillar!

130
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,594
Hey, it is a caterpillar.

131
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,240
A caterpillar PRETENDlNG to be a snake!

132
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,677
Got a little nervous, eh Ralphie?. Hey, it FOOLED
me, too!

133
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,511
Gee, I remember when I was BlGGER than a
caterpillar.

134
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,275
And BlGGER than a praying mantis,too!

135
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,272
Don't Praying Mantises EAT caterpillars?.

136
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,756
Not if they think they're snakes!

137
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,758
Exactly, Tim! A delightfully deceitful deception!

138
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,034
I get it!

139
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,796
It's called tricking your enemy by pretending to be
something you're not!!

140
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,438
I'd call it good acting!

141
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,988
I'd call it a Swallowtail caterpillar!

142
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,036
Hey! What if we call our team

143
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,396
the Walker Elementary School Swallowtail
Caterpillars?.!

144
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,835
Caterpillars?.!We'll get laughed out of the game!

145
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,071
Besides, if we don't get back soon, there won't
BE any game!

146
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,754
Caterpillar's are tougher than you think, Ralphie
-

147
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:35,755
they're survivors. They live by the rule, ~fool or be
food!'

148
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,956
And if it KEEPS fooling them - and keeps
FEEDlNG itself,someday...

149
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,150
it'll change into a chrysalis.

150
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,879
Then it'll turn into a big,beautiful butterfly!

151
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,836
I see one, Liz!

152
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,868
Shoo, butterfly, shoo!C'mon fly away!

153
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,678
Come along now Phoebe.

154
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,514
Oh, it's not fair, Ms Frizzle.

155
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,070
Oh, I know. Janet doesn't stand a chance!

156
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:22,911
This one's a real JUlCY one!Where'd it go?.
Where is it?.

157
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,828
Okay, wise-guy, where are you?.

158
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:34,111
There it is... I think.What a disappearing act!

159
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,198
It's camouflaged so you can't see it against the
log!

160
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,317
Another illustrious illusion,Tim!

161
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:45,428
I always say, if they can't see you, ho ho, - they
can't eat you.

162
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,752
Pile in, class!

163
00:11:55,400 --> 00:12:00,394
So...there you are. The bog beast is going to love
you.

164
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,236
Oh, no! Janet's going to catch that butterfly!

165
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,197
You're mine now, wimp!

166
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,517
SWAMP SWlLL!

167
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,439
YESSSSSSSSSS...! The butterfly got away!

168
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,158
A little mud can't stop us now!

169
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,153
Come on, Liz, we can't catch a bog beast without
a butterfly!

170
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,515
Okay, that's it! I'm unshrinking us all right now!

171
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,637
Before Jumbo Janet crushes us into pieces!

172
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,514
What's that?.

173
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,794
The Dew-Dinger.

174
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,757
The Dew-Dinger?.

175
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,719
Yes. The Dew-Dinger dings when the
portashrinker is too wet to work.

176
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,631
So we're stuck this size until--

177
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:49,352
Until the portashrinker dries out. So ARNOLD...
Start blowing!

178
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,672
Why couldn't Janet shrink instead of me?. Life
would be so much easier.

179
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,196
Hurry, Arnold!If we don't get bigger by game time,

180
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,636
the other team won't HAVE to crush us -the
BALL will!

181
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,593
This is all your fault, Phoebe - you

182
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,999
and your butterflies!

183
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,868
Maybe Janet was right - maybe you DO want
your old school to win the game.

184
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:14,398
I do not! And I'm NOT wrong about a butterfly. It
would make a GREAT mascot!

185
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:24,118
For a place called Butterfly Bog it's not exactly
bursting with BUTTERFLlES One!

186
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,316
I only need one!

187
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,917
Let go! I can't see.Get your hands off!

188
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,119
Janet! I'd know that scream anywhere.

189
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,792
Come on, let's go!

190
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,709
BOG BEEEEAST!!!

191
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,791
It's not a Bog Beast -it's a Zebra Butterfly!

192
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:01,956
So, Ralphie, how does it feel to be the boy who
cried bog beast?.

193
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:06,158
Well, it, um... just startled me with it's colors,
that's all!

194
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,635
See?. Even though butterflies are small and
pretty, they're NOT wimps!

195
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,277
They trick you, hide from you, even SCARE you!

196
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,512
That's how they stay alive!

197
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,795
Sounds like the perfect mascot to me!

198
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,077
All in favor of the Walker Elementary School
Butterflies!

199
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:29,188
NEVER! I'll play for the other team before anyone
calls me a butterfly!

200
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,440
It's a... a... a...

201
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,080
Yeah, we know, Ralphie - bog beast.

202
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,470
BOG BEEEEEAST!

203
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,788
That's not a bog beast!

204
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,919
And those eyes aren't real - they just LOOK like
eyes to fool the enemy.

205
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,679
Ahhh! An inSlGHTFUL observation, Phoebe.

206
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,549
And the EYEdeal name: BuckEYE.

207
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,757
You know, I'm beginning to think Phoebe's onto
something!

208
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:12,512
Butterflies ARE new and exciting.And they're
tricky!And boy are they surprising!

209
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,034
All the things we want our soccer team to be!

210
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,557
Okay, Phoebe, you win. Maybe there's more to
butterflies than meets the eye.

211
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,916
Especially if they can scare a tough guy like you,
right?.

212
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,312
Ah...well...the Walker Elementary School
Butterflies it is!

213
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,073
Let's take our team to the skies!

214
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,272
Let's be Walker Elementary School
BETTERFLlES!

215
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,237
If you insist.

216
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,797
The biggest, juiciest butterfly yet!

217
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,917
So what do you think, class?.

218
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,191
Well, it's certainly a new sensation, all right.

219
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,395
It's different!

220
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,833
It's surprising!

221
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,116
IT'S JANET!

222
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,511
Do something, Ms Frizzle!

223
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,793
Still wet.

224
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,399
OH NO!!

225
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,712
This butterfly's not only a wimp -it's DlNGY!

226
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,631
Janet's gonna feed us to the Bog Beast!

227
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,758
You won't get away this time!

228
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,870
She's gaining on us!

229
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,918
What should we do?. What should we do?. What
should we do?.

230
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,551
Well, as I always say, when a butterfly -- do as
the butterflies do.

231
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,789
Wait a second!

232
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,078
Is there a button on this thing that'll make us
blend in like real butterflies do?.

233
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,151
You might check the camouflage box.

234
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,153
Oh, no! Which button is it?.

235
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,679
Hurry, Phoebe!

236
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,911
According to my research--

237
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,634
No time for research, Dorothy Ann...

238
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:16,195
only time for getting messy -taking chances - and
making mistakes!

239
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,111
With all due respect, Ms Frizzle, here's hoping
this isn't a mistake!

240
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:32,436
Hey! Where'd it go?. It just disappeared!

241
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,230
She's gonna see us!

242
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,878
Everybody quiet!

243
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:46,310
The portashrinker must be dry by now!Come on,
come on... MAKE US BlG!

244
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,233
Arnold...WAlT! If it's not dry, the dew-dinger...

245
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,233
What was that?.!!

246
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,035
Ah ha! GOT'CHA!

247
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,593
Oh, no! She got us!

248
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,432
Just keep drying!

249
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,795
Come on, Phoebe, you're our last hope!

250
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:09,512
Think butterfly...think butterfly! That's it! I'll
surprise her with colors!

251
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:19,111
RED! MORE RED!YELLOW! MORE
YELLOW!ORANGE! MORE ORANGE!BLUE!

252
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,159
And now to trick her with eyespots!

253
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,474
Big...bigger...BlGGEST!

254
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,472
At last...you're mine!

255
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,636
Not yet, Janet!

256
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,318
Hit it Phoebe!

257
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,757
ALL RlGHT, PHOEBE!

258
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,513
Way to go!Nice one

259
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,874
We're safe!

260
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,157
Now THAT deception got a real reception!

261
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,471
Buterflies hide, trick, surprise --

262
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,472
I guess they really can take care of themselves.

263
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,198
What a field trip!

264
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,277
Gee, Janet, what happened to you?.

265
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,396
You almost lost a cousin, Arnold.

266
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,792
It was jump in the swamp - or go head to head
with the Bog Beast!

267
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,313
Oh, really?.

268
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,790
Yeah, and you're not going to believe what it
looked like!

269
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:33,589
Was it anything like...this BUSSERFLY?.

270
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:43,913
THAT'S lT! I, cousin Janet, saw the Bog Beast
and- did you say BUTTERFLY?????.

271
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,115
Uh-huh!

272
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,630
You mean there's no such thing as a Bog-beast?.

273
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,349
A bog beast can be anything that lives in this
swamp, Janet!

274
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,432
In this case, it turned out to be a butterfly.

275
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,672
Well, I uh... I sorta knew that -yeah- if l... umm
-yeah-

276
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:05,756
Janet, you've got it!The best possible mascot!The
BOG BEAST BUTTERFLY!!!

277
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,913
Yeah! Why not?. I guess we were BOTH right,
huh, Phoebe.

278
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,791
The score is tied - only thirty seconds remain.

279
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,313
The Butterflies have the ball.

280
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,868
Phoebe is dribbling it toward the Bulldogs' goal.

281
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:28,557
Bulldogs, Bulldogs. Fleas-y. Fleas-y. We're
gonna beat ya easy, easy.

282
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:33,111
Phoebe, Phoebe break the tie. Be our winning
butterfly!

283
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,314
Oh, my! The Bulldogs steal the ball!

284
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,152
Come on, Phoebe, get up!

285
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:44,270
Remember, butterflies are new and exciting...and
we NEVER give up!

286
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:55,756
It looks bad for the Butter... Wait! Keesha steals
the ball back!

287
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:01,675
Carlos kicks the ball to Tim. Tim kicks the ball to
Phoebe!

288
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:15,436
Ohh! Time is running out!
Five...four...three...two... SCOR...

289
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:21,715
The Butterflies win...the Bog Beast Butterflies
win! YESSS!

290
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,392
WAY TO GO PHOEBE!

291
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,469
WAY TO GO JANET!

292
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:28,712
As I always say, there's no surprise like
butterflies!

293
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,118
Is it the magic school bus?.

294
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,394
Is it the magic school bus?.

295
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,469
The magic school bus?.

296
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,436
Is it the magic school bus?.

297
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,635
Is it the magic school bus?.

298
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,675
The magic school bus?.

299
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,035
The magic school bus?.

300
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,078
Hello Hello!

301
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,997
Is this the Magic School Bus?.

302
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,036
Yes, this is the Producer speaking.

303
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,153
Well, I'm from GMM...and I'm steamed!

304
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,434
GMM?.

305
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,033
The Great Moth Majority.

306
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,430
I just saw your butterfly show and from what l
saw,

307
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,270
you don't seem to know that

308
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,476
there are more different kinds of MOTHS than
butterflies!

309
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,913
I DO know that.

310
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,752
But you didn't give them equal time?.

311
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,757
We hardly had time to cover butterflies properly.

312
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,469
Well, MOTHS and butterflies don't just have
eyespots for surprise, you know.

313
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,629
If you say so.

314
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,475
When a bird tries to catch a MOTH or butterfly it
goes for the eyes...

315
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:57,111
and if it goes for the eyespots all it gets is a beak
full of wing.

316
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,634
Believe me, I'd put a moth in the show...

317
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,151
If I could only CATCH ONE!

318
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,156
Catch one?.! That reminds me.

319
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,391
Janet running around trying to catch a butterfly
with a net

320
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,789
was insensitive and inappropriate field study.

321
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:18,954
Yes, but that's Janet's character, insensitive and
inappropriate.

322
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,917
That doesn't excuse improper behavior!

323
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,070
MOTHS and butterflies should be left alone.

324
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,639
You're right.

325
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,473
By the way, butterflies aren't only found in the
swamp.

326
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,357
You can find them almost anywhere.

327
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,509
Right again.

328
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:36,470
You can find them in the forest...the desert...the
mountains... in a shoe.

329
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,515
In a shoe?.

330
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,078
I don't know about a shoe,

331
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,631
but I DO know when the Great Moth Majority is
done with you,

332
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,836
you'll probably be looking for another job.

333
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:53,072
Funny you should mention that - I'm trying out for
another job right now.

334
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,559
And what would that be?.

335
00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:01,193
NET-WORK producer! Gotcha!!!!!!!!!!!
