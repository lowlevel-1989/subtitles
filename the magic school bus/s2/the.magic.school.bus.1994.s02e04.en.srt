1
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,519
And Keesha said, "let there be night!"

2
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,471
And I say, "let there be Ms Frizzle!"Where is she
anyway?

3
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,835
Yeah, our parents will be here any minute.

4
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,992
Oh! Hope they like our display of nocturnal
animals.

5
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,072
Animals that come out at night are my personal
favorites.

6
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:36,632
I don't know about you guys, but parent-teacher
conferences make me nervous.

7
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,108
I vant to suck your blood!

8
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,399
Chill out, Arnold, it's just me. Your ordinary
creature of the night.

9
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,438
Knock it off, Ralphie...there are no vampires.

10
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,272
They only exist in your imagination.

11
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,353
That's what you think! Bats are just vampires in
disguise.

12
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,830
Come on, guys, the Friz wants us to set up the
attic, too.

13
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,959
The vampire looked around the room of
half-humans - half bats,

14
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:14,398
and said: ''Attention my beloved children, at last
the moment

15
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,630
I've been waiting for is here.''

16
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,837
Whoa, it's dark up here.

17
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,753
uh... (heh) why don't I go get a flashlight.

18
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,150
What's the matter Mr. Vampire Expert...afraid of
the dark?

19
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,755
No, l'm not afraid! I just can't see, that's all.

20
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,991
Maybe You can't, Ralphie...but THAT can!

21
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,629
Ooh...a bat! A REAL creature of the night.

22
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,109
uh, it sure is creepy!

23
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,998
I don't know, I think it's kinda cute.

24
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,119
Creepy or cute, this is ONE animal of the night
we know very LlTTLE about!

25
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,637
Maybe that's why we're afraid of them. We don't
really know much about them.

26
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,108
Don't hurt it!

27
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,716
Don't let it get me! I don't want to be turned into
a-a-a vampire!

28
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,157
Relax, Ralphie, this is real life, not some made-up
story!

29
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:11,109
That little bat has as much chance of being a
vampire as...What was that?

30
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:18,116
YlKES! MS FRlZZLE!

31
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,836
Good evening, class!

32
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,230
Ah, I see you found my animal of the night.

33
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:30,759
So dark of wing and keen of craft, of all night
fliers, the master's a bat!

34
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,515
That's just the kind of thing a vampire would say!

35
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,590
Come on, Ralphie, you've been reading too many
comic books!

36
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:47,028
Ah. Come, come, don't be afraid. Let me show
you the secrets of being nocturnal.

37
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,237
When you're a creature of the night - you wear
the color of night,

38
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,118
so you won't be seen by your enemies.

39
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,953
You stay hidden until the sun has set.

40
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,429
The darker the night, the safer the flight.

41
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:03,674
And of course, being nocturnal - you feed only
during the night.

42
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,439
Ralphie!

43
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,636
Is something wrong?.

44
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,474
Wrong?. No, uh uh. Nothing. No.

45
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,232
Ah, the PARENTS have arrived.

46
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,996
This is my grandmother, Ms Frizzle.

47
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,868
Ah! How nice to finally meet you. Keesha has told
me so much about you...

48
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,394
I could just eat you up.

49
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:34,110
Did you hear that?. Ms Frizzle wants to eat
Keesha's Grandmother!

50
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,873
Ralphie, dear, aren't we going to say hello to Ms
Frizzle?.

51
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,238
Actually, Mom, I uh...she uh...she's kinda busy
right now.

52
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,198
Oh, Ralphie, stop being a pain in the neck.

53
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,352
You think l'M a pain in the neck. Just wait!

54
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,352
Ah, Dr. Tinelli, how good to see you again.

55
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,194
And you, Ms Frizzle. Ralphie's been raving about
your field trips.

56
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:59,149
Yes, well, I do so enjoy taking him under my
wing.

57
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,913
Heh-heh. um. Excuse me, please.

58
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,755
You gotta believe me! The Friz must be a
vampire!

59
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,594
The Friz CAN'T be a vampire - she's our teacher!

60
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,150
Maybe during the day - but what about at night,
huh?.

61
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,074
Didn't she say ¡®the darker the night - the safer
the flight'?.

62
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,312
She was talking about BATS! If it's dark they
blend in -

63
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,393
and their enemies can't see them.... It says so
right here in my book!

64
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,189
Vampires like the dark, too! And NlGHT is when
they strike -

65
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,989
which is exactly why Ms Frizzle wanted our
parents here after dark!

66
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,354
Stop it, Ralphie!

67
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,194
Our parents are here at night because they're too
busy during the day.

68
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,474
And that's all!

69
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,039
Your attention, please!

70
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,838
Before we all visit the classroom,

71
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,831
I thought for the parents-only portion of the
evening

72
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:52,598
, we might go someplace more...suitable,
more... uh...brrrreath-taking!

73
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,439
Come along, I won't bite.

74
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,792
NOW do you believe me?.

75
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,916
Is this a field trip, Ms Frizzle?.

76
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,709
It is indeed, Mr. Perlstein. Arnold adores them.

77
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,349
At Phoebe's old school, we never had field trips.
This is gonna be fun.

78
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,512
What about the children?. Aren't they coming with
us?.

79
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:17,037
Don't you worry about the children, Mrs.
Franklin...they'll be taken care of.

80
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,230
Yikes! We're next!

81
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,316
Wonder where Ms Frizzle's taking them?.

82
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,757
I don't know, but we have to find out! Follow that
bus!

83
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,035
Ooohh! You've gone too far, Ralphie!

84
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,076
There's no reason for us to spy on their meeting!

85
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,718
Stay here if you want, Keesh.

86
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,518
But how are you going to feel

87
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,831
if you're grandmother starts sleeping in a box in
the basement?.

88
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:48,675
That's absolutely ridiculous! huh, But I guess
there's no harm in making sure.

89
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,313
Hit it, Liz!

90
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,916
We're here!

91
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,155
I bid you welcome!

92
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,392
BATS! Night flyers, we used to call ¡®em.

93
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,235
Why would Ms Frizzle bring our parents to a
place full of bats!

94
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,117
AND mosquitos!

95
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:42,957
Because she's a VAMPlRE, that's why! What
more proof do you need?.

96
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:47,989
Ralphie! Ms Frizzle CAN'T be a vampire, because
vampires DON'T exist!

97
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,038
I'm sure there's a perfectly logical explanation for
all this -

98
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,395
and l'm going to find out what it is!

99
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,993
Well, go ahead, Ralphie, open the door.

100
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,479
It was YOuR idea!

101
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,791
Move aside, you weasly wimps! I'LL do it!

102
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,679
Now what!

103
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,830
Okay. We can go back to school now.

104
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,878
No we can't, Arnold. We've got parents to save!

105
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,394
Come on, there's a window over there!

106
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,549
Admit it, Ralphie, this vampire thing is a bunch of
junk! You're making it up!

107
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:28,233
Oh, yeah?. Then explain why Ms Frizzle...is
making our parents drink blood!

108
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:34,589
Ah, to the creatures of the night long may we fly
together.

109
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,830
Hold it! They're not drinking blood -

110
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,595
it's tomato juice, like Ms Frizzle served at the
class picnic.

111
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,430
Oh, yeah?.!

112
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:01,036
The only way to stop a teacher vampire is to drive
a textbook through her heart!

113
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,916
Let's go!

114
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,549
Get away, you bloodsuckers! Vampires?.!

115
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,358
No, mosquitos!

116
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,635
Huh. More bats!

117
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,517
We're gonna be eaten alive!

118
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,237
Wait a minute!

119
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,519
Hey! The bats don't want to eat us, they want to
eat the mosquitos! Look!!

120
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,510
Which PROVES they aren't vampires!

121
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,353
Right! And give me back my book!

122
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,594
It's rough.

123
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,798
Good place to hang from - if you've got claws.
How dark is it in here?.

124
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,314
Dark enough to sleep in - night OR day.

125
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,076
What lS that smell?.

126
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,628
Bat poop, Mr. Perlstein. Get used to it.

127
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:47,437
Bat GuANO, to be more exact, Mr. Ramone. It
makes excellent fertilizer.

128
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,317
Walk this way please...

129
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,470
It certainly is stuffy in here.

130
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,757
It's the breath of a billion bats, Dr. Tinelli.

131
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,515
Well, you know what they say. Bat breath is
better than no breath at all.

132
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,711
MR. RAMONE!

133
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,878
Oh good oh good - little pink babies.

134
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,191
Ah, yes, the children of the night.

135
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,277
Ohh, aren't those bat babies cute!

136
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:27,037
SEE, Ralphie?.! Bats are mammals not vampires.
Their babies drink milk, not blood!

137
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,350
Get down! The Friz is coming!

138
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,794
I can look if I want to!

139
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,835
Can not!

140
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,035
Can so!

141
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,235
Can not!

142
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,598
You know, I didn't know that bats take care of
their young.

143
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,151
Ah, indeed they do, Mrs. Franklin. Bats make
excellent mothers.

144
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,109
Even on a wall full of pups, they recognize the
sound of their own.

145
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,478
Oh. Just like me. I'd know the sound of my
Keesha anywhere.

146
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,232
CAN SO!

147
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:55,991
Can not!

148
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,195
Keesha!?.!

149
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,951
Hmmm, no one out there...only some juicy tidbits
for the bats.

150
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:06,477
¡®Kidbits?.!' She's talking about us! She's gonna
feed us to the bats.

151
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,391
We gotta get help!

152
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,031
She said ¡®TlDbits' not ¡®kidbits!

153
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,149
Ralphie, what are you trying to do?.!

154
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:26,395
Get us outta here before she turns us ALL into
vampires! Wonder what this does?.

155
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,796
Nice one, Ralphie. You turned the bus into a bat!

156
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:43,236
And THlS is turning into a field trip!

157
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,709
Where're we going?.

158
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,392
I don't know, it's too dark to tell.

159
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,313
Is - is it just me or does everything look really
weird?.

160
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,029
Well, what'd you expect?. The bus is a bat,
remember?.

161
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,793
What if we crash into something?.

162
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,794
Whew! That was close!

163
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,918
Look out look out!

164
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,877
Bats, bats everywhere!!

165
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,518
And they're making so much noise!

166
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,876
I didn't hear that before the bus turned into a bat!!

167
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,635
Awesome! How does the bus keep from running
into stuff?.

168
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,359
It must be because it's a bat, that's how!

169
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,115
The Bat-Bus knows how to get around in the
dark, like them.

170
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,349
But HOW?.!

171
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,398
I think it's got something to do with that pinging
sound.

172
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:40,079
I don't know about you guys, but that pinging is
killing my ears!

173
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,474
I can tell you this...every time the bat opens its
mouth I hear a ping!

174
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:54,400
Yeah! And then its ears wiggle! I think it's
LlSTENlNG to the echo of each ping!

175
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:00,232
I hope the Bat-bus is listening now or we're
gonna crash!!

176
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,431
Wow! That's it!

177
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,238
When the sounds echo back -

178
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,153
the bat bus knows something's there and doesn't
bump into it!

179
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,279
That must be what the bats are doing...when they
make that funny sound!!

180
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,669
They're using echoes to locate things...

181
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,991
Echoes to locate...echolocation.

182
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:24,153
Bats don't need to see with their eyes - they can
see with their ears!

183
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,360
Weird! But cool! Bats use sound to get around!

184
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,352
Moths, dead-ahead!

185
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,874
Oh, no! Don't tell me that the bus is hungry!

186
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,752
Ick! At least we know how bats grab a bite to eat!

187
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,431
Oooh! Yuck! Disgusto!

188
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,193
And night is a good time for bats to eat,

189
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,238
because they're experts at finding food in the
dark.

190
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,880
Not because they like to scare people, Ralphie.

191
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,679
Yeah, well, we don't have time for midnight
snacks.

192
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,591
We have to get back to the castle!

193
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,229
Come on, Ralphie, admit it - bats are cool.

194
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,039
And if you were a night animal - you'd want to be
one!

195
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:13,468
I would not!...Or would l?. A bat could fly back to
the castle in the dark -

196
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:17,030
find a way inside - and save his parents from
Count FRlZuLA!

197
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,991
Ralphie! What are you doing?.

198
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,389
Winging this thing back to the castle!

199
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,634
Yep, Ralphie, you sure know how to wing it!

200
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,518
This wasn't exactly what I had in mind.

201
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:46,390
Hey, I love being a bat! Bet I can do 0-60 in three
seconds flat!

202
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,270
Watch me, Tim! I can turn on a dime!

203
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,555
It's not bad being a bat!

204
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:59,156
You can catch a drink on the fly...and a fly on the
drink!

205
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,310
Hmm, not bad.

206
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,076
Or snag a moth on the wing...WlTH your wing!

207
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,949
I wish I could turn off the moon. That light gives
me the creeps.

208
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,474
Yeah, me, too! Wonder why?.

209
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,915
OWL ALERT!

210
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,479
OWL ALERT!!!

211
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,959
YllllKES!

212
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,272
THAT'S why we avoid light! Our enemies can see
us in it!

213
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:39,309
¡®The darker the night, the safer the flight'. Just
like Ms Frizzle said.

214
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:43,279
And she oughta know. She's the QuEEN of the
night!

215
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,630
By now our parents could be...

216
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:51,593
What if Ralphie's right?. What if Ms Frizzle lS a
vampire!

217
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,955
No way! It's not true! Ralphie's NEVER right!

218
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,828
Attention parents of my dear beloved children!

219
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,319
It's the Friz!

220
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:03,439
At last, the moment l've been waiting for has
come!

221
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:09,277
That's exactly what the vampire in my comic book
said! TO THE CASTLE!

222
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,839
Wait for me!

223
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,959
I don't want to believe it - but l'm beginning to!

224
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,878
Prepare yourselves, for your time has come!

225
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,669
Oh! Something terrible's happening!

226
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:31,753
And who would like to be my first victim?.

227
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,752
I TOLD you she was a VAMPlRE!

228
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,718
Take me, Ms Frizzle. Take me!

229
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,678
GRANDMA!

230
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,873
DON'T YOu DARE BlTE MY
GRANDMOTHERRRRR!!

231
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,118
¡®The darker the night...the more I think Ralphie's
right'!

232
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,668
The Friz COuLD be a vampire!

233
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,957
Yeah, and I don't want my dad to have nose
flaps!

234
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:03,749
So, what are we waiting for?. Let's go!

235
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,878
It's really really dark down here.

236
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,394
Yeah. We'll never find Ms Frizzle!

237
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:16,793
We're bats, guys, remember?. To find a location -
use echolocation!

238
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,473
FOLLOW ME!!!

239
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,719
MORE BATS!!!

240
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,997
There must be millions and millions of them!

241
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,595
Yeah, millions of PARENTS turned into bats!

242
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,668
This way!

243
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:43,958
Bat or no bat, I just don't like the dark. WAlT
FOR ME, GuYS!

244
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,596
Wha-what happened?????.

245
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:54,754
You forgot! If a bat can't hear, it can't tell where
it's going! Come on!

246
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,235
Hold on, Grandma!

247
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,869
I heard Keesha! Let's go!

248
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,918
There she is!

249
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,116
They're in the next room! Listen.

250
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,078
So what do you think of our field trip, now?.

251
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,550
I can't believe I let you do this to me!

252
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,791
My neck will be sore for a week.

253
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,269
GASP! That's my MOM! LET'S GO!!!

254
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,715
Maybe we SHOuLD have stayed home tonight!

255
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,712
Dad! You took the words right out of my mouth!!!

256
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,950
What about the kids, Ms Frizzle?.

257
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,675
Will they suffer the same fate as us?.

258
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,558
Of course! They're MlNE, too, aren't they?.

259
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,273
I love you anyway, daddy! I'll love you...forever.

260
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,999
We can't let the Friz get away with this!

261
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,789
What are we going to do?. What are we going to
do?. What are we going to do?.

262
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,440
Make sure she never does this again!

263
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:01,789
Whew! Huh?. Enough blood rushing to the head!
Everyone down now.

264
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,519
Time to get back to school to see the class
project.

265
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,149
Aw, do we have to?. I could hang around for
another hour.

266
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,676
MR. RAMONE!

267
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,639
That was incredible! I really felt like a bat.

268
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,077
Me, too. I used to be afraid of bats - but not
anymore.

269
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,994
As I always say, to be a bat - is to love a bat.

270
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,631
It's no wonder Phoebe loves your field trips, Ms
Frizzle.

271
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,439
I'm so glad we transferred her from that other
school.

272
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,196
As Keesha says, they're simply magic!

273
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,950
She doesn't know the half of it! Nice going,
Ralphie!

274
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,749
More bats! They must be coming home from night
school.

275
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,789
Is it just me, or do those bats look like our kids?.

276
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,908
Oh. Why so they do! uh! What a wonderful
co-winky-dink!

277
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,677
How could you ever think Ms Frizzle was a
vampire?.

278
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,194
I can't believe we listened to you!

279
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:00,637
Hey, she LOOKED like a vampire -uh-MOVED
like a vampire -

280
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,278
and TALKED like a vampire.

281
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:06,319
In any decent movie - she would've BEEN a
vampire!

282
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,952
Not good enough, Ralphie! It was only your
imagination!

283
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,112
I-l'm sorry. I-I was wrong about the Friz.

284
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,671
She's really a good teacher who just...gets
wrapped up in her work!

285
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,028
And you were wrong about bats, too.

286
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,554
Okay, they're NOT vampires.

287
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,519
They're nocturnal animals that use echolocation
to fly at night.

288
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,750
And WHY do they come out at night?.

289
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,308
They come out at night to feed. Okay?.

290
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,994
And WHAT do they feed on?. Come on, say it.

291
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:41,313
Okay, okay, okay! They feed on insects - not
human blood! You happy now?.

292
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:46,394
Keesha may be happy, but the BAT news is -
WE'RE STlLL BATS!

293
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,914
Fangs for reminding us, Carlos.

294
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,637
PHOE-BE!

295
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,517
YAY LlZ!!!

296
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,635
Let's go home!

297
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,671
Hey! What do you know! It's our kids!

298
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,911
Keesha, what are you doing here?.

299
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,635
Ralphie, I know that guilty look. What's going on?.

300
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,678
uh, heh, nothing, Mom. Really!

301
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:31,595
Oh, l'm sure they were just ¡®hanging
around'.(giggle) Right, Ralphie?.

302
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,638
Right, Ms Frizzle! And bat's all!!

303
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,713
Is it the magic school bus?.

304
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,710
Is it the magic school bus?.

305
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,755
The magic school bus?.

306
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,034
Is it the magic school bus?.

307
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,269
Is it the magic school bus?.

308
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,078
The magic school bus?.

309
00:21:55,160 --> 00:22:00,917
The magic school bus?.

310
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,269
Good evening.

311
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,430
uh... is this the Magic School Bus?.

312
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,513
You found us. We're just wrapping up things here
at the castle.

313
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,318
I'm the producer - how can I help you?.

314
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,358
Cool! I have some questions about your show on
¡®Bats'.

315
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,919
I'm hung up on a few things.

316
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,673
You're not the only one. What's on your mind?.

317
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,314
First of all, if vampires AREN'T real -

318
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,312
how come everyone's always talking about them
and putting them in books,

319
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,118
movies and TV shows like yours?.

320
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,509
Because the idea of vampires is scary.

321
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,751
And people like to be scared by make-believe
monsters.

322
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:43,231
Okay. Next question. How come there was only
one kind of bat on your show?.

323
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,390
There are almost 1,000 different kinds, you
know?.

324
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,917
You're right, more than almost any other kind of
mammal. And they live all over the world.

325
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:55,234
And though most of them eat insects, some eat
pollen, nectar, fruit, frogs, fish,

326
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,154
other bats...and even lizards! Bet no one told Liz
that, huh?.!

327
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:02,869
uh, well, those kinds of bats were banned from
the set.

328
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,520
And we had very tight security.

329
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,669
Another thing.

330
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,469
The only bat sounds we can hear are the
squeaks bats make when they communicate.

331
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,518
And we really can't hear the sounds bats use to
echolocate -

332
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,511
they're too high-pitched for us to hear.

333
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,397
Hey, give us a break.

334
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,311
You know, if we didn't use a little movie magic

335
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,470
you wouldn't have understood how they worked.

336
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,709
Okay, l'll give you that one.

337
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,791
But here's something I don't think you wanted to
mention.

338
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,553
There ARE three kinds of bats who DO feed on
blood!

339
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,359
Yes, but they're only called vampire bats

340
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,716
because the people who named them had heard
make believe vampire stories.

341
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,837
Not only that, vampire bats don't even suck
blood.

342
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:40,071
They make a tiny cut in the animal, and lap up
the blood that comes out.

343
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,993
uh, well that's true. But bats don't really bother
people.

344
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,833
How come you know so much about bats,
anyway?.

345
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,512
Vell, vat do you tink?.

346
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,229
You're za only vons who know anyting about za
creatures of za night?.

347
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,789
I'm just kidding! Did I scare you?.

348
00:23:55,240 --> 00:24:00,473
Who me?. Oh, no. TV producers don't fall for that
kind of stuff.

349
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,312
Thanks for calling.
