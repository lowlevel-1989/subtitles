1
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,392
Thirty seconds and counting!

2
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,393
Twenty-nine...twenty-eight...everything in place,
Arnold?.

3
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,118
Checked and double-checked, Wanda.

4
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,113
The Double-Trouble Wheel of Wonder is ready to
roll!

5
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,428
So are we, Arnold!

6
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,398
We've already sold 689 tickets!

7
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,790
And we just gave the money to the benefit for the
animal shelter!

8
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,996
That's just for openers, Feeb!

9
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,878
We're gonna be the hottest ticket at the carnival!

10
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,037
Crowd control in place!

11
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:48,592
Stand by to be energized. Three...two...one!

12
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,318
IT'S SHOWTlME!

13
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,396
What happened?.

14
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,149
Everyone's powered up but us?....Arnold?.

15
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,630
Don't look at me, I'm chairperson of the Safety
Committee.

16
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,871
Okay, so who's the chairperson of the
Power-lt-Up Committee?.!

17
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,633
Ah...you are, Carlos.

18
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,472
CAR-LOS!

19
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,675
Is it just me,

20
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,320
or does it take ELECTRlCAL ENERGY to run a
Ferris Wheel?.

21
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:39,509
Well... Hey, don't blow a fuse! All I gotta do is
plug it in.

22
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,758
Gonna give it the goose,

23
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,114
when I plug in the juice!

24
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,192
Here goes!

25
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,394
YOW! OH NO! It shorted out!

26
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,993
Snap out of it, guys!

27
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,311
We gotta get this wheel moving before the ticket
holders get hopping mad!

28
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,153
Don't know about mad -

29
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,835
but I'm HOPPlNG up and down to ride the
Double-Trouble Wheel of Wonder!

30
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,319
Ms Frizzle!

31
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,836
We need your help, Ms Frizzle.

32
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,753
I LEAP at the opportunity!

33
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,355
Plug me into the problem, Carlos.

34
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,876
That lS the problem, Ms Frizzle. No electricity!

35
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,679
We hooked up the cable and it went kablooey!

36
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,990
No energy - no motion.

37
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,672
No rides on the Ferris Wheel.

38
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,796
And that was the last cable, too!

39
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,635
No need to get hectic over electric!

40
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,393
It's not the ONLY source of ENERGY!

41
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,595
IT'S NOT?????.

42
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,114
Nope, the world's full of energy.

43
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,875
You just have to find it - harness it - and put it to
work for you.

44
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,030
Find it?. Harness it?. Put it to work?. We don't
have time!

45
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,715
Sounds like we need an eXpert! Hey, Mikey!
Come in!

46
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,234
GASP!!! NOT MlKEY!!!

47
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,594
Last time your little brother

48
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,432
helped out we really got burned!

49
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,557
Okay, so we took a ride through my Seer

50
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,790
¡®Em & Sizzle ¡®Em Marshmallow Smoker'.

51
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,077
But you must admit, those marshmallows were
certainly tasty!

52
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,152
Yeah, and I had a heat rash for days!

53
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,869
I'd rather turn this thing by hand than ask Mikey
for help!

54
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,471
That's it! MANpower!

55
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,552
Don't you mean, PERSON power, Ralphie?.

56
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,633
Whatever, Phoebe. Come on, guys uh... people,
let's crank it up!

57
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,794
TURN!

58
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,515
Whew! This is hard!

59
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,673
What a ride! We could probably

60
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,194
go around at least once by sunset!

61
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,840
Come on, Carlos, this is serious!

62
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,992
We need energy to move this thing - not jokes!

63
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,756
If we don't get it moving soon...

64
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,950
...we'll have to call the riot police!

65
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,554
I suppose we COULD refund their money.

66
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:08,236
We can't do that! What about all those poor,
helpless animals at the shelter?.

67
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,514
What about them?.

68
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,273
Phoebe's right. We can't let them down.

69
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,112
Call Mikey.

70
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,871
It's really just a matter of delivering

71
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,235
the right amount of energy to the right spot.

72
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,992
Mikey! Come in Mikey!

73
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,036
Hang on a sec!!

74
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,111
...Yo Carlos! What's up?.

75
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,760
The Wheel of Wonder is grounded!

76
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,832
I plugged it in and it went kablooey.

77
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:36,357
No problem, bro. There's a big world out there
loaded with energy.

78
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,998
All we gotta do is find it!

79
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,514
I couldn't have said it better myself!

80
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,909
Clear the runway, I'm on my way!

81
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,788
So what was that about deliverin' the right energy
to the right spot?.

82
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:52,557
Well... Iet me put it this way, my friend, it's when
motion... makes commotion!

83
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,838
OH NO!!! Gang way!

84
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,840
Hey, that might work!

85
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,630
Whoa! That falling rock turned the Ferris wheel!

86
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,675
You got it! EXCUSE ME!

87
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,596
And if the energy of one falling rock can turn it
once -

88
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,194
imagine what a whole BUNCH of rocks could do!

89
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,429
YO MlKEY!!

90
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,670
At your service and ready to roll!

91
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,316
Hey, Dorothy Ann,

92
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,868
glad to see you got rid of that rash.

93
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,193
EXcuse me, but as head of the Safety Committee,

94
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,840
I don't think falling rocks are a safe thing to use.

95
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,957
Got it covered, Arn! The rocks will fall into one
set of seats

96
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,758
while the people ride in the other!

97
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,796
Why didn't I think of that?.

98
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,351
Yeah, when I was Mikey's age, I was still doing
weight and volume in the sandboX.

99
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,715
Let's go rock hunting, you guys!!

100
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,236
But what about the crowd?. They're getting
restless.

101
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,317
Somebody has to stay here and make sure

102
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,516
they don't tear down the Ferris Wheel next!

103
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,033
Who's gonna do that?.

104
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,235
How 'bout you?.

105
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:19,029
Uh! Wait a minute... hold it a second--

106
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,959
O. K. Class! Let's rock ¡®n roll!!

107
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,148
But, I'm just one kid. What can I do?.

108
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,639
Wing it, Carlos!

109
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,356
May the rocks be with you soon, Carlos. Buckle
up everyone.

110
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,310
OK, Ms Frizzle! It's rock power we're after.

111
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,552
We want to find it - harness it - and put it to work!

112
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,713
Whatever MOVES you, Mikey! Bus...do your
stuff!

113
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,629
Boulders! Gazillions of them!

114
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,590
All we gotta do now is get ¡®em to the top of the
mountain!

115
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,150
How?. Carry ¡®em one by one - then drop ¡®em on
the Ferris Wheel?.

116
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,312
Speaking of dropping, that's not a bad idea,
Ralphie!

117
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,756
Take chances. Make mistakes.

118
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,719
Get messy!

119
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,235
The Friz thinks of everything!

120
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,471
Don't you think she could have warned us we
were going to eject?.

121
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,869
I heard that Arnold! Now look out below!

122
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,951
Prepare for landing!

123
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,953
YEAH!

124
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,951
Catch you later, class!

125
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,595
Knock knock.

126
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,590
Who's there?.

127
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,556
No fair.

128
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,039
No fair who?.

129
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,112
No Ferris Wheel yet! Ha Ha.

130
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,198
Mikey! Do you copy?. Over!

131
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,429
Ten-four!

132
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,078
Where are those rocks?.

133
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,878
We're workin' on it!

134
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,794
According to my research, oof!, at the rate we're
going -

135
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,793
we should have enough rocks, at the top of the
mountain

136
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,708
by the time I'm sixty-two!

137
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,869
DA's right.

138
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,473
We'll NEVER get enough rocks

139
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,630
to the top of that mountain to power the Ferris
Wheel!

140
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,109
There must be another way!

141
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,070
Ralphie! You chipped it!

142
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,549
They're ROCKS, Arnold, not antiques!

143
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,950
Do something, Mikey. I'm outta jokes and blowin'
hot air!

144
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,349
It's blowin' pretty good here, too!

145
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,549
MY CAP! COME BACK HERE!

146
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:07,119
Hey, if the wind has enough energy to move
Ralphie's cap like that -

147
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,430
maybe it could move these rocks!

148
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,117
Yeah, right, Phoebe. Like the wind is going to
BLOW the rocks up the mountain?.

149
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:19,153
Not a bad idea, Keesha! Ever heard of a
windmill?.

150
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,754
The wind turns the blade of the windmill...

151
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,751
that turns a drum...

152
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,751
which moves a conveyor belt...

153
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,717
that carries the rocks up the mountain...

154
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,552
and drops them on the Ferris Wheel!

155
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,918
Wow, I have to hand it to you, Mikey. This is a
pretty cool idea!

156
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,911
Can I have my belt back, now?.

157
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:43,068
Is it just me, or do we have a little size problem
here?.

158
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,232
Yeah, WHERE are we going to get a windmill big
enough

159
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,959
to move BOULDERS to the top of the mountain?.

160
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,798
As I always say,

161
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,440
where there's a will - there's a windmill!

162
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,913
How far can a dog run into the forest?.

163
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,274
HOW FAR!!!!

164
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,558
Half way! After that, he's running out!(he
FORCES a LAUGH)

165
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,752
Any luck, Liz?.

166
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,391
I didn't think so.

167
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,758
I think the wind is just right, Ms Frizzle!

168
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,673
Then capture it and put it to work, Mikey!

169
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,239
Ready, guys?.

170
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,873
READY!

171
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,671
I don't know, Mikey. I still don't think it's gonna
work.

172
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,959
Hang onto your sombrero, Ralphie. Here she
BLOWS!

173
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,275
Hey! We're moving!

174
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,032
IT'S WORKlNG!

175
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,872
Well, what do you think, Ralphie?.

176
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:54,159
I think moving rocks is a breeze especially when
the wind is doing all the work!

177
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,390
Let's hear it for wind energy!

178
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,870
It's taking us AND the rocks right up the
mountain!

179
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:05,069
And into the RlVER!!!

180
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,154
I just ate!!

181
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:22,075
As the Friz would say... it never hurts to be
prepared!

182
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,719
MlKEY!

183
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,030
HELP!! SAVE US!

184
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,917
Hang on, you guys!!!

185
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,673
Way to go, Mikey!

186
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,476
You saved us!

187
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,276
Awright!

188
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,477
Hold it a second! WE may not be in the water

189
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,278
- but the ROCKS are!

190
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,272
Yeah! How do we get them up the mountain
now?.!

191
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,354
Hey, gimme a break! We harnessed enough
energy to get them this far didn't we?.

192
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,032
But what about that!

193
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,596
RAPlDS!!!

194
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,113
What a ride! Surf city!

195
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,397
I never realized water had so much energy.

196
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,756
Hey! If water has the energy to move US -

197
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,796
maybe we can harness it to move the ROCKS!

198
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:16,158
Ralphie, how are we going to do that?. Water
can't go UP hill!

199
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,071
But rocks CAN!

200
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,914
See what the water did to our raft?.

201
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,315
It looks like a paddlewheel!

202
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:32,078
EXactly!! It seems to me, if we hooked some kind
of stick to the paddlewheel--

203
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,709
And, and connected a spoon thingy to the
OTHER end of the stick--

204
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,553
Yeah! So when the spoon thingy gets bent by
the paddlewheel...

205
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:43,589
and the rocks fall in it SLlNGS 'em up the
mountain! KAPOWlE!

206
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,079
As the Friz would say,

207
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,550
it's time to take chances - get messy and...

208
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,190
where is Ms Frizzle, anyway?.

209
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:57,833
Hi ho!! One water-driven rock-a-pult for your
eXamination!

210
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,195
Batteries not needed - some assembly required!

211
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,432
Is this water-wheel actually going to get the rocks
up the mountain, Ms Frizzle?.

212
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,353
There's no power like water power, Arnold!

213
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,159
Water energy to the rescue!

214
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,193
AY!

215
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,072
I guess I owe you one, Mikey.

216
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,197
I really didn't think there was enough energy in
the water

217
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,078
to push these paddles hard enough to turn the
waterwheel...

218
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,436
so it could flip the catapult and fire a rock!

219
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,951
Making us the rock-toting champions of the
world! Right, guys?.

220
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,393
YEAH!

221
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:51,599
Huh oh! I think we yeahed to soon. It looks like
the tension bar's jammed!

222
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,831
I think you're right, Ralphie. See if you can re-set
it.

223
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,753
Uh...isn't there anything else we can do?.

224
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:02,231
Never mind, Ralphie. I'll do it! What could
possibly happen?.

225
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,833
Careful, Wanda!

226
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,956
Just give it a little tug to the left.

227
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,508
No sweat, Mikey - I've got it covered!

228
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,558
C'mon Ralphie! Help me out here!

229
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,392
Ralphie, come BACK!!!

230
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,552
RAL-PHlE!!!

231
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:31,878
WHOA!!! I think I'm gonna be sick!!!

232
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,636
Good aim, Ralphie!

233
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,515
What now?.

234
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,068
Wind and water energy only got the rocks to
here...

235
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,593
and we need them up THERE!

236
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,399
AND, unless we think of another source of
energy,

237
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,552
we'll NEVER get our Ferris Wheel turning - which
means

238
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,279
we'll have to take the money back from the
animal shelter.

239
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,194
Maybe we should've called it the Double-Trouble
Wheel of Blunder!

240
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,032
Bad one, Ralphie!

241
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,396
You think YOU'RE depressed, think about our
customers.

242
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,994
Why?. Because they can't ride the ferris wheel?.

243
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,150
No, because Carlos has probably

244
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,674
started doing his impressions by now!

245
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:27,629
Listen up, people! You will ride the Wheel of
Wonder when I say it is time!

246
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:32,077
We wanna ride!

247
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,037
I'll be back!

248
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,918
Whoa! Big pile of batteries!! How's it going Liz?.

249
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,634
Ms. Frizzle to Carlos. Over.

250
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,150
Things are heating up, Ms Frizzle.

251
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,753
You better do something quick!

252
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,638
We're working on it, Carlos. Ten-four!

253
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,358
Well class... Anybody have any HOT ideas:.

254
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,557
Carlos said the crowd is really getting STEAMED!

255
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,511
Speaking of steamed, I'm BOlLlNG!

256
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,990
Yeah, me, too! The sun is roasting me.

257
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,914
Wait a second!

258
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,958
If we used wind and water energy to move the
rocks,

259
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,395
maybe we can move them by using...

260
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,593
SOLAR ENERGY!!!

261
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:32,549
YEAH! But how?. Hmmm... I got it!

262
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,548
Yeah! Let's do it!!!

263
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,836
If we can get enough of the sun's energy to a
canteen,

264
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,150
the water will boil, and--

265
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,552
I know, I know! The water will boil, build up
steam inside...

266
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,914
Yeah, we're cookin', now!

267
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,434
That steam'll build up enough energy to LAUNCH
a ROCKET!

268
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,159
I mean, a ROCK, Ralphie, a rock!

269
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,951
It works!!

270
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:16,789
They'll be comin' over the mountain when they
come...

271
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,676
Man, talk about too little too late!

272
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,515
You design ¡®em, we deliver ¡®em!

273
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,720
One solar-powered, steam-driven,
rock-launcher...at your service!

274
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,436
YAY!!!

275
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,711
GET BACK! BACK, I TELL¡®YA,

276
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,872
OR l'LL DO MY ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER
lMPRESSlON AGAlN!

277
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,155
MlKEY! GET ME OUT OF HERE!

278
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,151
Got it covered, Carlos!

279
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,360
ENERGY TO THE RESCUE!

280
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,508
Ok guys...Iet's get those rocks moving!

281
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,670
The wind's blowing and the rocks are rolling...

282
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,829
Water's flowing.

283
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,197
CatapuIt's throwing!

284
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,232
The sun is shining!

285
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,277
Yikes! It's boiling!

286
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,554
Pressure's right, Mikey!

287
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,152
Time to rock and roll! MS FRlZZLE!

288
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,678
HlT lT KEESHA!

289
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,956
Rocks away!

290
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,636
MlKEY! MlKEY!

291
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,711
What happened, Carlos?.

292
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,598
I think you found a new source of energy.

293
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,954
What's that?.

294
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,953
MlKEY-POWER!!! YEEEAAY!!!

295
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,990
Calm down, folks. No pushing. We'll be here all
day.

296
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:33,153
Everyone gets a chance to ride the
Double-Trouble Wheel of Wonder.

297
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,073
SiX-ninety-eight...siX-ninety-nine...

298
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,948
we sold seven hundred more tickets for the
shelter!

299
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,792
And they're still comin', Feeb!

300
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,111
We're customerized - revitalized - and
ENERGlZED!

301
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,877
Hi, Ms Frizzle! Hi, Mikey!

302
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,471
Your wind-powered, water-powered,

303
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:55,678
solar-powered system is in full operation, Mikey.
Rock solid!

304
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,876
Looks that way, Ms Frizzle.

305
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,637
Wind energy harnessed, moving the rocks
smartly up the mountain! Ten-four!

306
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:09,436
Water energy captured, tossing the rocks toward
the top! Ten-four!

307
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,350
Solar energy making steam!!

308
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,270
We couldn't have done it without you, Mikey!!

309
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,157
Ah, it was nothin', Ms Frizzle.

310
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,360
Nothing but your endless energy and the power
of your imagination!

311
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,989
Is it the magic school bus?.

312
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,195
Is it the magic school bus?.

313
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,269
The magic school bus?.

314
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,554
Is it the magic school bus?.

315
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,436
Is it the magic school bus?.

316
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,636
The magic school bus?.

317
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:00,477
The magic school bus?.

318
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,191
Magic School Bus - the Producer here.

319
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:18,068
Just the person I wanted! I'm from the SPCR.

320
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,559
What's the SPCR?.

321
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:23,553
The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
REALlTY!

322
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,993
Uh oh.

323
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:30,200
I mean, running a Ferris Wheel with falling rocks?.
That's ridiculous!

324
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:33,397
Uh. True, machines that run on the energy of
falling rocks

325
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,118
probably aren't a good idea.

326
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,997
If your dishwasher ran on falling rocks,

327
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,991
ou might not have many dishes.

328
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:43,951
So why didn't the kids just use wind power - or
water power -

329
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,759
or solar power directly to run the Ferris Wheel?.

330
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,829
Because the wind

331
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:51,230
water and solar energy they needed was on the
other side of the mountain.

332
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,515
So they used that energy to move the rocks

333
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,352
so the rocks could move the Ferris Wheel.

334
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,190
Are you saying

335
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:00,432
there wasn't enough wind, water or solar energy
where the Ferris Wheel was?.

336
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,717
EXactly. There are lots of different sources of
energy,

337
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:07,031
but unless you can harness them - and move the
energy to your machine -

338
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,109
you can't use it.

339
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:12,079
Seems to me moving energy can be dangerous
and shouldn't be done carelessly.

340
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,476
That's a good point. Energy is powerful -

341
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,154
and power can be dangerous if you don't know
how to use it.

342
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,433
Okay, that's cool,

343
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:24,991
and the SPCR doesn't mind a little reality-bashing
in the name of education -

344
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,036
but there ARE limits!

345
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,078
Go ahead, I'm sitting down. What's the problem?.

346
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,197
You really eXpect us to believe that

347
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:36,398
Mikey had the power to actually knock the bell
clear OFF the hammer-slammer?.!

348
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,029
Listen, just between us,

349
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,954
we had a story conference about that and it was
Ms Frizzle's idea.

350
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,996
You mean Ms Frizzle is REAL?.

351
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:51,790
Well, she does have her moments. But you didn't
hear it from me, okay?.

352
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,393
Thanks for calling! Bye!!
