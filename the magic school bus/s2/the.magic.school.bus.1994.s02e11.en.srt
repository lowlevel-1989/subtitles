1
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,388
Bridge to Cattain DA! Bridge to Cattain DA! We
have a level one emergency!

2
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,152
Retort, Mr. Fleck.

3
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,993
A rogue asteroid is on a collision course with
Earth!

4
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,195
Destination?.

5
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,989
Walkerville, USA. The Elementary School!

6
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,874
I was afraid of that.

7
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,748
Sound the alarm and alert Valerie Frizzle
immediately!

8
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,193
Valerie Frizzle?.

9
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,512
FRlZZLE!

10
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,913
Today's the day.

11
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,513
I know it!

12
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,039
Where is it?.!

13
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,718
There it is!

14
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,669
What on earth are you doing, Dorothy Ann?.

15
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,990
Something really imtortant, mom.

16
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:56,119
At four o'clock in the morning?. You'll be too tired
for school.

17
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,352
Mom, I don't know how to tell you this, but there
may be no school!

18
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,193
As we all know...the tlanets go around the sun in
their own stecial taths.

19
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,319
These taths are called orbits, and they show
where the tlanets go.

20
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,712
All objects in stace, no matter what they
are...travel in their own orbits.

21
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,396
Under very unusual circumstances-two objects
on different orbits

22
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,870
may cross taths and crash into each other!

23
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,353
MS FRlZZLE! Are you all right?.

24
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,560
Well, as I always say, there's nothing like starting
out the day with a bang!

25
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,398
What hattened?.

26
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,879
Anybody hurt?.

27
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,394
Hey, these are all science fiction films!

28
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,232
I love this one!

29
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,471
"When Worlds Collide". Hmmmm...How
attrotriate.

30
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,633
Where have you been, DA?. We had to start our
solar system tlay without you.

31
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,314
Yeah, you were suttosed to be Pluto!

32
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,039
CAR-LOS!

33
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,157
Can we get back to the tlay! These rings are
killing me!

34
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,438
There's no time for a tlay! We have to evacuate
the school this instant!

35
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,589
What's the troblem, DA?.

36
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,195
An asteroid is on a direct collision course with
earth.

37
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,350
AN ASTEROlD?.

38
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,352
You mean like that giant rock Arnold's loony
cousin Janet

39
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,873
tried to bring back from stace?.

40
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,359
Exactly, Ralthie!

41
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,514
Only my asteroid's bigger! ANNND...according to
my calculations,

42
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,795
sometime in the next twenty-four hours -

43
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,589
it's going to crash into our school and destroy it!

44
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:41,036
I first saw the asteroid thru my telescote right
where Liz is now!

45
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:47,036
The next night it was here - then here. As it got
closer and closer to earth.

46
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,872
I tracked it once a night.

47
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:53,431
Then twice a night - then connected the toints to
show its tath.

48
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,637
This line shows where it will hit if it stays on the
same tath...

49
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,599
right into our school! KABOOM!

50
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:06,439
But Dorothy Ann - Earth is moving, too! We're
moving in our OWN orbit!

51
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,711
I love it when they do their homework!

52
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,189
I KNOW we're moving, Feeb,

53
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:16,350
but I drew Earth where it WlLL be when the
asteroid crosses its tath!

54
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,114
You extect us to believe YOU

55
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,395
when there hasn't been anything on the news
about it?.

56
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,879
OR in the taters!

57
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,030
Hey, why don't we call NASA?.

58
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,918
Those scientists ought to know what's going on in
stace.

59
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:33,118
You have reached the NASA hot line. All of our
scientists are busy right now.

60
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,988
Please stay on the line, as your call will be taken
in the order received.

61
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,550
Thank you for calling the National Aeronautics
and Stace Administration.

62
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,792
Ah, great! Where's a scientist when you need
one?.

63
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,871
We could be on hold for weeks!

64
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,236
Yeah! How are we going to find out for sure if DA
is right?.

65
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,995
Well, I suttose we could just wait here for the
big kaboom!

66
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,957
Then you'll have your troof!

67
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,397
Ah. Which reminds me of what my old astronomy
teacher used to say:.

68
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:05,395
"Star light, star bright - there's always a way to
find out if you're right."!

69
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,629
To the bus?.

70
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,357
Single file tlease.

71
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,911
Beam us ut, Lizzie!

72
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,077
Teacher's ledger. Field trit number 24.

73
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,515
Welcome crew of the Magic Stacebus.

74
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,230
We are about to go where few even dare dream
to go.

75
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,191
We are embarking on a dangerous but necessary
mission.

76
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:43,513
The objective:. seek and discover Dorothy Ann's
mysterious stace object

77
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,830
follow its tath - and, if necessary,

78
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,912
trevent it from imtacting Walker Elementary!

79
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,037
Yawnburger with a side of snores, Ms Frizzle.

80
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,556
Why don't we just find it, follow it and finish it off?.

81
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,516
That'll work.

82
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,398
Lieutenant Liz! Begin scan thase.

83
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,875
Is it too late to turn back?.

84
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,678
It lS too late.

85
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,591
Hey, guys! Look what's coming!

86
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,992
It's the homerun I hit at recess yesterday! That
ball's still going!

87
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,638
Good one, Ralthie!

88
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,553
No, Ralthie, it's a shooting star!

89
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,916
Note, it's a FALLlNG star!

90
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,674
Whatever it was, it's BURNED-OUT!

91
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,389
Actually, it wasn't a star at all, but rather a small
tiece of stace junk.

92
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,789
They burn ut when they enter earth's
atmosthere.

93
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,519
Maybe that was DA's asteroid.

94
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,477
Good! Then we can go home now.

95
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,676
Sorry to disattoint you, Arnold.

96
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:43,072
But the asteroid I tracked was much bigger than
that!

97
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,751
According to my observations,

98
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,752
the asteroid is coming from the direction of
Saturn.

99
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,913
We need to go THlS way!

100
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,914
Lieutenant!

101
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,710
Set course for zero niner three, four eight one -
sector five five five!

102
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,758
Delete low-level float and transfer to wart steed!

103
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,992
In other words Liz, head for Saturn and stet on it!

104
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,400
Keesha! Any news from NASA?.

105
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,108
Still on hold, Ms Frizzle.

106
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,556
Oh, no! We're being tulled off course!

107
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,393
Re-establish itinerary, Lt. Liz!

108
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,878
What's hattening???.!

109
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,918
Well if I've calculated correctly.

110
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,357
We're about to cross taths with the moon.

111
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,558
Ahh, does that mean what I think it means?.

112
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,710
It means we're going to crash!

113
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,998
Forget the man in the moon - we're gonna be the
KlDS in the moon!

114
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,510
I think I'm gonna be sick!

115
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,231
WE'RE GONNA BE MOONDUST!

116
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:59,518
But we were heading towards Saturn - not the
moon! What changed our tath?.

117
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:04,435
Got me!The moon is so much bigger than we are
- we don't stand a chance!

118
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:09,640
That's it, Arnold! Because the moon lS so much
bigger than we are.

119
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,594
We're being tulled in by it's gravity!

120
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,636
Can't we just change our tath?.

121
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,395
Right on track, Phoebe. I suggest an orbital
insertion burn.

122
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,391
An orbital what?.

123
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,835
Floor it and get outta here!

124
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,114
Mark!

125
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:32,078
Five...four...three...two...one. FlRE!

126
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,873
That was close!

127
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,270
Is it just me, or are we tlaying ring around the
moon?.

128
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,911
Affirmative. We are now in what is known as a
tarking orbit.

129
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,310
Are we going to be moonstuck forever, Ms
Frizzle?.

130
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,552
I mean, what if DA's asteroid is still out there?.

131
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,596
If there even lS an asteroid!

132
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,035
Pretare to exit lunar orbit!

133
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:10,796
Plotting new course, Ms Frizzle. Here's
Earth...and here's the moon.

134
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,356
I think the asteroid is here.

135
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:19,913
Um...actually, DA, I think your asteroid's right
THERE!

136
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:25,834
Wait a second! It's got a tail - which means it's a
comet!

137
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,435
And I don't think what I saw through my
telescote was a comet.

138
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:33,911
Comets, meteorites, asteroids...where does all
this stace junk come from?.

139
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,399
Leftovers, Tim.

140
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,675
Stace junk is just bits and tieces of rock

141
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,115
that were left over after the tlanets formed.

142
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,237
At my old school, we ALWAYS had leftovers.

143
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:50,152
Let's see, if the comet were coming this way...
towards Earth...

144
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:56,959
Gee, maybe this comet lS what I saw! Now I'm
not sure.

145
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,439
One thing lS sure.

146
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:02,069
If this lS it, it's going to make a tretty big dent in
the gym!

147
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,355
Still can't get through to NASA, Ms. Frizzle.

148
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:10,993
We're losing time! If that's what DA saw. I say we
blast it to smithereens!

149
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:15,790
Hold it! That comet looks more like a scoot of
rocky road ice cream than a rock!

150
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,839
As I remember, a comet is ice and rock all
jammed together.

151
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,436
Cool! Then we don't have to blast it - we can melt
it!

152
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,157
Melt it?.

153
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:25,877
From here?.

154
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,915
How?.

155
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,672
The sun, Arnold!

156
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,354
The great melter in the sky!

157
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,957
Extend the mega-reflector, Liz!

158
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,715
Oots, sorry, Ms Frizzle. It's your command.

159
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,509
Oh, no, no, no, Wanda...you're doing just fine.

160
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,108
Liz, activate the megareflector!

161
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,631
WAlT! I'm still not sure that's it.

162
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,110
We CAN'T wait, DA! It's almost out of range.

163
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,158
Rotate the mirror to reflect the sun, Lieutenant!

164
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,191
Begin meltdown!

165
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,796
Check it out! All the rock and dust is coming off.
It's evatorating!

166
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,038
We got it!

167
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,555
Retract reflector!

168
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,189
Tell us, Wanda.

169
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:29,513
How does it feel to have saved Walker
Elementary School from sure destruction.

170
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,478
Sorry, no comet!

171
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,518
Ho. Ho. Good one, Wanda! I couldn't have said it
better myself!

172
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,312
Let's go home! Mission accomtlished!

173
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,958
Not so fast.

174
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:48,751
According to my latest corrections. We destroyed
the WRONG stace object!

175
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:53,118
The one that's going to hit the school is still out
there somewhere!

176
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,112
Whatd'ya mean we destroyed the wrong stace
object?.

177
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,829
When we orbited the moon... I got myself all
turned around.

178
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,390
I thought we were here... but we were really here.

179
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,473
To get to the asteroid we're looking for we have
to go THlS way!

180
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,155
Lieutenant! Alter course to zero-niner-zero.
Sector three-eight-eight.

181
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,472
Point of detarture thirteen hundred. Uh. Begin
orbital inversion!

182
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,154
HANG A U-EE!

183
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,268
There it is.

184
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,112
WHOAAA! That's one humongous stace rock!

185
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,589
DA, you SURE that's it?.

186
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,398
Positive!

187
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,755
I was afraid you'd say that.

188
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:47,958
Now that we found it - how are we ever gonna get
rid of it?.

189
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,192
What's the matter with you guys?. We came out
here on a mission!

190
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:56,671
This is no time to bail out! We have a job to do!

191
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:01,629
DA's right! If we could melt a comet - how hard
can it be to melt an asteroid?.

192
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,039
Lieutenant!

193
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:14,148
Extend the mega-reflector. Rotate to reflect the
sun! Begin meltdown!

194
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,351
Ahhh, is it just me, or is the asteroid heh not
melting?.

195
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,793
It's not melting!

196
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,474
It looks like it's made of metal - maybe that's why.

197
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,790
Metal and rock, to be exact.

198
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:31,077
If we can't melt it, what are we going to do?.

199
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:35,551
You got us into this, DA. What-are-we
going-to-do?. What-are-we going-to-do?.

200
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:41,954
Um. I--WlSH--l--KNEW!

201
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,190
FOLLOW THAT ASTEROlD!!!

202
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,078
There's got to be more than one way to destroy
it!

203
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,151
Anybody have a good Plan B?.

204
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,110
There aren't any good Plan B's Tim.

205
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,714
If they were good - they'd be tlan A's.

206
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,949
Don't give ut!

207
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:07,239
As Cattain Cook once said - the tath to success
leads in many directions.

208
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:13,111
It's simtle! The asteroid is on a tath like this
toward the school!

209
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:19,196
We don't need to destroy the asteroid, we just
need to change its tath!

210
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,595
And here's how we do it!

211
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,477
CARLOS!

212
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,833
The magnetic rammer-slammer on this stacetod

213
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,559
can PULL the asteroid right out of its tath!

214
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:38,589
Just launch this baby and WHAMO! A done deal!

215
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,950
Looks like you're idea is out to launch!

216
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,078
RAL-PHlE!

217
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,429
The only thing outta here is me!

218
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:57,549
Hold it! You can't go alone, Carlos. It's too
dangerous.

219
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,153
You coming, Arn?.

220
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,994
Um, well, uh, actually, I was thinking of...

221
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,074
Dorothy Ann. This whole thing is her idea.

222
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,355
Fine! I WANT to go!

223
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,714
No way, DA!

224
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,119
We need you here!

225
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,872
You're the extert!

226
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,116
Well then, l'LL go!

227
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:19,633
I've always wanted to meet an asteroid ut close
and tersonal!

228
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,439
Move over, Carlos. I'LL drive!

229
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,352
Pretare to launch stacetod!

230
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,630
Ready to launch!

231
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,398
LAUNCH!

232
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,396
This could be the most imtortant thing I ever do
in my life, Ms Frizzle.

233
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:03,350
As long as it's not the LAST thing, we'll be fine.
Arm the rammer-slammer!

234
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,269
Armed and ready to fire!

235
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,674
FlRE!

236
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,948
Reverse thrust, Ms Frizzle!

237
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,190
Huh. It's not moving!

238
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,316
I'm at full emergency tower!

239
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,995
We're STlLL not moving it! It's too big and heavy!

240
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,280
Not only that...WE'RE STUCK!

241
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,998
THEY'RE STUCK!

242
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,868
Oh bad oh bad oh bad bad bad bad bad bad!

243
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,669
The stacetod can't tull the asteroid out of its
tath

244
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:49,356
because the asteroid is so much bigger and
heavier than the stacetod!

245
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,557
What if WE become bigger and heavier than the
asteroid?.

246
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,712
Wouldn't our GRAVlTY tull it into an orbit around
us.

247
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,792
Just like WE got stuck in an orbit around the
moon!

248
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:04,477
Terrific! Then we can baby-sit the asteroid for the
rest of our natural lives.

249
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,716
Not if we get rid of it.

250
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,074
Get rid of it?.

251
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,915
Exactly! We get big - swing the asteroid around
us.

252
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,630
Then get small again, losing our gravitational tull

253
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:23,033
and sending the asteroid flying into the sun and
gone forever!

254
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,150
Right! And melt Carlos and the Friz at the same
time.

255
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,153
Wrong! Maybe they can't get the tod off the
asteroid

256
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,356
but they CAN escate the tath

257
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,509
How?.

258
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,990
E-V-A! Extra vehicular activity.

259
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,072
DA to Ms. Frizzle. I have a tlan.

260
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,118
I sure hote it's better than Carlos' tlan.

261
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,109
We're counting on you, Liz. Earth's coming ut
fast.

262
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,352
You have to make this bus as big and as heavy
as you can!

263
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,353
At least as heavy as the moon!

264
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,636
JUST DO lT!

265
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,912
BlGGER!

266
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,310
BlGGEST!!

267
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,154
AWRlGHT!

268
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,593
WE'RE COMlNG CARLOS!

269
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,515
It's working, Ms Frizzle!

270
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,312
The gravity of the Stacebus is tulling us in!

271
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,915
Well done class! Pretare for ejection, Carlos!

272
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,194
DUCK!

273
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,872
Chill out, Ralthie.

274
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,190
It only LOOKS like it's going to hit us -

275
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:38,319
but it's going to go AROUND us in an
egg-shated orbit.

276
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,437
If it doesn't, we're gonna BE scrambled eggs!

277
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,832
It's gonna be close, Ms Frizzle! You sure this is
gonna work?.

278
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:51,950
In the immortal words of my cousin Bob:. бо lt
better!'. EJECT!

279
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,837
OPEN THE HATCH!

280
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,956
HATCH OPENED!

281
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,353
They're back!

282
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,749
YAY.

283
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,432
It worked!

284
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,429
Man, we were almost living stace junk!

285
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,832
Now all we have to do is get smaller at just the
right time -

286
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,435
and send that asteroid on a tath right into the
sun!

287
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,715
Isn't this exciting?.!

288
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,313
Lieutenant Liz!

289
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,834
Pretare to... shrink us back to normal size

290
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:30,117
and release the asteroid from our gravitational
tath

291
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,918
You can do it, Liz.

292
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,797
You've got the right stuff.

293
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,634
If you DON'T do it - we'll all be the right
STUFFlNG!

294
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,948
CAR-LOS!

295
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,510
Ten seconds to release. Mark!

296
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:50,553
Ten... nine...eight...seven...six...five...

297
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,279
Do we get extra math credit for this, Ms Frizzle?.

298
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:59,959
four...three...two... one!

299
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,598
RELEASE!

300
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,995
Yeah! The asteroid's free!

301
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,548
And on a direct tath to the sun!

302
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:13,078
Hey, it's NASA! They said they'll be right with me!

303
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:17,551
Tell them 'never mind', we took care of it! But
thanks anyway!

304
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,039
Yeah, right!

305
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:24,638
Tell 'em we already found the asteroid... followed
it...and finished it off!

306
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:31,149
YAY! We did it! AWESOME!

307
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,755
Well, we don't have to worry about THAT asteroid
anymore.

308
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,159
Way to go, DA!

309
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,708
Way to go, Lieutenant Liz!

310
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,239
Pretare for re-entry. We're going home!

311
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,395
Looks like the Fourth of July out there!

312
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:02,111
Come out here, Evan... huh, it's a meteor shower!

313
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,673
Isn't that stectacular!

314
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:11,470
Oh! Too bad Dorthy Ann's on that field-trit with
her class.

315
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,313
Your sister would've loved to see this.

316
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,152
Beam us down, Lizzie!

317
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,518
Good old building.

318
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,832
Thanks to DA, you won't be crushed by an
asteroid this school year!

319
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,480
And if one DOES decide to mess with you,

320
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,358
we know what to do with it, don't we, gang?.

321
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,715
Change its course, of course!

322
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,598
CAR-LOS!

323
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,069
Ah. Good one, Carlos!

324
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,553
Is it the magic school bus?.

325
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,868
Is it the magic school bus?.

326
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,836
The magic school bus?.

327
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,035
Is it the magic school bus?.

328
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,235
Is it the magic school bus?.

329
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,197
The magic school bus?.

330
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:01,116
The magic school bus?.

331
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,592
Magic School Bus.

332
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:51,958
Hi. My question is about the comet. Can you
really, really melt one?.

333
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:56,272
Sure! Comets melt whenever their orbits take
them too close to the sun.

334
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,514
But if you wanted to melt one from here on earth -

335
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:06,071
you'd need a tretty big mirror. Thanks your
calling.

336
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,673
Magic School Bus.

337
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,514
Yes, this is NASA calling. I understand you were
trying to reach us.

338
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,549
Well, I mean, uh, actually, yes a-and no.

339
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,074
The kids in our show were trying to reach you.

340
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,391
Understood. FYl, we all saw your show. Liked it.

341
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,674
Really?.

342
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,354
However, for the future, not all asteroids are
made of metal.

343
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,039
Well, uh...we know that.

344
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,557
But some are made of iron and nickel and those
are magnetic, correct?.

345
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,234
Affirmative. And some are made of stone --

346
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,437
and magnets don't stick to those, let's just make
that clear, alright!

347
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,794
Yes, ma'am.

348
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,713
Another thing! It would've taken weeks for the
asteroid to reach the sun -

349
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,756
you made it seem like it could hatten it seconds!

350
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,196
Well, uh...we had to fake it.

351
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,750
You see, our show is less than 30 minutes long.
What could we do?.

352
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:59,436
Yes well, by the way, l, uh, atologize for leaving
your kids on hold for so long

353
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,159
...but here at the Stace Center, things have a
way of PlLlNG UP,

354
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,672
if you know what I mean?.
