1
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,719
I don't know about you, Phoeb, but I can't stand
vacations.

2
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,872
Why not?. I mean, how can you not like
vacations?.

3
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,076
¡®Cause they always end, that's why!.

4
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,158
That sounds like Keesha!

5
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,916
I've been robbed! Somebody stole my cucumber!

6
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,672
Why would anyone steal a cucumber?.

7
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:34,390
Especially MY cucumber. I LOVED my cucumber.

8
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:39,474
I grew it from a teeny-weeny seed. It was a
champion.

9
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,837
At least whoever took it left you a tasty-looking
pickle.

10
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,433
I mean... Iook at my carrot!

11
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,750
Not even a starving rabbit would eat it now!

12
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,071
And my tomato doesn't even look like a tomato
anymore.

13
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,355
It would've been better off stolen.

14
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,668
I don't understand.

15
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,878
How could things so good turn so bad over one
little vacation?.

16
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,795
In the famous words of Ms Frizzle:."Time waits for
no vegetable!"

17
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,869
Let's face it, our county fair has turned into the
city dump!

18
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,075
Heyyy, gimme, five, guys! The kid's back.

19
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,149
Hi, Ralphie!

20
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,037
Hey, how¡®ya doin, Ralphie?.!

21
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,591
Whoaaa, Arnold, I haven't seen anything that
gross since my baseball glove

22
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,911
got rained on and run over by the garbage truck!

23
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:26,352
In case you forgot, Ralphie, my tomato DlD win
third place.

24
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,876
With the way that tomato looks now, my glove
could've come in second.

25
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,632
Hey... nice pickle, Keesh.

26
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:37,875
Waitaminute! Holdit! Doesn't anybody care that
somebody stole my cucumber?.!

27
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,758
Stole it?. Who'd ever do such a thing?.

28
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,274
You like cucumbers, don't you, Ralphie?.

29
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,191
Like ¡®em - I love ¡®em!

30
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:52,311
Hey... hold it a second! You're not trying to say l
stole your cucumber, are you?.

31
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,110
Good morning, class.

32
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,876
Um...isn't it awfully early to be eating a pickle, Ms
Frizzle?.

33
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,350
It's never too early for a pickle... unless it's a
cucumber.

34
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:09,037
Speaking of cucumbers, Ms Frizzle, mine was
stolen while we were on vacation.

35
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,111
We must have had a thief in here.

36
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,029
Is this what you're looking for, Keesha?.

37
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,075
This isn't my cucumber, Ms Frizzle. It's a pickle!

38
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,070
Mmmmmm!
Mmmmm... Mmmmmm... Mmmm... Mmmm... And
it's almost ready to eat.

39
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,517
Whoa! There's a TON of pickles in here!

40
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:34,199
You caught me, Ralphie. Oh! I have a private and
powerful passion for pickles!

41
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,955
Something smells funny here.

42
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,632
Your nose knows, Keesha.

43
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:44,793
Hmmm... Ummmm.... It's the salty brine the pickles
have pickled in.

44
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,758
I'm talking about my PRlZE cucumber, Ms
Frizzle.

45
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,277
And all I know is - the door to this classroom was
locked during vacation-

46
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,640
and YOU had the key!

47
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,710
KEESHA! Are you suggesting that...that Ms
Frizzle... that our beloved

48
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,313
teacher... that she...

49
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,029
Well, she COULD have done something with my
cucumber!

50
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,351
You're right, Keesha. I admit it.

51
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,998
MS FRlZZLE!

52
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,712
I admit that thanks to me your cucumber is gone
- but it isn't missing!

53
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,839
How can something be gone but not missing?.

54
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:30,314
You see, Keesha...this pickle USED to be your
cucumber. Isn't that amazing?.

55
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,791
NOT amazing and NOT possible! This does not
LOOK like my cucumber...

56
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,352
It doesn't SMELL like my cucumber

57
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,716
and I'm sure it doesn't TASTE like my cucumber.

58
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,553
STOP! You're destroying the evidence!

59
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,279
What evidence?. This isn't a trial.

60
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,679
Maybe it is.

61
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,639
My point exactly! If Keesha eats this pickle -

62
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,678
then Ms Frizzle can't prove it's Keesha's
cucumber.

63
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,153
Right, Ms Frizzle?.

64
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,117
Sounds right to me, Arnold.

65
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:04,115
I hate to do this, Ms Frizzle, but I have to ask you
some tough questions.

66
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:09,115
Ah! How exciting! As I always say, one tough
question deserves another.

67
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,556
WAlT! You don't have to answer anything, Ms
Frizzle.

68
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,596
You have the right to remain silent -

69
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,240
you even have the right to dismiss this class!

70
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,074
Why would I want to do that, Arnold?.

71
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,154
I've never been on trial before! Let the trial begin!

72
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,677
Court is now in session.

73
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,191
The case of the missing cucumber:. Keesha vs.
Ms Frizzle.

74
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,552
The honorable Judge Liz Ard presiding -

75
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,916
yours truly speaking on behalf of the Court.

76
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,156
Keesha?. Do you have an opening statement?.

77
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,392
I do. I intend to prove that Ms Frizzle not only
TOOK my prize-

78
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,758
winning cucumber, but also that she did NOT turn
it into a pickle!

79
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,112
Ohh! Bravo, Keesha! I intend to prove the same
thing!

80
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,919
It's so nice when everyone's on the same side.

81
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,268
Ms Frizzle!

82
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,192
Sit down, Arnold!

83
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,669
Kids of the jury, THlS is a pickle.

84
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,715
THlS is a cucumber Not as big as MY cucumber,

85
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,109
mind you, but still a cucumber!

86
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,315
I OBJECT!

87
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,915
What now, Arnold?.! You know that's a cucumber!

88
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,519
Okay, I take it back.

89
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,114
Ms Frizzle is asking us to believe that

90
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,033
a pickle and a cucumber are the same thing.

91
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,274
Now I ask you, do these look the same to you?. I
don't think so.

92
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,828
Does the defense have anything to say in
defense?.

93
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,469
Yes, we do! We will prove that no crime was
committed

94
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,755
and Ms Frizzle is innocent of all charges.

95
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,068
Right, Ms. Frizzle?.

96
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,197
As I already said, Arnold, I DlD take Keesha's
cucumber,

97
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,555
but I did not change it into a pickle.

98
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,393
BUT... I know who did!

99
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,119
You do?????.

100
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:00,352
They were members of a gang. A small-time gang
with big ideas.

101
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,159
A tiny, troublesome, crowd of two-bit thieves
known as...

102
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,076
the Mike ROBE Gang.

103
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,795
And even though they hang around

104
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:11,475
a lot of different places they're extremely hard to
find.

105
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,551
Is that because they're always on the run?.

106
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,552
No... it's because they're invisible!

107
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,119
INVlSlBLE?????.!

108
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,077
I think the Frizz's losing it.

109
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,355
Order, order in the court!

110
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,109
OBJECTlON! Ms Frizzle is NOT losing it!

111
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,873
There's a perfectly logical explanation.

112
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,029
Tell them, Ms Frizzle.

113
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,875
Tell them the gang is invisible because they wear
disguises, right?.

114
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,075
Oh, no!

115
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,153
They're invisible because they're too small to be
seen with the naked eye -

116
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,872
yet every second of every day, they're busy
changing the very world we live in!

117
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,679
Ms Frizzle! You're not making this very easy.

118
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:53,072
I agree! How can Ms Frizzle expect us to believe
that my cucumber

119
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,470
was turned into a pickle by a gang of thieves we
can't even see???.!

120
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,439
Keesha has a point, Arnold. How CAN you prove
that?.

121
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,589
Oh, Arnold....

122
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,920
We're taking the court on a field trip!

123
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,238
A field trip?.!

124
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,436
What am I saying?????.

125
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,192
It's the only way, Arnold.

126
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,513
If you say so, Ms Frizzle. Everyone to the bus!

127
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,114
Kids of the jury,

128
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,636
this field trip will prove to you that Ms Frizzle is
telling the truth.

129
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:30,032
It will show you that the members of the Mike
ROBE Gang really exist.

130
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,997
You will see with your own eyes that

131
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,197
they have the ability to turn a cucumber into a
pickle!

132
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,919
YAAAAAAY!!!

133
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,910
I OBJECT!

134
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,788
There shouldn't be any applauding until AFTER
we see this lNVlSlBLE gang...

135
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,835
IF they exist

136
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:49,517
which I doubt! I mean, come on, how can you see
something if it's invisible?.!

137
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,750
As Sherlock Gherkin once said,

138
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,469
cucumber thieves always return to the scene of
the brine!

139
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:01,276
Buckle up, everyone! Bus, do your stuff!

140
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,911
This is really weird!

141
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,713
Nothing like a little shrinking to get you thinking!

142
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,994
Hey, what's that!

143
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,435
Yeah, but last week you were BlGGER than your
comb!

144
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,234
Now your comb's bigger than ALL of us!

145
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,790
Um...excuse me, Ms Frizzle, but does this really
count as a field trip?.

146
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,916
I mean, we haven't gone anywhere!

147
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,554
Technically, we're still in our classroom.

148
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,668
Here's the button to my favorite blouse! Oh! I
knew I'd find it!

149
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,036
That's it!We're inside the lost and found box!

150
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,519
Hey, look at this!

151
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,036
I never knew Lincoln was inside this building!
How'ya doin', Abe?.

152
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,754
Got it!

153
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,676
LlFT!

154
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,550
Phew! Thanks.

155
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,471
Good thing it wasn't a quarter!

156
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,475
Okay, okay, so we're really small. What does that
prove?.

157
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:17,439
It proves that when you're small you can see
things you never saw before!

158
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,112
Like this spidermite!

159
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,078
No way! I saw one of those BEFORE we got
small,

160
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,993
though I have to admit, it didn't look so... big!

161
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,992
Yeah, well I bet you never saw one of THESE
before!

162
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,913
Could she, Ms Frizzle?.

163
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,112
Oh! Not likely, Arnold. It's much too tiny.

164
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,157
And it's alive!

165
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,630
It's a kind of yeast called an ascomycete.

166
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,154
Yeast???.! What's yeast doing here?.

167
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,754
Ascomycete grow nearly everywhere.

168
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,719
Cool! But I'd rather find one on your seat than my
seat!

169
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,238
CAR-LOS!

170
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,151
I don't care whose seat it's on!

171
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,710
If it's so tiny you can only see it when YOU'RE
tiny -

172
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,951
that makes it an invisible member of Mike Robe's
Gang...

173
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,033
just like Ms Frizzle said! I rest my case!

174
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,750
Not so fast, Arnold. Just because there are tiny
little creatures here -

175
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,876
doesn't mean they're EVERYWHERE!

176
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,589
And it DOESN'T mean that they turned my
cucumber into a pickle!

177
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,399
Okay, Keesha, you want more proof?.

178
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,916
More evidence?. Pick a place - any place -

179
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,470
I'll show you more invisible creatures! I hope.

180
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,790
Fine! Let's go to the vegetable garden!

181
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,034
Hey, Liz...we're up here!

182
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,633
She can't see us!

183
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,915
She could if she knew where to look.

184
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,589
I changed my mind. I want to land on Liz.

185
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,229
I OBJECT! You said you wanted to go to the
vegetable garden.

186
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,677
Ah! Not to worry, Arnold. No matter where we go -
day or night -

187
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:59,356
night or day, the Mike Robe Gang will have its
say. Liz it is!

188
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,598
I don't see any creepy crawly creatures.

189
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,556
I do!

190
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,079
Ah ha! Another member of the Mike Robe Gang!
Right, Ms Frizzle?.

191
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,513
Right on, Arnold!

192
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,717
Oh, no! I think Liz thinks we're one of them!

193
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,512
I really hate it when we land upsidedown!

194
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,876
Where are we now???.!

195
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,315
I hope we're not back in the water cycle!

196
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,439
Hmmmm... Unless I'm mistaken, we're inside...

197
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,189
THE HAMSTER'S WATER BOWL!!!

198
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,032
And Liz STlLL can't find us!

199
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,075
I object!

200
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,832
What NOW, Arnold?.!

201
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,595
I object to being the smallest defense attorney in
history!

202
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,433
I object to where we are. LOOK!

203
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,239
I think we landed in the middle of a feeding
frenzy!

204
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,038
What are they???.

205
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,634
Ahh! The fat juicy ones are Amoeba -

206
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,315
and the ones that look like hairy hotdogs are
Paramecium.

207
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,278
Looks like the Underwater Wrestling Association
to me!

208
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,194
Actually, Ralphie, they're more members of the
Mike Robe Gang.

209
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,396
We're under attack!

210
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,358
Gosh, I never knew things like these existed!

211
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,638
But now you do! And not only that, they're
everywhere! Case closed!

212
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,472
Well done, Arnold.

213
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,519
OBJECTlON! Our hamster drinks this water,
right?.

214
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,592
So how can this invisible gang change my
cucumber into a pickle

215
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,434
if our hamster's still a hamster, huh?.! Explain
that!!

216
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:33,274
Well, uh, uh...it seems to me, ummmmm...

217
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,916
Okay, you want change?.! I'll show you change.

218
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,596
THERE! My tomato! Something is definitely going
on there!

219
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,797
I don't know about you guys, but I hope our
hamster isn't...

220
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,518
To my tomato, Ms Frizzle! AND HURRY!

221
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,718
Here we GOOOOO....

222
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,316
WE'RE GONNA CRASH!

223
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,835
Smooth landing, Ms Frizzle.

224
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,918
I'd rather be on Wanda's carrot!

225
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,310
Here that Keesha?. I told you something was
going on.

226
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,710
Sorry, Arnold, smelly and gushy isn't enough!

227
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,554
I don't see anything here to change my mind but
a rotten tomato!

228
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:32,714
Ummm, maybe... maybe we need to uh, uh...
shrink some more.

229
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,916
I can't believe I said that.

230
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,915
As my great aunt Chameleon used to say, there's
nothing as constant as change!

231
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,349
No sooner shrunk than sunk!

232
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,192
Yuck! Hard to believe anything would want to
hang out here.

233
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,191
Only one way to find out.

234
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:08,470
And that way is to...GET MESSY! Into your
anti-fungus suits, everyone!

235
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,758
I knew I should've stayed home today.

236
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,600
WOW! COOL!

237
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,750
Look! More members of the Mike Robe Gang!

238
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,353
They're everywhere!

239
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,037
It looks like they're attacking Arnold's tomato.

240
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,391
We're surrounded!

241
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,118
Ah! Relax, Arnold.

242
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,715
They're funguses - and they're only doing what
comes naturally.

243
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,189
You mean, they're SUPPOSED to destroy the
tomato?.

244
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,475
Hey, even a fungus has to eat.

245
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,198
WOW! COOL!

246
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,909
Hey! Watch it! Whaaaa... What if they eat us
next???.!

247
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,389
Then Ms Frizzle will need a new defense
attorney!

248
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,840
If we were big, couldn't we see this stuff
happening through a magnifying glass?.

249
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,150
Only a very powerful one, Phoebe.

250
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,310
You mean like the mega-magnifyer?.

251
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,195
Your point is a juicy one, Ms Frizzle...

252
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,716
but even though I've seen that Mike Robe's
Gangsters are everywhere

253
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,155
AND that they can make things change

254
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,756
you STlLL haven't proven that they turned my
cucumber into a pickle!

255
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:27,913
I... OB---JECT!! Just in case that calls for another
shrink.

256
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,871
That won't be necessary, Arnold.

257
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,557
Uh oh! Is it just me, or are we having a TOMATO

258
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:45,959
QUAAAAAKE!!!
HEELLLLLLLLLLLLPPPPPPPPPPPP.!.!!

259
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:58,912
Incredible! We're inside Ms. Frizzle's pickle jar!

260
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,951
This is it, Keesha. This is where it all happened.

261
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,998
You mean we're actually at the scene of the
crime?.

262
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,071
FOLLOW ME....!

263
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,234
I object!

264
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:15,596
It's too late to object, Arnold. LOOK OUT!

265
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,150
It sure is crowded in here!

266
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,434
Ugh! The tomato fungus is still among us! They're
EVERYWHERE!

267
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,876
Ah! Right you are, Wanda. Everywhere and
anywhere.

268
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,356
YYYuck! What's going on here?.!

269
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,876
More destruction! First the funguses ate the
tomato -

270
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,791
now they're trying to eat the pickle!

271
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:48,476
Looks to me like they've got some competition
from those little squirty things!

272
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,154
The little squirty things are a kind of bacteria --

273
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,789
AND THEY ARE ACTUALLY protecting THE
PlCKLE.

274
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,589
Whoa! Look at those pickle protectors work!

275
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,035
Wipe out! The funguses are history!

276
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,349
Woooch! Pickle juice!

277
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,351
I HATE pickle juice!

278
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,998
So do the funguses!

279
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,279
Hey, check it out!

280
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,033
Now the pickle bacteria are attacking the
cucmber!

281
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,476
What's happening?. I thought the picklers were
the good guys.

282
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:41,315
They are, Keesha. They're not destroying the
cucumber -- they're SAVlNG it!

283
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,312
So, if it weren't for the pickle bacteria,

284
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,039
the same rotten thing that happened to the
tomato -

285
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,917
would happen to this cucumber!

286
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,554
Yeah! Total annihilation!

287
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:56,032
I get it! The funguses rot things by eating them

288
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:00,352
and the pickle bacteria STOP things from rotting
by getting rid of the funguses!

289
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:04,592
Only one problem - the pickle bacteria's turning
the cuke into a pickle!

290
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:08,195
Ahh! Not a problem, Ralphie - that's preservation!

291
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,989
A pickle lasts a lot longer than a cucmber!

292
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,470
Don't tell me the pickle bacteria are gang
members too?.

293
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:20,236
That they are, Keesha. They may be small, but
they make big changes.

294
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,438
And all those tiny living things we've just seen are
called microbes.

295
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,511
Did you say microbes?.

296
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:31,196
As in microscopic?. So tiny that you need a
microscope to see them?.

297
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,077
So tiny that they're invisible?.!

298
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,309
Just like us!

299
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:40,312
Tiny... invisible... microscopic...YYYYESSS!!!

300
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,039
Kids of the jury, you've seen with your own eyes

301
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,590
that all around us is an invisible world of
microbes.

302
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:54,712
A world that includes Amoebas Parameciums
Ascomycetes Funguses...

303
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,395
And, yes, Pickle Bacteria!

304
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,439
And each and every one of these microbes is a
member in good standing

305
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:07,799
of the MlKE ROBE GANG! Isn't that right, Ms
Frizzle?.

306
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,599
I wouldn't CHANGE a thing, Arnold.

307
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:15,913
But microbes DO! They make BlG changes - like
turning a cucumber into a pickle!

308
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,755
So, kids of the jury, it's very clear that Ms Frizzle
DlD NOT, I repeat,

309
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:25,356
DlD NOT turn Keesha's cucumber into a pickle!
And who did?.

310
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,590
THE MlCROBES DlD!!!

311
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,558
So... that pickle is REALLY my cucumber???.!

312
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,995
It is indeed, Keesha.

313
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,318
I rest my case!

314
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,231
Hey, anybody seen the bus?.!

315
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,914
Looks like the bus is in a real pickle!

316
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,670
Members of the jury, have you reached a verdict?.

317
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:58,359
We the jury, find Ms Frizzle innocent of all
charges. YAAAAAAAAAY!

318
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,750
Thank you thank you thank you!

319
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,831
And thank you, Ms Frizzle.

320
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:07,993
If you hadn't put my cucumber into the brine
before we left on vacation

321
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,550
it would have rotted just like Arnold's tomato and
Wanda's carrot.

322
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,551
You're a hero.

323
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:18,760
Well, as you saw, Keesha, I did have a little help
preserving your cucumber.

324
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,752
And turning it into a into a PRlZE PlCKLE!

325
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,517
Well, as my great Uncle Barnard used to say:.

326
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,071
"Cucumbers come and cucumbers go, but pickles
go on forever!"

327
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,916
Case dismissed!!

328
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,918
Is it the magic school bus?.

329
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,228
Is it the magic school bus?.

330
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,389
The magic school bus?.

331
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,515
Is it the magic school bus?.

332
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,874
Is it the magic school bus?.

333
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,552
The magic school bus?.

334
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:00,998
The magic school bus?.

335
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,199
Take water, for example. Under a microscope,

336
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,590
you can see all sorts of things in water you didn't
know were there.

337
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,749
Like what?.

338
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,513
Well, you might see Trachelomonas...Spirogyra...

339
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,876
Fragilaria....Anabaena... or Evensynura!

340
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:56,795
So a microbe is ANY tiny organism that you need
a microscope to see, right?.

341
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,630
You got it!

342
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,996
Well, how many microbes would you have to pile
on top of each other

343
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,389
before you could see them with your naked eye?.

344
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:07,077
Oh, ho ho ho! Millions! But when they DO pile up
like that -

345
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,515
that's when you see them, like with mildew and
mold.

346
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,832
And what about germs?. Those are microbes that
can make you sick, right?.

347
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,276
That's true. But that doesn't mean ALL microbes
are bad.

348
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,952
In fact, most are harmless.

349
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,157
We just called them crooks in the show to make
it a mystery.

350
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,912
Some microbes even help us out.

351
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,873
You mean like the ones that saved Keesha's
cucumber?.

352
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,158
Exactly. Now, some microbes even make the
holes in swiss cheese.

353
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,355
You're kidding!

354
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:36,638
Nope. Others, like bacteria, change milk into
yoghurt and sour cream.

355
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,837
And yeasts are microbes that help make breads
and pizza dough.

356
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,592
Cool! I love pizza.

357
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:46,672
I like pizza, too, but I'm afraid you'll have to call
back for your order.

358
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,036
We have a SMALL problem! Thanks for your
questions.

359
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:55,035
Ho ho ho. Hey, Liz! If you ever get that down, I'll
take one pizza to go:.

360
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,908
cheese, tomatoes, some paramecium, a handful
of lactobactors...

361
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,396
and oh yeah, go easy on the fungus!
