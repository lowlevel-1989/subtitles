00:07:57,367 --> 00:07:57,800
Huh?

185
00:07:57,967 --> 00:07:59,400
Oh, right, you are Tim.

186
00:07:59,633 --> 00:08:01,533
The esophagus connects
them out to the-

187
00:08:01,934 --> 00:08:02,433
Anyone?

188
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,500
I don't know how much
more of this I can <i>stomach</i>.

189
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,467
Ms. Frizzle: Excellent, Ralphie!

190
00:08:08,934 --> 00:08:11,300
The stomach is the next step in digestion.

191
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:15,367
And it's a real doozie!

192
00:08:15,367 --> 00:08:20,867
[Class screaming]

193
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:23,900
In just a few moments we'll
be landing in Arnold's stomach.

194
00:08:24,266 --> 00:08:27,066
Thank you for flying Digestion Airways.

195
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,033
Now that's what I call a belly flop.

196
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,333
[Laughter]

197
00:08:40,867 --> 00:08:41,633
Olive eating.

198
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,667
Now that's a school record I could go for.

199
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,333
Thanks.

200
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:56,000
Wanda would be so impressed.

201
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,734
Oh, Arnold!

202
00:08:59,066 --> 00:09:00,767
Hey, why not?

203
00:09:00,767 --> 00:09:02,300
Ah, oof!

204
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,100
The all school record book.

205
00:09:05,567 --> 00:09:06,400
Olive eating.

206
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,800
978?!

207
00:09:11,934 --> 00:09:14,000
Ok, it doesn't have to be olives.

208
00:09:14,567 --> 00:09:18,734
(dejected) Oh, there have to be other
records waiting to be broken.

209
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,834
(Ms. Frizzle-deep voice) Yo ho ho
and a stomach of slop.

210
00:09:22,633 --> 00:09:25,133
Check out the pink cliffs of Arnold!

211
00:09:25,533 --> 00:09:27,600
Ralphie, that's his stomach wall.

212
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:29,433
Rock, dead ahead!

213
00:09:31,367 --> 00:09:36,000
I bet this is what the pilgrims felt like
before they crashed into Plymouth Rock.

214
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,767
Forget the pilgrims, the walls are moving!

215
00:09:39,734 --> 00:09:42,834
[Screams]

216
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,200
Hard aport, class!

217
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,000
[All gasp]

218
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:55,033
Phoebe: I know Arnold likes rocks, but do
you really think he'd swallow one?

219
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,567
Wanda: That's no rock,

220
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,633
That's Arnold's gum!

221
00:10:01,633 --> 00:10:03,400
Phew, that was close.

222
00:10:03,533 --> 00:10:08,233
Is it just me or do you get the feeling
there's more out there than just food and water?

223
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:11,300
Whatever it is, it's eating the bus.

224
00:10:11,734 --> 00:10:12,500
[Cracking]

225
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Oh, nothing to worry about,
just a little stomach acid.

226
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:18,467
Stomach acid?!

227
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,633
Here at United Digestion, we
believe in breaking things down.

228
00:10:26,066 --> 00:10:28,233
We start with the raw material of the food.

229
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:34,166
Put it in the mouth and use the
finest teeth in the world to tear, grind,

230
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,300
And crush it into pieces
small enough to swallow.

231
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,834
Then the food gets pushed down the
esophagus line into Stomach Central!

232
00:10:43,266 --> 00:10:49,367
Where we add acids and other chemicals to
break the food down and dissolve it into a liquid.

233
00:10:49,567 --> 00:10:53,867
And that's only half of what
we do here at United Digestion.

234
00:10:55,867 --> 00:11:00,233
Man, when it comes to digestion,
Arnold doesn't mess around.

235
00:11:00,633 --> 00:11:02,300
You haven't seen anything yet.

236
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,367
You mean there's... more?

237
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,166
Mmm hmm

238
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,700
All right, Arnold!

239
00:11:08,266 --> 00:11:11,000
If this doesn't impress her, nothing will.

240
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,000
How many more to go, Liz?

241
00:11:13,767 --> 00:11:20,300
One more and I break the school record
for pens stuffed into a pocket protector.

242
00:11:23,734 --> 00:11:25,500
[Screaming]

243
00:11:27,767 --> 00:11:29,000
What's that?

244
00:11:29,567 --> 00:11:32,767
Poor Arnold looks like he's
got a hole in his stomach.

245
00:11:33,233 --> 00:11:35,734
Not a hole, Keisha, a valve.

246
00:11:36,133 --> 00:11:39,266
The doorway to his small intestine!

247
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:43,700
Yeah, well, he just swallowed the gum.

248
00:11:43,767 --> 00:11:46,533
Hey, why hasn't the gum been digested?

249
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,233
A few things are too tough
to be broken up and dissolved.

250
00:11:50,567 --> 00:11:52,600
Like... school buses.

251
00:11:53,133 --> 00:11:53,734
Right?

252
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,100
There's only one way to find out.

253
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:59,500
Here we go!

254
00:12:01,533 --> 00:12:06,700
[Class screaming]

255
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Where are we?

256
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:16,867
It looks like Scuba World.

257
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Welcome to the small intestine,
the next step in digestion.

258
00:12:21,967 --> 00:12:23,000
I don't get it.

259
00:12:23,133 --> 00:12:26,266
The food's been dissolved,
digested, whatever.

260
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,967
What else is left to do?

261
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,667
As I always say, Ralphie,
digested is not delivered.

262
00:12:34,367 --> 00:12:35,500
Anyone for a dip?

263
00:12:36,066 --> 00:12:39,066
Go swimming in Arnold's digestive juice?

264
00:12:39,433 --> 00:12:40,967
Not me, no way.

265
00:12:42,734 --> 00:12:46,266
How was I supposed to know
she'd have digestive juice scuba gear?

266
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:48,400
Isn't this the coolest?

267
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,767
Hey, there's the gum!

268
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,133
I'll be right back.

269
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,467
Hey, look at this!

270
00:12:55,900 --> 00:13:00,533
The dissolved food is disappearing
into these... rubber cactus type things.

271
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,600
They're called villi.

272
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,767
Cool!

273
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,900
They're soaking up the food like a sponge.

274
00:13:08,266 --> 00:13:10,066
But where did it go?

275
00:13:11,266 --> 00:13:15,767
Here at United Digestion,
what we digest, we deliver.

276
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:20,600
As the villi in the small intestine
soak up the nutrients in the food,

277
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:24,000
The nutrients are transferred
into the bloodstream.

278
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,834
And the bloodstream delivers
the nutrients to all parts of the body.

279
00:13:29,467 --> 00:13:35,734
Because here at United Digestion,
we believe in turning food into fuel.

280
00:13:37,266 --> 00:13:38,233
I get it.

281
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:43,066
The bloodstream is like a pizza
delivery service, only it delivers energy.

282
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,700
Speaking of energy, where's Wanda?

283
00:13:46,567 --> 00:13:49,233
[Wanda Screaming]

284
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,266
Wanda!

285
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:56,233
[Brahm's Lullaby]

286
00:13:56,266 --> 00:13:59,867
[Lullaby continues]
[Arnold snoring]

287
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,166
Huh? Did I do it?

288
00:14:05,467 --> 00:14:07,500
Two minutes and four seconds.

289
00:14:07,767 --> 00:14:12,000
How can I break the school napping
record if my stomach keeps waking me up?

290
00:14:13,467 --> 00:14:14,800
Where could she be?

291
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,333
I don't see her anywhere.

292
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,600
Wanda!

293
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,900
Where are you?

294
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,967
Wanda!

295
00:14:21,567 --> 00:14:25,834
We've been through the entire
small intestine, and no sign of her.

296
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:27,834
[Wanda screaming]

297
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:28,934
There she is!

298
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,266
Ah!

299
00:14:32,834 --> 00:14:35,400
Ah, she went into the large intestine.

300
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,433
The large intestine?

301
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,567
You mean there's more?

302
00:14:40,133 --> 00:14:41,100
What's that?

303
00:14:41,367 --> 00:14:43,066
Just Arnold's leftovers.

304
00:14:45,066 --> 00:14:45,800
Watch out!

305
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,000
[Bus beeps]

306
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,333
Whoa!

307
00:14:55,734 --> 00:14:57,333
Boy, what a ride!

308
00:14:57,467 --> 00:14:59,233
Talk about action!

309
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:02,867
[overlapping sounds of disgust]

310
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,500
Man, if the small
intestine was Scuba World,

311
00:15:06,633 --> 00:15:08,066
The large intestine is...

312
00:15:08,467 --> 00:15:10,066
Smell World.

313
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:12,500
At least it's a lot drier in here.

314
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:13,200
Yeah.

315
00:15:13,567 --> 00:15:14,767
But where's Wanda?

316
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:15,900
Wait a minute.

317
00:15:18,934 --> 00:15:19,700
This should work.

318
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,166
Wanda, if you can hear this, give a shout!

319
00:15:24,567 --> 00:15:27,467
Wanda: Ah!

320
00:15:27,834 --> 00:15:28,767
Let's go!

321
00:15:28,934 --> 00:15:29,934
All right!

322
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,867
The further we go, the drier it gets.

323
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,734
It looks like the walls are
sucking up all the water.

324
00:15:43,066 --> 00:15:45,367
That's the large intestine for you.

325
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,934
It removes the water from the leftovers.

326
00:15:48,133 --> 00:15:51,567
So we have to find Wanda
before she gets dried into a raisin.

327
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,367
A raisin?

328
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,133
Cool.

329
00:15:53,633 --> 00:15:54,834
Ralphie!

330
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,000
Um, not cool at all.

331
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,734
Terrible, actually, hehe!

332
00:15:59,100 --> 00:15:59,800
Yikes!

333
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,867
[Screaming]

334
00:16:05,667 --> 00:16:06,433
[Gasps]

335
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,133
Wanda! Don't!

336
00:16:10,133 --> 00:16:19,633
[Wanda screaming]

337
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,700
Gotcha!

338
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:24,700
All right, Carlos!

339
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,300
You saved her.

340
00:16:26,467 --> 00:16:27,633
Saved me?

341
00:16:28,266 --> 00:16:30,800
I was having a blast!

342
00:16:31,133 --> 00:16:36,433
Arnold's digestive system is the wildest,
scariest, scream-your-lungs-out ride in the world!

343
00:16:36,834 --> 00:16:38,600
And it's not over yet.

344
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,033
We've done the mouth.

345
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:44,500
We've done the esophagus, the stomach,
the small intestine, the large intestine.

346
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,834
What could be next?

347
00:16:46,266 --> 00:16:48,000
The extra large intestine?

348
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,200
No.

349
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:53,333
We just have to join the rest of
the waste products and finish the trip.

350
00:16:53,767 --> 00:16:54,667
What?!

351
00:16:55,233 --> 00:16:56,233
Wait a minute.

352
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:59,834
According to my research,
the waste products go...

353
00:17:00,133 --> 00:17:00,934
uh-uh!

354
00:17:00,934 --> 00:17:01,900
No way!

355
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,433
At my old school, we were never
allowed to end up in the toilet.

356
00:17:06,633 --> 00:17:08,500
Anyone have a better idea?

357
00:17:08,867 --> 00:17:11,100
We could go back to the
mouth and ride it again!

358
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,500
Wanda!

359
00:17:12,934 --> 00:17:13,633
She's right.

360
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,567
We could go back the way we came.

361
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,500
I've been keeping track.

362
00:17:16,567 --> 00:17:20,767
And the digestive system is just
one long tube divided into parts.

363
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,767
We started off in the mouth, got
