I told 'em I'd have an
idea for Broadcast Day.

37
00:01:16,467 --> 00:01:17,500


38
00:01:17,633 --> 00:01:19,834
So I'll have an idea for Broadcast Day.

39
00:01:19,967 --> 00:01:21,000


40
00:01:21,266 --> 00:01:24,333
Why don't I have an idea for Broadcast Day?

41
00:01:25,233 --> 00:01:26,300
Mom: Ralphie!

42
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,700
Get up, Ralphie!

43
00:01:29,767 --> 00:01:31,834
You're going to be late for school!

44
00:01:32,033 --> 00:01:33,266
Oh, no!

45
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,600


46
00:01:34,867 --> 00:01:36,934
Ralphie, what are you doing?

47
00:01:37,367 --> 00:01:41,000
Our class is broadcasting two
hours of live television today,

48
00:01:41,233 --> 00:01:43,000
And I said I'd have a show for them to do.

49
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,967
And I don't.

50
00:01:45,266 --> 00:01:45,800
Yet.

51
00:01:45,934 --> 00:01:47,133


52
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,734
But I will.

53
00:01:48,767 --> 00:01:50,000


54
00:01:50,133 --> 00:01:51,100
No, you won't.

55
00:01:51,533 --> 00:01:52,333
What?

56
00:01:52,533 --> 00:01:56,533
It's my opinion as your mother,
and as a doctor that you have a fever,

57
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:59,266
Which means you are sick, which
means you are going back to bed.

58
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,867
But Mom!

59
00:02:01,133 --> 00:02:02,867
No buts about it, Ralphie.

60
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,734
I'm sure your class can do
Broadcast Day without you.

61
00:02:08,734 --> 00:02:10,767
We can't do it without him!

62
00:02:11,867 --> 00:02:13,633
And we go on in an hour!

63
00:02:14,433 --> 00:02:16,000
Where is he?

64
00:02:17,767 --> 00:02:20,467


65
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,834
I'll get it!

66
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:28,533


67
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:31,633
I was wondering what you got to.

68
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,667
Hello?

69
00:02:35,033 --> 00:02:36,567
Yes, Dr. Tennelli.

70
00:02:36,767 --> 00:02:37,900
Dr. Tennelli!

71
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,800
That's Ralphie's mom!

72
00:02:39,867 --> 00:02:41,200
Uh-huh, yes, I see, huh?

73
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:41,934
Uh-huh.

74
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:43,066
Yes?

75
00:02:43,233 --> 00:02:45,567
He's sick? Oh, poor Ralphie.

76
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Why aren't I surprised?

77
00:02:51,233 --> 00:02:53,467
Of course he must stay in bed.

78
00:02:53,734 --> 00:02:54,633
What?

79
00:02:55,033 --> 00:02:56,000
In bed?

80
00:02:56,233 --> 00:02:58,300
What about Broadcast Day?

81
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,867
Yes, Dr. Tennelli.

82
00:02:59,934 --> 00:03:01,333
Thank you for calling.

83
00:03:01,467 --> 00:03:02,266
Bye-bye.

84
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:05,400
Is Ralphie staying home from
school today, Ms. Frizzle?

85
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,333
Yes, I'm afraid so, Arnold.

86
00:03:07,934 --> 00:03:11,200
What are we gonna do? What are we
gonna do? What are we gonna do?

87
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,433
Why we're taking school to him, of course!

88
00:03:14,734 --> 00:03:15,734
To the bus!

89
00:03:17,633 --> 00:03:21,633
Are we doing broadcast day
from Ralphie's room, Ms. Frizzle?

90
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:24,200
What better place to take chances?

91
00:03:24,433 --> 00:03:25,700
Make mistakes!

92
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,533
And it sure is messy!

93
00:03:27,767 --> 00:03:31,700
Ms. Frizzle, are you sure
this visit isn't a field trip?

94
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:32,934


95
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,767
What do you think, Arnold?

96
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,367
Arnold: I think Ralphie shouldn't
have stayed home today.

97
00:03:45,533 --> 00:03:50,000
How can anything that smells like
grape shoe polish help my body get well?

98
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:54,000
It will if you take one
teaspoon three times a day.

99
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,567
And don't forget to
shake well before using.

100
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,633
Like this?

101
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:01,600
Ah-ha! Even your jokes are sick.

102
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,500
Open.

103
00:04:03,433 --> 00:04:04,000
No!

104
00:04:05,266 --> 00:04:06,000
Oh boy!

105
00:04:06,033 --> 00:04:07,000
I feel great!

106
00:04:07,133 --> 00:04:09,000
Mom, you are a miracle doctor.

107
00:04:09,266 --> 00:04:10,200
Can I go to school now?

108
00:04:10,266 --> 00:04:11,533
Forget it, Ralphie.

109
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:13,533
I've gotta go see another patient.

110
00:04:13,667 --> 00:04:15,633
But Grampa's downstairs if you need anything.

111
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,033
I'll check in later!

112
00:04:21,834 --> 00:04:24,900
If I get an idea, I’ll still
have time to phone it in.

113
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,500
That's it! A phone in!

114
00:04:29,266 --> 00:04:30,533


115
00:04:30,533 --> 00:04:30,967
Huh?

116
00:04:30,967 --> 00:04:32,266


117
00:04:32,734 --> 00:04:34,834
Hi, we're here!

118
00:04:35,934 --> 00:04:37,266
Hello!

119
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,233
Ralphie, we're here!

120
00:04:39,433 --> 00:04:41,233
I must be hallucinating.

121
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,567
Maybe I'm sicker than I thought.

122
00:04:45,734 --> 00:04:46,600
Hi, Ralphie!

123
00:04:48,867 --> 00:04:49,700
How you doing?

124
00:04:49,767 --> 00:04:50,567
Uh-oh!

125
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,033
Gee, you look terrible.

126
00:04:53,133 --> 00:04:56,900
Don't worry, I'll have you
camera-ready in no time.

127
00:04:57,133 --> 00:04:58,166


128
00:04:58,367 --> 00:04:59,667
Is it just me?

129
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,100
Or is my entire class standing in my room?

130
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,633
Aren't you glad to see us?

131
00:05:05,967 --> 00:05:07,734
We came to do Broadcast Day.

132
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,367
Really? What a great idea!

133
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:13,266
Now and then I do have them, Ralphie.

134
00:05:14,033 --> 00:05:16,700
Speaking of great ideas, what’s yours, Ralphie?

135
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,467
Mine? Oh, you mean for Broadcast Day?

136
00:05:20,967 --> 00:05:21,967


137
00:05:23,567 --> 00:05:25,467
Oh, you’d better take it easy, Ralphie.

138
00:05:25,667 --> 00:05:29,600
Your body is telling you to <i>slow down</i>

139
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:31,433
But, Ms. Frizzle, I can’t!

140
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,700
We have a show to do!

141
00:05:32,934 --> 00:05:34,500
What does my body know anyway?

142
00:05:34,633 --> 00:05:39,800
Oh, it knows a lot about the detection
and rejection of infection, Ralphie.

143
00:05:40,266 --> 00:05:40,934
Whoa!

144
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,667
Inside you, at this moment, there
is action, excitement and adventure!

145
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Exactly what we need for our show.

146
00:05:49,567 --> 00:05:51,433
So, what's your idea, Ralphie?

147
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,333
Oh, well, um...

148
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,000


149
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,333
Oh, what's going on with my body anyway?

150
00:05:59,433 --> 00:06:02,100
Oh, that's an excellent question, Ralphie!

151
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,500
Class, everyone back to the bus!

152
00:06:05,934 --> 00:06:06,900
Huh?

153
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,667
But Ms. Frizzle, we just got here.

154
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:11,000
Mm-hmm.

155
00:06:11,133 --> 00:06:12,166
Single file pl-

156
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:12,700
Wait!

157
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,500
Where are you going?

158
00:06:15,133 --> 00:06:17,233
You can't go on a field trip now!

159
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,233
And I can't do broadcast day all by myself.

160
00:06:22,533 --> 00:06:23,867


161
00:06:23,934 --> 00:06:25,033
I'm sick.

162
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,433
Huh?

163
00:06:34,533 --> 00:06:35,467
Wait a minute!

164
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,900
What's going on?

165
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,300
It was your idea, Ralfi.

166
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,000
We're here to get the inside story!

167
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:47,734
Inside story?

168
00:06:48,133 --> 00:06:49,266
Inside what?

169
00:06:49,633 --> 00:06:51,533
What about Broadcast Day?

170
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:56,500
Think, Ralphie!
Where is all the action right now?

171
00:06:56,734 --> 00:06:57,633
The action?

172
00:06:57,734 --> 00:07:00,066
Liz! What are you doing?

173
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:01,700
Hang on a second.

174
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:04,300
The action is all inside me.

175
00:07:04,533 --> 00:07:06,000
What a great idea!

176
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,934
Broadcast Day could be about
what's going on inside me!

177
00:07:10,233 --> 00:07:11,467
Exxon and Ralfi?

178
00:07:11,667 --> 00:07:14,000
Rrrrrrolllll tape!

179
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,133
This is FNN.

180
00:07:17,767 --> 00:07:19,333
Good afternoon. I'm Ralphie.

181
00:07:19,433 --> 00:07:21,834
And this is the Frizzle News Network.

182
00:07:22,133 --> 00:07:27,900
Welcome to our live, on-the-scene coverage of
a natural disaster of major proportions.

183
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:30,000
My poor sick body.

184
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,934
Over to you, Keisha.

185
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,100
Thanks, Ralphie.

186
00:07:33,533 --> 00:07:36,266
One disturbing question
remains unanswered at this hour.

187
00:07:36,433 --> 00:07:37,767
What's making Ralphie sick?

188
00:07:38,133 --> 00:07:40,667
The FNN news team hopes to find out.

189
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,033
And to do that, they will go
straight to the troubled zone.

190
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,333
My sore throat.

191
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,000
Seat belts, everyone.

192
00:07:48,133 --> 00:07:49,934
Ralphie say, "Ah!"

193
00:07:51,767 --> 00:07:54,000


194
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,467


195
00:07:56,567 --> 00:07:57,500


196
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,266
Cool.

197
00:08:00,433 --> 00:08:03,533
I've never seen that
from the outside before.

198
00:08:04,533 --> 00:08:07,333
The FNN news team is
nearing the disaster area.

199
00:08:08,934 --> 00:08:11,100
In a moment, we will have live footage.

200
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:14,000
Ralphie: See anything yet?

201
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,567
Woah!

202
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,533
Ah, get a shot of those vocal cords, class.

203
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,200
Look how red and swollen his throat is.

204
00:08:23,533 --> 00:08:25,266
No wonder it hurts.

205
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,367
The question is, why is it red and swollen?

206
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,467
And why does it-

207
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,900


208
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,767
Class: Yow!

209
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,867


210
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,000


211
00:08:43,467 --> 00:08:44,333


212
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,967
Hey, where'd they go?

213
00:08:48,133 --> 00:08:49,133
Where's the bus?

214
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:52,633
Huh?

215
00:08:55,967 --> 00:08:58,800
Ralphie, did you have to cough?

216
00:08:59,133 --> 00:09:00,000
Sorry.

217
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,633


218
00:09:00,867 --> 00:09:02,166
I couldn't help it.

219
00:09:02,467 --> 00:09:06,400
At this rate, we'll never get the
inside story of what's making Ralphie sick.

220
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,367
We've got to find another way in.

221
00:09:09,734 --> 00:09:10,367
Mm-hmm.

222
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,133
It's not as easy for us or germs to
get inside the body as you might think.

223
00:09:15,367 --> 00:09:17,734
Yeah, skin pretty much covers it.

224
00:09:17,967 --> 00:09:21,233
How are you gonna get the
inside story if you can't get inside?

225
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,600
Wait a second.

226
00:09:23,867 --> 00:09:24,934
I've got it!

227
00:09:29,633 --> 00:09:30,567
Look at this!

228
00:09:30,867 --> 00:09:32,200
Is it just me?

229
00:09:32,367 --> 00:09:34,967
Or does this say this way in?

230
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,367
It's a shortcut.

231
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,166
Get it?

232
00:09:37,367 --> 00:09:38,000
Shortcut?

233
00:09:38,133 --> 00:09:39,767
Carlos! Yuck!

234
00:09:39,967 --> 00:09:42,300
Excellent observation, Carlos.

235
00:09:42,467 --> 00:09:44,000
Seat belts, everyone!

236
00:09:49,734 --> 00:09:50,967
Wow!

237
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,500
You saw him first on FNN News.

238
00:09:54,567 --> 00:09:55,867
Hey, you guys!

239
00:09:55,934 --> 00:09:57,433
The whole world wants to know.

240
00:09:57,767 --> 00:10:00,867
Now that you found a way in,
how are you gonna get to my throat?

241
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:02,200
Ralphie's right!

242
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:03,867
We're all the way down at the knee.

243
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,133
Hmm, let's see if I can
put you in the picture.

244
00:10:10,033 --> 00:10:13,834
As I always say, for every
trip, there's a road map.

245
00:10:14,367 --> 00:10:16,367
That's Ralphie's bloodstream!

246
00:10:17,133 --> 00:10:20,734
Could we travel through his
bloodstream to get to his throat?

247
00:10:20,934 --> 00:10:23,000
Absolutely, Dorothy Ann!

What are those?

255
00:10:49,133 --> 00:10:51,900
Those are tiny, tiny blood vessels.

256
00:10:52,133 --> 00:10:54,400
They're all part of the bloodstream.

Woah!

262
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,734
Is that my blood?

263
00:11:18,467 --> 00:11:20,567
But I thought blood was red!

264
00:11:21,133 --> 00:11:22,500
That stuff is clear.

265
00:11:22,867 --> 00:11:24,567
That's right, Ralphie.

266
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
The liquid part of the blood is clear.

267
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,533
So what are those red things?

268
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,000
Are they what make blood look red?

269
00:11:32,433 --> 00:11:35,133
Scintillating surmise, Ralfi.

270
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:39,033
According to my research,
they're called red blood cells.

271
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:42,000
And the white ones are white blood cells.

272
00:11:42,467 --> 00:11:44,700
But what are those jaggedy things?

273
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,967
Those are platelets.

274
00:11:47,033 --> 00:11:49,600
They help the body heal scrapes and cuts.

275
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,633
But we still don't know
what's making me feel sick.

00:12:10,633 --> 00:12:11,834
Yeah!

What's that you're watching?

289
00:12:29,066 --> 00:12:32,934
What? This? It's um, nothing.

290
00:12:33,667 --> 00:12:35,567
Just some movie.

291
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,767
You wouldn't like it.

292
00:12:36,867 --> 00:12:38,200
Oh, I don't know about that.

293
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,300
It's remarkably realistic.

294
00:12:40,734 --> 00:12:43,066
Look, red blood cells.

295
00:12:43,367 --> 00:12:46,633
And those look exactly
like white blood cells.

296
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,633
Nah, are you kidding?

297
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,667
Those are just cheap special effects.

298
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,033
Look, you can even see the wires.

299
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:56,133

We are?

301
00:12:57,567 --> 00:12:59,233
We're in Ralphie's throat?

302
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,767
There are a lot more
white blood cells here.

303
00:13:01,867 --> 00:13:02,800
Where are they going?

304
00:13:02,834 --> 00:13:04,300
Looks like they're after something.

305
00:13:04,567 --> 00:13:06,133
Follow the white blood cells.

306
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,867
Sorry, Ralphie. What did you say?

307
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,734
Me? Did I say something?

308
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:15,400
Look, that truck thing is
following the white blood cells

309
00:13:15,433 --> 00:13:18,166
Through the blood vessel wall to
the place where the infection is.

310
00:13:18,433 --> 00:13:20,767
Yes! They're getting the inside story!

Whoo!

313
00:13:28,734 --> 00:13:31,700
Ah, now that we're inside
Ralphie's throat tissue,

314
00:13:31,867 --> 00:13:33,767
Time for some on-the-spot reporting!

315
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,767
Up close and personal.

317
00:13:39,633 --> 00:13:42,633
The trick here is not to make eye contact.

319
00:13:45,266 --> 00:13:48,734

Way to go, guys. Take chances.

322

Get messy. Get out there.

323
00:13:56,767 --> 00:13:57,934
Get the story.

324
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,400
Just don't mention my name, okay?

325
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,934
Ralphie, are you talking to yourself?

326
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,333
Not exactly, mom.

327
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:10,066
And now, over to Keisha and
Carlos live from the throat.

328
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:14,400
Ralphie, that little girl looks
just like your friend Wanda.

329
00:14:14,834 --> 00:14:18,400
Who, her? No, no, no. Wanda's much shorter.

330
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:23,000
Carlos here, we're out here in the throat
tissue trying to find out what's going on and-

331
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,166
Hey!

00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:29,000
Look at that, folks!

334
00:14:29,767 --> 00:14:30,500
Whoa!

335
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,867
Have we got us some action here!

336
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,834
Those yellow-green balls
are destroying that wall.

337
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:39,633
What are those green things?

338
00:14:39,667 --> 00:14:41,033
Those are bacterial cells.

339
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,200
They're actually not unlike the
bacteria that are making you sick.

340
00:14:44,367 --> 00:14:47,300
That's bacteria, and it's making me sick?

341
00:14:48,934 --> 00:14:52,767
This just in, folks. That's
bacteria, and it's making Ralphie sick.

342
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,867
And according to my
research, bacteria are germs.

343
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:00,633
Once inside our bodies, they can make us sick.

344
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,934
Ralphie has a bacterial infection!

345
00:15:04,433 --> 00:15:05,066
This is it!

346
00:15:05,867 --> 00:15:07,300
The inside story!

347
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,767
Bacteria invade throat!

348
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,633
Is it just me? Or did they say Ralphie?

349
00:15:12,734 --> 00:15:16,500
No, no. It says here this
shows about a guy named Alfie.

350
00:15:16,867 --> 00:15:19,233
Ix-nay on my ame-nay.

351
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,800
The bacteria from Ralphie's
throat infection are everywhere!

352
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,266
And they're destroying his throat cells!

353
00:15:25,533 --> 00:15:28,700
Look! Look! Here comes some white blood cells!

354
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,867
Whoa!

355
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,000
Wow!

356
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,000
It's throwing stuff at the bacteria!

357
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,500
That...that was incredible!

358
00:15:41,734 --> 00:15:44,533
That white blood cell
just ate those bacteria!

359
00:15:45,567 --> 00:15:48,333
That huge battle is going on inside me?

360
00:15:49,734 --> 00:15:51,734
I mean inside Alfie.

361
00:15:53,533 --> 00:15:56,300
This battle is raging! Who's going to win?

362
00:15:57,066 --> 00:15:58,734
No wonder I'm sick.

363
00:15:58,867 --> 00:16:01,400
Arnold here, on
location with the infection.

364
00:16:01,633 --> 00:16:05,233
I'm going to try to get an exclusive
interview with these two bacteria.

365
00:16:08,533 --> 00:16:10,533
I mean, four bacteria.

366
00:16:11,266 --> 00:16:13,200
I mean, eight bacteria?

367
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:15,667
Hey guys! They're multiplying!

368
00:16:15,867 --> 00:16:16,967
Help!

369
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,200
Bad news, guys.

370
00:16:19,734 --> 00:16:22,500
The bacteria from the
infection are multiplying faster

371
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,033
Than the white blood cells can gobble them up!

372
00:16:25,367 --> 00:16:26,600
We're losing!

373
00:16:26,667 --> 00:16:29,000
Let's get out of here!

374
00:16:34,934 --> 00:16:37,066
How could my body lose?

375
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,000
Ralphie, are you alright?

376
00:16:39,133 --> 00:16:41,033
I don't think you should be watching this.

377
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,333
No!

378
00:16:42,467 --> 00:16:46,266
I mean, please don't turn it off, Mom.

379
00:16:46,567 --> 00:16:48,000
I want to see how it ends.

380
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:50,066
I'll tape it for us downstairs.

381
00:16:50,567 --> 00:16:52,000
But you don't understand!

382
00:16:52,767 --> 00:16:56,000
What I understand is that your
body needs to save its strength

383
00:16:56,033 --> 00:16:58,567
So it can use its energy
to battle those bacteria.

384
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,400
You have to rest, sweetheart.
It's not just me, Ralphie.

385
00:17:02,667 --> 00:17:07,200
Any good doctor knows the
best cure is complete rest.

386
00:17:10,667 --> 00:17:12,333
Over to me, Dorothy Ann.

387
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,633
Right now, the white
blood cells are losing!

388
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,367
Certainly looks that way, Dorothy Ann.

389
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,633
They need help. They need backup support.

390
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,266
Ralphie, did you hear me?!

391
00:17:24,734 --> 00:17:27,066
Where's our backup support?

392
00:17:28,066 --> 00:17:29,800
Backup support.

393
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:32,066
Where do I get that?

394
00:17:32,367 --> 00:17:35,066
Not to worry, Ralphie.
It's already on its way.

395
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,567
Cue the medicine!

396
00:17:37,233 --> 00:17:39,834
Is that the medicine Mom gave me earlier?

397
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,533
It sure is, Ralphie.

398
00:17:41,667 --> 00:17:43,333
Look what it's doing!

399
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,400
It's destroying more bacteria.

400
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:52,600
The medicine is giving the
white blood cells another chance.

401
00:17:53,033 --> 00:17:55,967
And they're throwing out
even more of those stick things.

402
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,367
Oh, those stick things are antibodies.

403
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,367
The white blood cells use
them to mark the bacteria.

404
00:18:04,133 --> 00:18:06,000
The...

405
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,233
I hope this doesn't mean
what I think it means.

406
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,000
Oh no!

407
00:18:11,467 --> 00:18:15,367
Ralphie's antibodies have
marked the bus as bacteria!

408
00:18:15,567 --> 00:18:17,066
We're not bacteria,

409
00:18:17,567 --> 00:18:19,166
We're Ralphie's friends!

410
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,300
But his white blood cells
are doing such a good job,

411
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,967
They now recognize us as enemies too.

412
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,300
Enemies?

413
00:18:26,467 --> 00:18:30,000
But we know what white
blood cells do to enemies.

414
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,567
That's right, Arnold.
They'll try to destroy us.

415
00:18:33,867 --> 00:18:35,367
Destroy us?!

416
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,734
Ah, the wonder of the human body.

417
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,533
Ralphie! Do something!

418
00:18:44,567 --> 00:18:47,433
Ralphie! You've gotta help us!

419
00:18:48,133 --> 00:18:52,934


420
00:18:58,633 --> 00:19:01,633
Ralphie! Help!

421
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:03,567
Ralphie!

422
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,300
Oh, don't worry, class.

423
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:12,033
In order to destroy us, Ralphie's
white blood cells will have to catch us first. 

424
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,934
But we've got to get
out of Ralphie's throat.

425
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,433
Good thinking, Keisha.

426
00:19:30,767 --> 00:19:34,133
When the spot is tight, hang a right!

427
00:19:48,834 --> 00:19:52,967
Broadcast Day! The story!
Where is everybody?

428
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:56,000
Ms. Frizzle here with an
update on the Ralphie story.

429
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:59,333
To escape the white blood cells,
we left Ralphie’s throat

430
00:19:59,433 --> 00:20:02,567
And are now heading up
his nasopharyngeal passages.

431
00:20:03,066 --> 00:20:03,967
The what?

432
00:20:04,266 --> 00:20:06,834
According to my
research, that means...

433
00:20:07,367 --> 00:20:08,767
His nose?

434
00:20:09,066 --> 00:20:11,633
We're up Ralphie's nose?

435
00:20:11,967 --> 00:20:13,700
Ew!

436
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
That's the inside of my nose?

437
00:20:16,934 --> 00:20:17,767
Weird.

438
00:20:19,834 --> 00:20:20,400
Achoo!

439
00:20:20,633 --> 00:20:21,300
Bless you.

440
00:20:22,533 --> 00:20:25,533
Of course, there's no telling how
long we'll have to stay here.

441
00:20:26,066 --> 00:20:28,100
Or how long we <i>can </i>stay here.

442
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,834
Liz, I'm trying to think here.

443
00:20:31,867 --> 00:20:34,867
I get it. I've got to sneeze them out!

444
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:37,000
But I don't feel like sneezing.

445
00:20:40,066 --> 00:20:44,400
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, achoo!

446
00:20:44,867 --> 00:20:47,433
Wheeeeee!

447
00:20:48,066 --> 00:20:50,467
Second floor, boy socks, woo!

448
00:20:50,867 --> 00:20:51,667
Going up!

449
00:20:53,567 --> 00:20:54,934
All right,

450
00:20:55,066 --> 00:20:56,633
Way to go, Ralphie!

451
00:20:56,767 --> 00:20:57,800
Yeah!

452
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,000
This is Keisha still reporting
to you live for FNN.

453
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,800
We are now back in Ralphie's room.

454
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:12,100
So, Ralphie, what do you have to
say about today's amazing adventure?

455
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,200
Well, I'm sorry that my
body made such a mess of it.

456
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,266
Wait a minute.

457
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,333
Do you really think
your body's been working against you?

458
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,266
Sure.

459
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,767
And against you, too.

460
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,867
You almost didn't get in. Remember?

461
00:21:24,967 --> 00:21:28,600
Only because your body's built to
keep out things like a bunch of germs.

462
00:21:29,133 --> 00:21:30,467
Or a bus full of kids.

463
00:21:30,934 --> 00:21:34,300
And my throat is so sore I can barely talk.

464
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:38,800
Only because your body is sending
extra blood there to help fight the infection.

465
00:21:38,834 --> 00:21:44,567
Okay, but what about when you almost
got gobbled up by my white blood cells?

466
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,100
Only because your body
thought we were bacteria.

467
00:21:47,567 --> 00:21:50,133
Your body was only trying to protect you.

468
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,200
I guess you're right. My body
was just trying to get rid of germs.

469
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,567
Like you!

470
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,567


471
00:21:57,633 --> 00:21:59,000
Come along, class.

472
00:21:59,266 --> 00:22:00,567
Good old body.

473
00:22:02,367 --> 00:22:06,667
Hmm, so that's the inside
story, isn't it, Miss Frizzle?

474
00:22:07,433 --> 00:22:09,934
That's the inside story, Ralphie.

475
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,233
Pretty amazing, don't you think?

476
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,367
Well, we may have won the battle,
class, but he's still fighting the war.

477
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,767
Hey, guys, how's this for a concept?

478
00:22:23,066 --> 00:22:25,567
Inside Ralphie, the series!

479
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,867
Week one, he gets a charlie horse,

480
00:22:28,033 --> 00:22:29,867
Week two, tennis elbow,

481
00:22:30,133 --> 00:22:34,133
Week three, the final episode, athelete's foot!

482
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,567


483
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,400


484
00:22:42,533 --> 00:22:43,734
Is this the Magic School Bus?

485
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,133
Is this the Magic School Bus?

486
00:22:45,133 --> 00:22:46,867
Magic School Bus?
Magic School Bus?

487
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:49,500
 Magic School Bus?

488
00:22:49,567 --> 00:22:50,533
Magic School Bus?

489
00:22:50,633 --> 00:22:52,000
Magic School Bus?

490
00:22:52,433 --> 00:22:54,000
I want the Magic School Bus!

491
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:56,367
I want the Magic School Bus!

492
00:23:01,233 --> 00:23:03,233
Sorry, Liz, but I can't hear a thing.

493
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:08,400
Liz, your heart sounds like a telephone.

494
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,000
Hello.

495
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,200
Hello. Is this the Magic School Bus?

496
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,133
Yes, and you're talking to the producer.
Can I help you?

497
00:23:18,867 --> 00:23:22,767
Yeah, what were those kids doing visiting Ralphie
when he was so sick and tired?

498
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:25,000
Oh, well don't worry, he wasn't infectious.

499
00:23:25,166 --> 00:23:26,567
But thanks for calling. Bye.

500
00:23:31,934 --> 00:23:33,400
Hello, Magic School Bus.

501
00:23:33,734 --> 00:23:36,533
You know, Ralphie shouldn't
go around picking scabs.

502
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,734
If the Magic School Bus
got in, so could germs.

503
00:23:39,834 --> 00:23:40,700
A good point.

504
00:23:40,867 --> 00:23:44,000
Bandages, like skin, are there
to keep germs out of your body.

505
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,133
Bacteria aren't the only
things it can make you sick.

506
00:23:48,066 --> 00:23:50,767
There are viruses, parasites, fungi, and...

507
00:23:50,767 --> 00:23:53,767
Right, and some sickness
isn't caused by infection,

508
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,233
But by the body's own systems not working right.

509
00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:57,500
Thanks for calling. Bye.

510
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,100
Whoo!

511
00:24:03,967 --> 00:24:05,467
Hello, Magic School Bus.

512
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,900
Well, I think that somebody should
say that medicine can be dangerous.

513
00:24:09,934 --> 00:24:13,433
And kids should never take
medicines without an adult in charge.

514
00:24:13,567 --> 00:24:15,000
You just did, thank you.

515
00:24:15,767 --> 00:24:17,734
Um, did Ralphie ever get better?

516
00:24:17,867 --> 00:24:22,367
He sure did. His body did a great
job of getting rid of all those germs,

517
00:24:22,467 --> 00:24:24,800
and he got just as
healthy as he was before.

518
00:24:25,033 --> 00:24:28,166
And they should also say that your
body's always trying to be healthy.

519
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:32,200
You're absolutely right, and
there's a lot you can do to help it out.

520
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,200
I know.

521
00:24:33,767 --> 00:24:37,033
Like eating properly, getting
enough sleep, and exercising.

522
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:39,700
Getting all your shots is
another way to keep healthy.

523
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,734
Shots help your body be prepared
for some of the really tough germs.

524
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,100
I don't like getting shots.
They sometimes hurt.

525
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,100
Me neither.

526
00:24:48,467 --> 00:24:53,200
But I also don't like getting sick, and I'd
rather get a shot now than get sick later.

527
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,467
Me too, I guess.

528
00:24:54,867 --> 00:24:56,767
Hey, does Miss Frizzle ever get sick?

529
00:24:56,834 --> 00:24:58,166
No way!

530
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:03,767
She takes good care of herself, gets
all of her shots, and she's magic.
