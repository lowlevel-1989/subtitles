0
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,911
Why Liz, what luck! You've found a ladybug.

1
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,196
Yes, folks - l'd just like to say, l couldn't have
done it without... Seeds!

2
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,035
lt was seeds from a pack like this that grew
into these prize winning tomato plants!

3
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,310
Carlos, WHAT are you doing?

4
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,675
Practicing being famous, what else?

5
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,348
What makes you think you're going to be
famous?

6
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,636
Not just me -- all of us!

7
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:00,072
Think - the photographer shows up at three,
and takes a picture of us in our garden...

8
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,278
...The picture goes on the cover of Plant lt!
Magazine, and we're FAMOUS!

9
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,192
So, there we go, Phoebe, it's finished!

10
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,551
Oh, thank you, Tim! That's exactly what my
plant looks like.

11
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,195
Plant? What plant? l don't see a plant.

12
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,194
You're not looking, Carlos. This is it! See?

13
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:24,996
Phoebe!

14
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,238
You don't get on the cover of Plant lt!
Magazine with a DRAWlNG of a plant!

15
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,272
l've got a real one -- it's just not here...

16
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,549
lt's at my old school.

17
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,437
When l was in Mr. Seedplot's class...

18
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,438
But, Phoebe, this is your NEW school!

19
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,917
l tried to get one, l really did. l even wrote a
letter to Mr. Seedplot

20
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,079
to see if he could bring me one. But so far
nothing.

21
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,316
l don't care if you wrote the president!

22
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,715
We need your plant HERE! NOW!

23
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,789
No hurry to worry, Carlos. There's always
time to take chances,

24
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,514
make mistakes, get WHEELS!

25
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,392
Mistakes? Wheels? This is starting to sound
like a...

26
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,958
FlELD TRlP!

27
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,191
As l always say, if the plant won't come to you,
go to the plant!

28
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:22,272
We're going to my old school? All of us?
Now?

29
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,677
All right! Come on, Phoebe! We don't have
much time!

30
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,319
Oh no!

31
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,871
Phoebe, aren't you excited?

32
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,434
A field trip to your old school!

33
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,034
l'd like to meet Mr. Seedplot!

34
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,794
Meet Mr. Seedplot?

35
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,792
Um, Mr. Seedplot! l'd like you to meet--

36
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,550
Take chances! Make mistakes! Get messy!

37
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,392
We never did anything like this at our old
school.

38
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,398
How embarrassing...

39
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,632
At this rate, we'll never get back in time for the
photograph!

40
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,273
Can't we fly there, Ms Frizzle?

41
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,510
Excellent idea, Carlos.

42
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,435
Ms. Frizzle, at my old school, things are kind
of quiet...

43
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,476
Yes...

44
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,551
And people don't shrink or anything...

45
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,079
Of course not, Phoebe.

46
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,509
And buses don't turn into things...

47
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,679
But, Phoebe. A ladybug isn't a thing! lt's an
insect.

48
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,799
Oh no!

49
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,196
Here we go again!

50
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,873
A ladybug?

51
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,948
l was hoping supersonic jet...

52
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,831
l was hoping invisible.

53
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,756
There it is...! My old school!

54
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,519
What will Mr. Seedplot say if he sees us?

55
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,910
l don't get it, Ms. Frizzle.

56
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,993
How are we ever going to find Phoebe's plant
if we're so small?

57
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,833
lt never hurts to have a bug's eye view!

58
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,195
Or a view of a bug's eye...!

59
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,715
Okay, everybody. Here's what we're looking
for.

60
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,068
And there it is!!

61
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,077
Yeah! All right!

62
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,075
Those plants are drop-dead gorgeous.

63
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,513
Now, can we get big again, dig one of them
up, and get back in time to be famous?

64
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,834
Well, Carlos, l'll see what l can do!

65
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,515
Talk about HANGlNG a left.

66
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,073
l HATE it when we go upside-down.

67
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:49,712
Ms. Frizzle, you DlD pass your ladybug driving
test, right?

68
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,353
With flying colors.

69
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,716
We're on a flower petal!

70
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,269
Oh please, somebody tell me this isn't
happening.

71
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,035
lt's happening.

72
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,072
lsn't it wonderful, class?

73
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,158
The sky above...a flower below...

74
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,637
A pothole dead ahead!

75
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,319
What's happening!!

76
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,831
Perfect landing, Liz.

77
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,152
Class, we're well on our way to getting Phoebe
a plant.

78
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,395
But we're stuck!

79
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,316
That too!

80
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,590
Could Mr. Seedplot see us if he looked?

81
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,752
Probably not. We're down here, in your
flower.

82
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,112
Then let's hope we stay down here.

83
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,400
No taking chances. No getting messy. And
most of all, no getting out of the BUS.

84
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,910
Okay, class! Everybody out!

85
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:48,274
Wait! Don't! Mr. Seedplot might see us!
Please!

86
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,279
Maybe you should have stayed home today,
Phoebe.

87
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,359
Oh, no!

88
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,389
We're stuck!

89
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,232
How are we gonna get outta here?

90
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,992
Follow me, class. Take chances, make
mistakes, get slippery!

91
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,515
Ready or not, here l come!

92
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,560
l can't let Mr. Seedplot catch me out there,

93
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,318
how embarassing.

94
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,956
Thanks Liz, Mr. Seedplot won't recognize me
with this on...

95
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,914
Hey, Phoebe! Nice disguise.

96
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,313
Forget it.

97
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,118
This stuff is sweet. What is it?

98
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,955
ls it just me or do you get the feeling

99
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,554
we're the cherries in somebody's ice cream
soda?

100
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,479
lt's looks like a soda straw, Ralphie, but it's
really a proboscis.

101
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,952
A proboscis?

102
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,599
That's right, Keesha. Every bee has a
proboscis.

103
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,398
And they use them to drink the stuff we're
stuck in?

104
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,195
According to my research, this stuff is nectar.

105
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,319
On the proboscis, Dorothy Ann!

106
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,469
l like a proboscis as much as the next guy,

107
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,757
but what we need is a probuscis to get us out
of here.

108
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,434
Okay - what should we do what should we do
what should we do?

109
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:33,389
Hey! l know! Let's get lots of bees to drink all
the nectar around the bus.

110
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,636
How? Send out invitations?

111
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,110
Yes! That's it! Look at these lines.

112
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,198
They seem to be pointing to the pools of
nectar in the flower.

113
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,632
Okay, so maybe they're like a flower's version
of landing lights.

114
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,634
l get it! So if we made more lines,

115
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,638
maybe we could get more bugs to come and
suck up the nectar!

116
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,073
Excellent, Liz.

117
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,839
Wanda, C'mon.

118
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,559
Go Wanda go...!

119
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,955
Yes! Here they come!

120
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,558
AlR RAlD!

121
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,036
As l always say, let them eat NECTAR!

122
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,953
lt worked! We did it!

123
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,389
Here we go!

124
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,713
Phoebe's plant, here we come!

125
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,919
Let's get the facts: plants make nectar for
insects.

126
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,232
And then use flowers to show them where it is.

127
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,670
But l hope they don't show Mr. Seedplot where
we are.

128
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,073
Now, were was l?

129
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,989
Oh yes...''So l hope you can help me, Mr.
Seedplot,

130
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,873
because l don't want to let my new class
down.''

131
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,991
Well, Phoebe, l certainly won't let you down.

132
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,239
l'm just not sure which plant was yours...

133
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,914
lt's almost three o'clock.

134
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,549
Can we PLEASE grab one of Phoebe's flowers
and get back to school now?

135
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:32,399
Carlos, for every quethion, there's an anther.

136
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,197
An anther, that's the part of the flower we're
sitting on!

137
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,396
Check out all the yellow balls!

138
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,558
two things make me sneeze...pollen and
pepper.

139
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,999
this isn't pepper...

140
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,919
So it must be pollen.

141
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,600
And it's floating around EVERYwhere!

142
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,192
Nice propulsion, Arnold!

143
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:00,838
Thank you, Ms. Frizzle. l knew l should ah, ah,
ah stayed home today.

144
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:05,994
Look The bees are getting covered with
pollen!

145
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,597
Looks like they're saving some for later.

146
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,198
Binoculars! Quick!

147
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,793
lt's Mr. Seedplot!

148
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:28,235
Ms. Frizzle, could we please shrink again?!
Really small!

149
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,636
Small as... uh... POLLEN

150
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,272
All right, Phoebe, since it's such a tiny
request--

151
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,839
But if we're small as POLLEN,

152
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,913
even if we make the cover of Plant lt!
Magazine, we'll be too small to see!

153
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,712
MS. FRlZZLE!

154
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:52,150
Egad! l believe l've discovered a new insect -
''The Vanishing Ladybug''

155
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,114
Though it's going to be hard to prove...

156
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,556
Whew, that was close. Thanks, Ms. Frizzle.

157
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,399
And thank you, Phoebe

158
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,439
for letting our chance at gardening fame rot on
the vine.

159
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:12,155
ls it just me, or is that a BlG HAlRY BEE'S
LEG?

160
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,396
You better bee-lieve it! And it's going to get us
out of here!

161
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,316
lt is...?

162
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,389
You bet!

163
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,995
This is so cool, we're stuck to a bumblebee!

164
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,235
At my old school, we never rode on
bumblebees.

165
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,074
We ARE at your old school, Phoebe.

166
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,713
Oh, right.

167
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,796
Hey Phoebe, look!

168
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,151
The bee's taking us and the pollen to another
one of your flowers.

169
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,511
Giving us the brush-off, huh?

170
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,071
l think we'd just landed on another part of
Phoebe's flower

171
00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:01,315
Oh great...more pollen.

172
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,595
l get it!

173
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,958
The insects bring pollen from one flower to
another.

174
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,158
Yeah, but what does it have to do with bringing
plants from one SCHOOL to another?

175
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,914
There are several ways to find out the answer
to that. . .

176
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,917
...and l choose this one!

177
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,469
She's lost it...

178
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,668
Where are we?

179
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,518
Right here! l think...

180
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,748
The bee has taken us--and lots of pollen--to
the top of the female part of the flower.

181
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:47,796
Ms. Frizzle, may l be excused to find some
more... !

182
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,399
Tissue!!!!

183
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:00,878
Arnold, come back here! You've gone the
wrong way!

184
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:05,073
Cool! Arnold just discovered that pollen grows
a tube down into the flower!

185
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,359
Yes, this is the plant for Phoebe.

186
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,675
Wait for ME!!!!

187
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,829
Or is it?

188
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,478
l can't believe she just did that!

189
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,876
As l always say, all pollen tubes lead to home.

190
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,439
This way class.

191
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,874
Wait for ME!

192
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,472
But what about the cover of Plant lt!
Magazine?

193
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,313
Another second and Mr. Seedplot would have
seen us!

194
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,119
Oh swell! Where are we?

195
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:02,351
Let me see... here! Because pollen tubes
grow down.

196
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,196
We're totally inside my flower.

197
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,594
Phoebe, what are you doing now? We've got
to get your...

198
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,038
Safe at last! What a relief!

199
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,315
Phoebe, get off! lt's alive!

200
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,637
The rock l was sitting on, it started to grow!

201
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,750
This isn't rock, l know rocks.

202
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,279
This is part of the plant.

203
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,119
l think Arnold's right. Looks more like an egg
to me.

204
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,596
l wonder if it started to grow when the pollen
tube reached it.

205
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,590
They're all over the place.

206
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,829
What are they?

207
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,154
Did l miss something?

208
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,470
Did we come to Phoebe's old school to get her
plant,

209
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,710
or to see ''lnvasion of the Pollen Tubes?''

210
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,430
Carlos, you'll be happy to know that they are
what we came for.

211
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,630
But we only need one.

212
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,031
We came for a plant. This isn't a plant.

213
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,316
Not yet, it isn't. But it will be.

214
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,109
lt's a plant waiting to happen.

215
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,112
Of course! l get it! lt's a SEED!!

216
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,196
My plant is making seeds!

217
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,754
Dynamic deduction! Phoebe.

218
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,032
The bee carried the pollen, lands on a flower's
stigma and grow tubes down to the eggs.

219
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,037
and together they make seeds!

220
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:20,076
So all we have to do is take this seed back,

221
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,078
plant it in our garden, and we'll be famous!

222
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,192
Great. There's still one small problem.

223
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,430
What?

224
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,310
TlME!

225
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:33,468
There's not a seed in the world that can
become a PLANT in FlVE MlNUTES!

226
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:39,472
As l always say, time flies when you've got the
right equipment!

227
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,993
Hit it, Liz!

228
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,114
All right! Look at those seeds grow!

229
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,430
l hope this seed is an express.

230
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,950
Hang on class. Here we go!

231
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,589
Plant lt! Magazine, here we come!

232
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,788
Ms. Frizzle, can't this seed go any faster?

233
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,995
Not unless we hitch a ride on a dog or a bird
or a mongoose

234
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,354
A mongoose?

235
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,513
Here comes our ride!

236
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:18,956
Oh no! lt's Mr. Seedplot! We can't!

237
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,069
We have to!

238
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,031
We are!

239
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:36,191
We're on Mr. Seedplot's head! HOW
EMBARRASSlNG!

240
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,549
We've got to get off before he sees us!

241
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:01,633
But Phoebe, this is our chance to meet Mr.
Seedplot.

242
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,232
Hey Mr. Seedplot! Up here!

243
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,593
Quiet!! We'll get thrown off!

244
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:13,310
Yes! MR. SEED PLOT!

245
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,839
Hello? Did someone call me?

246
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,153
Phoebe! You did it again!

247
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,993
Hello? Did someone call me?

248
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,159
We're almost there!

249
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,554
We made it!

250
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,392
Oh no!

251
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,954
Now what?

252
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,353
The photographer's here and we're not ready!

253
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,079
You're right, the seed isn't a plant yet.

254
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,072
We need soil and water and light and..

255
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,835
And TlME! TlME for it to sprout and grow and
flower!

256
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,435
And TlME we haven't got... Ms. Frizzle?

257
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:00,237
Okay, Liz, TlME to go to hyper-seed.

258
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,434
Soil

259
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,349
Water

260
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,075
Light

261
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,750
Time

262
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,438
Well, Phoebe, you did it! l see you found a
plant after all.

263
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,478
Where is everybody, anyway?

264
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,269
Ms. Frizzle, stop!

265
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,318
Can we just shrink again?

266
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,197
Phoebe - NOW WHAT?

267
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,352
lf we get big again, Mr. Seedplot will see us!

268
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,193
So??? Phoebe, it's three o-clock!

269
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:47,279
The photographer's here! THlS lS OUR BlG
CHANCE!!!

270
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,712
But what'll Mr. Seedplot think if we just appear,
POOF, out of nowhere?

271
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,394
He'll think we appeared, POOF, out of
nowhere.

272
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,915
Exactly. He'll think we're really WElRD!

273
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,156
He'll think Ms. Frizzle is...

274
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,316
Phoebe, are you embarrassed by Ms. Frizzle?

275
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,116
But Phoebe, think of what she's just done!

276
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:29,348
Ms. Frizzle's the best! Mr. Seedplot can think
what he likes!

277
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,438
Let's get big so l can introduce him to my new
teacher!

278
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,036
Thanks. Are you Mr. Frizzle?

279
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:45,075
No, l'm Mr. Seedplot. Ms. Frizzle doesn't
appear toz. . .

280
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,674
Hello there.

281
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,596
Oh! There they are!

282
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,714
Hello, Phoebe. l brought you a plant,

283
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,877
but l see you already have one.

284
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,948
Thanks so much for bringing it, Mr. Seedplot.

285
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:05,039
And you're right, l have one already. Thanks
to Ms. Frizzle!

286
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,397
Ms. Frizzle! Nice to see you again!

287
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,590
Nice to see you, too, Archibald.

288
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,998
You mean...you know each other?

289
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,595
Sure! l'm one of Ms. Frizzle's biggest fans!

290
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:23,435
And l just love your garden! lt's really magic!

291
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,919
What's your secret?

292
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,392
No secret, Archibald.

293
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:31,314
As l always say the magic is in the gardeners!

294
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,476
All right, everyone, say--

295
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,672
SEEDS

296
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,279
ls it the magic school bus?

297
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,515
ls it the magic school bus?

298
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,438
ls it the magic school bus?

299
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,715
ls it the magic school bus?

300
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,795
ls it the magic school bus?

301
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,399
ls it the magic school bus?

302
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:00,513
stay tune with us and be a smart kid

303
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,834
Dear Valerie... No, no...

304
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,275
Hello, is this the Magic School Bus?

305
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,108
But l don't work here.

306
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:34,917
Hello?

307
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,036
Hello. ls is this the Magic School Bus?

308
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:37,717
Yes, but. . .

309
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,035
Did you work on that show about seeds?

310
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,837
Actually, l was in it.

311
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,428
Then maybe you can answer a few questions.

312
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,509
Well, l'll try.

313
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,832
First of all, why didn't Phoebe just look in a
catalogue and get her seeds from there?

314
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,879
Because seeds don't really come from
catalogs. They come from plants.

315
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,510
True, but how about when Ms. Frizzle
speeded everything up by magic?

316
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,591
l do love her magic.

317
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:06,318
Well they do that on nature programs all the
time. lt's called time lapse photography,

318
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,512
and they use it to show things happening
faster than they really do.

319
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,999
but there some things that just can't be
rushed.

320
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,830
What are you talking about?

321
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,469
Oh, sorry, what was the question?

322
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,750
What kind of plant did Phoebe have anyway?

323
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,317
That was a...er...a Flowering Made-up-icus.

324
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,354
Give me a break. There's no such plant.

325
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,232
Okay, you're right. Phoebe's flower was
invented for the show,

326
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,392
but it's very similar to lots of real flowers.

327
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,438
but one last question.

328
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,873
That's what l'm here for.

329
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,877
Does Ms. Frizzle have a boyfriend?

330
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:49,115
Well...l don't have time to answer that.
Goodbye.

331
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,354
Nice to see you, too, Archibald.

332
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,794
THE END
