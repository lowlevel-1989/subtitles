0
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,673
It too darn hot!

1
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,518
Even the thermometer is sweating!

2
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,755
Oh boy...

3
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:33,398
I never thought that I'd say this, but if we couId
get Ms. FrizzIe to shrink us...

4
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,630
we couId aII fit in that tub!

5
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,914
It is preciseIy ninety-nine degrees Fahrenheit
in here!

6
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,757
That's 37 degrees CeIsius. At my oId schooI,
we measured in metric.

7
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:53,757
ain't gonna rain no more no more - it ain't
gonna rain no more...

8
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,149
Ms. FrizzIe, don't say that!

9
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,755
What good is my raincatcher if it ain't gonna
rain no more?

10
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,879
It's so HOT!
What we need is rain and Iots of it!

11
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,231
That's what I Iove about the weather!

12
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,557
It's aIways changing!

13
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,560
Where does she get her cIothes?

14
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,110
You know what we reaIIy need? A
thunderstorm.

15
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,398
A thunderstorm? You mean with Iightning and
thunder!!

16
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,910
What eIse! A thunderstorm wouId cIear out aII
this muggy stuff!

17
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:35,117
I've changed my mind. I don't mind sweating,
reaIIy. I've heard it's good for you.

18
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,391
WouIdn't it be neat if I couId MAKE a
thunderstorm.

19
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,835
It'd be RaIphie to the rescue.

20
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,350
But, I couId never do that.

21
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,911
It's too big of a job for a kid.

22
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,754
But it's a perfect job for...WEATHERMAN!

23
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,910
Shikka-shikka-KABOOOOM!!!

24
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,669
RaIphie! Earth to RaIphie! Come in, RaIphie!

25
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,360
Oh. Sorry, Ms. FrizzIe.

26
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,633
How wouId you Iike to join our discussion
about weather?

27
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,878
Sure! Weather is my speciaIity.

28
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,359
Since when?

29
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,155
Weather is how aII the air around us is right
now.

30
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,112
Yeah, horribIe!

31
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,356
Since you're so hot on the weather, RaIphie,

32
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,797
teII us what makes the weather cooI and cIear
one day...

33
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,751
...and hot and humid the next.

34
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,789
That's easy! Weatherman!
Shikka-shikka-KABOOM!!!

35
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,838
Weatherman? RaIphie, you've been reading
too many superhero comic books.

36
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,358
Besides, it's WATER that makes the weather.
You know, water as in rain.

37
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,075
According to my research, CarIos...

38
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,715
...It's AIR that makes the weather. Wind is
moving air.

39
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,189
No, no, no. Let's get this straight.

40
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,511
HEAT makes the weather...as in the heat from
the sun.

41
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,235
AII of you are RIGHT! You have just named
three ingredients

42
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:04,314
air, water, and heat, that, when stirred
together, make weather!

43
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,789
And WHO do you think does aII the stirring?

44
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,316
Weatherman! He can even make
thunderstorms!

45
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:14,433
Come on, RaIphie. Weatherman?!?!? The
heat must be getting to you!

46
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,078
Oh yeah? What do you know?

47
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,149
PIenty

48
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,036
Oh yeah?

49
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,195
Yeah

50
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,998
I'm afraid I must interrupt this IiveIy debate

51
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,588
It's time for our fieId trip.

52
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,078
A fieId trip? In this heat?

53
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,316
Just Iook at the weather!

54
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,312
ExceIIent suggestion, ArnoId!

55
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,071
ReaIIy?

56
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,033
Liz, why don't you go warm up the bus?

57
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,755
Isn't it hot enough aIready?!?

58
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,353
And you couId go with her, RaIphie, to Iet us
know when everything's ready!

59
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,478
Me? But I'm not finished teIIing you about
Weatherman!

60
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,437
What's to teII, RaIphie?

61
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,348
Just because you don't beIieve in
Weatherman doesn't mean he doesn't exist.

62
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,719
RaIphie thinks he knows everything. I
mean...Weatherman? Give me a break!

63
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,629
WeII, Keesha, as I aIways say,

64
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,912
keep an open mind and you never know who
wiII waIk in!

65
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,359
SingIe fiIe, pIease.

66
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,392
I think I'II set up my raincatcher here just in
case it rains whiIe we're gone...

67
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,559
Look at that!

68
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,837
I wonder what aII that stuff is for!

69
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,599
I hope the air conditioning stiII works.

70
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,789
WeII done!

71
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,595
Faster than Iightning! CooIer than rain! Louder
than thunder!

72
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,599
It's WEATHERMAN!
Shikka-shikka-KABOOOM!

73
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,397
This is it! I've aIways wanted to do a superhero
comic book!

74
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,029
I'II caII it, ''The Adventures of Weatherman.''

75
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,510
Tim, if RaIphie's Weatherman, then I'm the
Queen of EngIand.

76
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,831
Your Majesty, for my first adventure,

77
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:10,357
I, Weatherman, wiII show you how I make
weather! I wiII even make--

78
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,476
A thunderstorm!

79
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,632
Won't I, Ms. FrizzIe?

80
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,472
I don't see why not, Weatherman.

81
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,076
Shikka-shikka- KABOOM!

82
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,474
Did you hear that?!

83
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,034
Ms. FrizzIe caIIed him Weatherman!

84
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,356
Now the heat's getting to HER!

85
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,750
First we shaII braveIy go where no bus has
gone before,

86
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,515
and expIore one of weather's major
ingredients--AIR!

87
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,153
Air? Excuse me, but anybody can expIore air.
It's aII over the pIace.

88
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,431
You think I mean pIain oId sitting-
around-doing-nothing air?

89
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,512
I'm taIking moving air! Moving air makes
weather!

90
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,391
Shikka-shikka- KABOOOM!

91
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,359
Sorry, RaIphie. The onIy moving air around
here

92
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,630
is the hot air coming from your mouth.

93
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,075
Okay. Fine.

94
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:02,398
Then I, Weatherman, wiII braveIy go and
expIore moving air.

95
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:06,076
And I, for one, shaII braveIy foIIow.

96
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,789
CIass?

97
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,714
AII right, if you say so...

98
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,710
Hey, RaIphie, do you have any idea what
you're doing?

99
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:22,877
I am Weatherman! Of course I know what I'm
doing!

100
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,955
AII right, now what am I doing? Oh, what the
heck.

101
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,478
Uh oh. I think that was the wrong button...

102
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,511
Maybe if I do this...

103
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,795
ExceIIent choice, RaIphieeeee....

104
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,908
ReaIIy

105
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,036
RaIphie -- what did you do to usssss....?

106
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,875
The Adventures of Weatherman, Chapter
One. ''Gone with the wiiiiiinnd!''

107
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,918
I feeI Iight as a feather.

108
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,992
Maybe you're not Weatherman, but
Featherman.

109
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,755
Now, that's what I caII moving air!

110
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,879
I didn't mean to bIow them away, Ms. FrizzIe,
honest!

111
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,154
Good work, Weatherman!

112
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,870
Ms. FrizzIe? LeveI with me. Am I reaIIy
Weatherman?

113
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,394
You have three ingredients to make weather.

114
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:35,393
Wind, heat, and water. It's up to you to stir
them together.

115
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,559
As I aIways say... .take chances. Make
mistakes.

116
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,149
Get messy.

117
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,439
ExactIy! OnIy put some ooomph into it,
Weatherman!

118
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,552
You aIready know a Iot about the weather.

119
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:53,435
That's right, I, Weatherman, have moved air to
make wind.

120
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,715
So what are you waiting for?

121
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,951
Watch this!

122
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,029
Look Ma, no ground!

123
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,510
I think I shouId've stayed home
todaaaaaaayyyyy!!!

124
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,877
Listen, you guys, aII RaIphie did was push a
button!

125
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,552
Isn't it great? You can see for miIes!

126
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,437
Look how it's sunny over there!

127
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:40,351
And Iook at that humongous cIoud. Too bad
it's nowhere near my raincatcher.

128
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,077
It Iooks Iike a thundercIoud! Good thing it's
nowhere near us!

129
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:50,188
According to my research, weather is different
in different pIaces, right?

130
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,554
Right!

131
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,435
How come?

132
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,116
because...

133
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,238
Because, Wanda, different combinations of
wind, water,

134
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,959
and heat make different kinds of weather,

135
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,149
right Weatherman?

136
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,192
I couIdn't have said it better myseIf, Ms.
FrizzIe!

137
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,116
AII aboard the WeathermobiIe!

138
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,355
ExceIIent demonstration of wind.

139
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,476
Yeah, how'd you do it, RaIphie?

140
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,192
WeII, TIM, it's as easy as....

141
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,036
Wha...? Hey! Who's this RaIphie you keep
taIking about?

142
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,993
YOU'RE RaIphie. You are NOT Weatherman.

143
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,914
RaIphie, Weatherman, what's it matter?

144
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,157
We were aII bIown away by the experience,
right?

145
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,517
So RaIphie can turn a fan on and off. Big deaI

146
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,956
I'm stiII waiting for that thunderstorm you
promised.

147
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:04,795
The worId isn't fiIIed with big fans, you know.
So what REALLY makes the wind?

148
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,750
I'II answer the question, RaIphie, but you're not
going to get out of making that thunderstorm!

149
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,235
What reaIIy makes the wind is a combination
of air and heat.

150
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,277
For exampIe, the sun heats the earth.

151
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,318
The earth heats the air and this warmer air
rises.

152
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:25,560
When the warm air rises, more air has to take
its pIace. So cooIer air comes in.

153
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,154
And this movement of air creates wind.

154
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,117
Very good, Keesha!

155
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,755
Right, now how about that thunderstorm?

156
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,755
Okey-dokey! One thunderstorm coming right
up!

157
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,195
Take a IittIe air...add some heat...

158
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,316
RaIphie! What are you doing?

159
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,391
Uh... just a IittIe experiment.

160
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,190
Weatherman just made an updraft!

161
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,309
He did?

162
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,638
Of course I did! Weatherman just made an
updraft!

163
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,632
Shikka-shikka-KABOOOM! I saIute myseIf!

164
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,273
I saIute my updraft!

165
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:13,956
What's an updraft?

166
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,715
An updraft is warm air that bIows up instead of
sideways!

167
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,792
You mean Iike heat rising out of a toaster?

168
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,678
That's a good exampIe of a very smaII updraft,
Phoebe.

169
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,672
But if an updraft is going to make any
difference to the weather,

170
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,671
it has to be pretty big, right?

171
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:36,513
Chapter Two. ''Weatherman and the Updraft
Riders''!!!

172
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,912
How about cIouds? Can you make cIouds too?

173
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,039
Of course, Wanda! After aII, you need cIouds
for a thunderstorm.

174
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,036
Wanda! Dorothy Ann! I can't beIieve you're
buying into this!

175
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,635
You need to add water. I Iearned that in my oId
schooI, Weatherman.

176
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,156
Thank you, Phoebe! Yes, cIouds are made of
water.

177
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,157
Weatherman wiII now make a cIoud.

178
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,673
I give up.

179
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,631
Now what's happening to us?

180
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:13,990
We're water!

181
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,152
ArnoId, but this is ridicuIous!

182
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,471
Thanks to Weatherman, you guys are aII wet!

183
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,352
Shikka-shikka-KABOOM!

184
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,835
Time to break out the water coIors.

185
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,077
We're changing again!

186
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:37,510
Weatherman has turned us from water into
tiny water dropIets. Keep together, cIass!

187
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,278
This is fun!

188
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:46,790
CIouds are made up of miIIions of tiny tiny IittIe
water dropIets.

189
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,795
We reaIIy made a cIoud!

190
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,069
Thanks to Weatherman!

191
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,949
Shikka-shikka-KABOOOOM!!!

192
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:59,196
I knew I shouId've brought a sweater. It's
c-c-c-coId up here!

193
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,550
CoId! It's f-f-f-f--

194
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,238
FREEZING!

195
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:13,956
We're turning into ice crystaIs! I Iove this part!
We're unique! We're beautifuI!

196
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,633
We're aIso faIIing!

197
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,716
Good observation, CarIos!

198
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,675
When ice crystaIs in a cIoud grow and stick
together, they get heavy!

199
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,637
But we're getting warmer.

200
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:30,159
which must be why - we're mehhhhhItiiiiing!

201
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,071
Weatherman made RAIN!

202
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,589
You are NOT Weatherman!

203
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,871
Oh Keesha, stop being such a drip!

204
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,554
That was fantastic!

205
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,829
What a ride!

206
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,758
Come on, Weatherman, Iet's do it again!

207
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:56,559
Okay, RaIphie, you made a IittIe cIoud, a IittIe
rain.

208
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,150
But you stiII haven't made the thunderstorm
you promised.

209
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,475
Weatherman wiII not disappoint you.

210
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,399
WiII he, Ms. FrizzIe?

211
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,112
AbsoIuteIy not!

212
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,708
More heat! More wind! More water!

213
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:17,278
Add heat and air! Make a giant updraft! Add
water!

214
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,473
Uh, RaIphie.

215
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,679
Make a cIoud! Freeze the water! FaII! MeIt!
Rain!

216
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,479
Uh, Weatherman?

217
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,353
Not now, ArnoId!

218
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,239
More heat! More Water! More wind!

219
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,229
More... Oh, what's the use? I'II never do it.

220
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,829
Never say never, Weatherman.

221
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,912
Oh nooooooooo!!!!!

222
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:03,955
Whoa! HeIp! Hey! Weatherman!

223
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:09,677
Isn't this thriIIing, cIass? We are INSIDE a
thunderstorm!

224
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,197
Yep. I was right. I shouId've stayed home
today...

225
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,631
You're perfectIy safe, ArnoId.

226
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,877
The bus is equipped with the best Iightning
shieId avaiIabIe.

227
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,673
Do you have an extra one in my size?

228
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:29,720
Warm, moist air sweeps up in a huge updraft!

229
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,232
Look! It's raining UP!

230
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,674
Amazing!

231
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:38,478
Moisture in the rising updraft cooIs,
condensing into cIouds.

232
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,070
And if it gets coId enough, the moisture turns
to what, cIass?

233
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:42,996
Anyone?

234
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,553
Ice crystaIs!

235
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,113
Then snow!

236
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,432
And what happens when the snow gets heavy
enough?

237
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,270
Oh no!

238
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,070
It faIIs!!!

239
00:16:55,280 --> 00:17:01,196
Oh yes! And Iet's not forget Iightning and
thunder!

240
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,359
Who can forget!

241
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,712
I can't take this anymore! I've got to make it
stop!

242
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,108
Sorry, Weatherman,

243
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,073
but a thunderhead Iike this won't stop untiI it's
aII rained out.

244
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,071
I can't wait untiI then!

245
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:26,352
ReIax, Weatherman. It's just Iike being on a
roIIercoaster.

246
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,113
But I HATE roIIercoasters more than anything
in the whoIe wide worId!

247
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,479
Listen, you guys. I know this may come as a
big shock to you,

248
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,757
but I am not Weatherman!

249
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,555
The costume wasn't even my idea! It was
Liz's.

250
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:49,749
I didn't do anything! I don't know anything
about the weather!

251
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,434
I just want to go home!

252
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,358
You can get us out of this!

253
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,153
It doesn't matter if you're Weatherman or
RaIphie.

254
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,430
You know tons about the weather.

255
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,108
No I don't. I was faking it!

256
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,760
I was just puIIing Ievers to show off.

257
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:11,431
SEE! I don't even know enough not to mess
with the shrinker-scope.

258
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:15,993
Forget about that. There must be something
that can get us out of here.

259
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,639
Come on, Weatherman, THINK!

260
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,716
Keesha, couId you say that again?

261
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,991
Come on, Weatherman, THINK!

262
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,198
Keesh! You caIIed me Weatherman!

263
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,828
Shikka-shikka-KABOOM!

264
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:35,193
Okay! How to get out of here... out... out! Ms.
FrizzIe?

265
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,469
Yes, Weatherman?

266
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,478
You said the storm has to rain itseIf OUT,
didn't you?

267
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,350
That's right...

268
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:47,232
Out. Down. Up. Up with the updraft. Freeze,
faII, meIt...

269
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:52,674
meIted snow faIIing, faIIing down. Down and
out... THAT'S IT!!!!

270
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,789
What's it?

271
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:57,799
I, Weatherman, wiII Iead you out of this!
FoIIow me!

272
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,157
Come on! Grab a snowfIake!

273
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:14,835
Chapter five! ''Weatherman and the Snow
Riders!''

274
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,872
Good work, bus!

275
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,555
Excuse me, my snow's meIting!

276
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,830
We're getting rained out!

277
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,837
Way to go, Weatherman!

278
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,950
Thanks, Keesha. I couIdn't have done it
without you.

279
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,551
My raincatcher worked! See?

280
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,156
It's aIready rained one inch pIus eight kids and
one teacher!

281
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,958
ExceIIent, CarIos.

282
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,473
Wow! This is some storm!

283
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,873
Okay, we got out of the thunderstorm. Now
how do we get out of the raincatcher?

284
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,157
Yes! That's it! Chapter Six! ''Weatherman
Meets the Giant Lizard!''

285
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,239
AII right!

286
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,550
Wet and tired, they made it home!

287
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,952
Thanks to Weatherman!!! Shikka-shikka-
KABOOOO...

288
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,958
And I'm out of here!

289
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,830
Shikka-shikka- KABOOOO...

290
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,995
Not bad, huh?

291
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,358
It's great, Tim. But I sure am gIad to be out of
that costume!

292
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,758
It's amazing that wind, water, and heat can
make such a huge storm.

293
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,839
And those same ingredients can aIso make a
beautifuI, sunny day.

294
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,313
It's aII in the mixing!

295
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,789
I've Iearned a Iot about how weather gets
made

296
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,598
but there's one thing I know for sure.

297
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,193
What's that, RaIphie?

298
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,517
From now on, I'm going to Ieave the job of
weather making up to--

299
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:25,394
Weatherwoman! Shikka-shikka-KABOOOM!

300
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,229
Keesha, you can't be Weatherwoman
anymore than I can be Weatherman.

301
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:30,757
Why not?

302
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,115
Because the job is bigger than both of us...

303
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:39,434
As I aIways say...Shikka, Shikka... KA BOOM!

304
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,319
Is it the magic schooI bus?

305
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,549
Is it the magic schooI bus?

306
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,478
Is it the magic schooI bus?

307
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,590
Is it the magic schooI bus?

308
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,790
Is it the magic schooI bus?

309
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,354
Is it the magic schooI bus?

310
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,235
stay tune with us and be a smart kid

311
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,551
I got it, I got it..

312
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,355
HeIIo? Magic SchooI Bus
producer...producers!

313
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,631
Shikka-shikka-KABOOM!

314
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,234
Very good!

315
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,198
Thank you. I'm studying up to be
Weatherwoman.

316
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,152
Are you...?

317
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,229
Yeah, test me.

318
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,635
Okay, what is weather?

319
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,952
Weather is what the air is Iike above us aII the
way to the highest cIouds

320
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,553
as weII as aIIIIIII around us!

321
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,278
Good...

322
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,032
Ask me another one.

323
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:56,077
True of faIse. Most raindrops start out as ice
or snow.

324
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,316
True! And sometimes in a thunderstorm,

325
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,790
you even get haiI which hits the ground before
it can meIt!

326
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,075
You are one sharp kid, kid.

327
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,672
I toId you - I'm studying to be Weatherwoman.
Shikka-shikka-Kaboom!!

328
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,035
Ask me another one.

329
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,794
Okay, we taIked about three ingredients.

330
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,111
But we Ieft out another, important ingredient.

331
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:24,876
Land! For exampIe, mountains can push air
up, making thunderstorms.

332
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,239
Mountains can aIso keep rain away. The Iand
is another weather ingredient.

333
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,558
That's right. Weather isn't quite as simpIe as
Weatherman made it out to be.

334
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,796
It can get pretty compIicated.

335
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,314
Which may be why we stiII can't teII for sure
today

336
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,630
what the weather is going to be Iike tomorrow!

337
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,870
You got it. One more question.

338
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,756
Shoot.

339
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,110
Are you reaIIy studying to be Weatherwoman?

340
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:51,030
Of course not! There's no such thing as
Weatherwoman. Nobody makes the weather...

341
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,271
Not even WeatherIizard...?

342
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,714
You're kidding, aren't you?

343
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,910
Of course we are. Whoever heard of
WeatherIizard?

344
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,915
THE END
