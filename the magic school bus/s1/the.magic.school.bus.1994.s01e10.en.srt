0
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,513
Okay. This is it. Tie game.

1
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,795
Bottom of the ninth. Bases loaded.

2
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,758
All you gotta do is slam the ball over the left
field fence...

3
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,274
and win the seventh game of the World
Series!

4
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,915
Ral...phie! Ral...phie! Ral...phie!

5
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,994
Ralphie! Ralphie! Wake up! Ralphie, you're
up.

6
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,914
Oh right, Keesha. l knew that.

7
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,555
Hey, Wanda! Where's home plate?

8
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,035
There isn't one, Ralphie. Just pretend.

9
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,957
Pretend?? Me??!!

10
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,838
But l'll have nothing to slide into when l hit a
home run!

11
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,709
You'll have nothing to hit, if you don't let me
pitch.

12
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,232
Oh, all right. l'll pretend...

13
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,150
Hey you guys! Check this out!

14
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,513
l just found out the coolest thing!

15
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,160
Psst, Liz. Come here.

16
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:10,360
Dorothy Ann! Not now! l'm one swing away
from hitting my way into the record books.

17
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,399
But you've got to see this! lt'll change your
lives!!

18
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,110
Whatever it is, it can't be more important than
our baseball game.

19
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,591
l just finished this book! ''A Child's Garden of
Physics!

20
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,838
l'm really happy for you DA.

21
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,110
We can't wait to hear the book report.

22
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,999
But right now, l've got a game-winning homer
to hit...

23
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,798
So if you could just get off the field.

24
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,718
But Ralphie! You don't understand!

25
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:44,078
This book's all about what gets things moving,
and what makes them stop!

26
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,714
Forces! Friction! Pushes! Pulls!

27
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,637
Forces?

28
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,237
Friction?

29
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:48,792
Pushes?

30
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,591
Pulls?

31
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,510
And as l always say, where there's physics,
there's a field trip!

32
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,468
Listen! A force is just a push or a pull.

33
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,160
lf you're going to FORCE us to listen to this...

34
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,959
You're being kinda PUSHY, don't you think?

35
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:12,234
No, no, l'm talking about REAL force. Picture
this...

36
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,954
There's this big red sled sitting in the snow

37
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,477
not going anywhere. But if somebody comes
along and gives it a push

38
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,476
Who?

39
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,116
lt doesn't matter, Arnold. lf somebody comes
and--

40
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,993
l need to know so l can complete my mental
picture.

41
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,957
Yeah, me too!

42
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,475
Okay, okay. How about--

43
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,755
Napoleon!

44
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:38,029
Fine. lf Napoleon comes along and gives the
sled a push,

45
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,315
it'll move! That's a force!

46
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:45,116
And it'll keep moving on the slippery snow until
something stops it...

47
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,236
Like the entire British army?

48
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,076
No, like...some dirt!

49
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,237
Things rubbing together cause a force called
FRlCTlON.

50
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,910
The sled stops because of the friction of the
dirt against the runners.

51
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,955
Friction slows down and stops nearly every
motion on earth!

52
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,760
You stopped our game to tell us THAT?

53
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,637
lsn't that cool!

54
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,070
Let us know when they make the movie, okay
DA!

55
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,116
Very funny, you guys..

56
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,959
Well, l think friction is fascinating!

57
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,237
Well l think it's...hey...

58
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,676
Dorothy Ann! Wait!

59
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,231
You know, that book does sound sort of cool..

60
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,999
lt is! And look at this, Ralphie!!

61
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,317
Page 97!

62
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,789
Hey! lt's a baseball field!

63
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,597
But it would be impossible to play normal
baseball there! There's no friction!

64
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,195
You know, Dorothy Ann, this is one amazing
book.

65
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,831
Flat. Sturdy. White and the right size.

66
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,435
Gee, D.A...d'you think maybe l
could...BORROW it??

67
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,552
Sure! But you have to promise to take care of
it!!

68
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,432
A scout's honor.

69
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,749
You're up, Ralphie.

70
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,034
Thanks, D.A.!

71
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,998
All aboard!

72
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,873
Now? But... but, Ms. Frizzle

73
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,755
we're in the middle of the most important
competition in the history of sports.

74
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,672
Just a delay of game, Ralphie.

75
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,832
Delay of game? What for?

76
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,754
Field trip delay! lt's time to explore the
unknown!

77
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,394
Be adventurous, brave and bold!

78
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:31,956
Let's go!

79
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,598
Field trip!?

80
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:45,471
Just so long as we don't get blasted, roasted,
toasted, or eaten...l'm happy!!

81
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,317
Don't worry, Arnold. That's not until next
week.

82
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,236
Today we're going to a baseball game!

83
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,275
All right!

84
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,674
This is so cool!

85
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:01,834
A baseball game? That's not new or different
or exciting...

86
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,559
What!?!

87
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,269
Let's go someplace REALLY unusual...

88
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,677
like that place l showed you, Ralphie!

89
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,634
You know. Page 97? Show them...!

90
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,640
yeah...well, uh...

91
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,031
Ralphie! How could you?

92
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,190
Well...you know, it was the right size

93
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,472
and with the white cover and all, it made a
great home plate...

94
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,029
Hey, it's not like l RUlNED it!

95
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,989
Please, Ms. Frizzle, can we get my book
before we go?

96
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,588
No occasion for agitation, Dorothy Ann.

97
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,957
We'll not only get your book, we'll keep
Ralphie happy, too...

98
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:41,910
We will?

99
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,829
Bus, do your stuff!

100
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,191
Time to hit the books!

101
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,549
Let me get the facts. Are we where l think we
are?

102
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,472
Yes! Yes! We are.

103
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,794
At my old school, the librarian never let us
drive in our books.

104
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,071
Ms Frizzle!! Stop here! Please!

105
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,673
Page 97!

106
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:31,034
lt's the page l was talking about! lt's all about
a World Without Friction!!

107
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,915
lt looks like the world of baseball to me! Come
on.

108
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:44,918
Ralphie, watch out! The ground on that field's
got NO FRlCTlON!

109
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,078
l can't stop...!

110
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,993
Wow! lt's Ralphie the runaway pinball!

111
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,111
Yep, there's no stopping him now.

112
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,073
Without friction, how ARE we going to stop
him?!

113
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,470
What would happen if something smashed
into him?

114
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,597
Right, a force pushing the other way!!

115
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,953
But what can we use? The only forces we can
control in there are...

116
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,433
...us!!

117
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:22,359
Take me out of the friction, where things just
slow to a stop...

118
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,638
This way class.

119
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,676
Something tells me l should have stayed home
today.

120
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,799
Oh no, what should l do now!?

121
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,999
l wonder what would happen if l tried to run...

122
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,157
Not a good idea!!

123
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,556
Oh boy, is this ever weird.

124
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,631
l can't...walk...l need something to push
against...

125
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,078
like the friction of my feet against the ground!!

126
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,549
These feet were made for friction!

127
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,357
Forget walking, l just want to stand up.

128
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,831
How about a force to get you going Dorothy
Ann?! Like a...push?

129
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,949
Never fear, Ralphie!! A PUSH to the rescue!!

130
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,634
There. l saved you.

131
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,918
Saved me?? l was having a blast!!

132
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,476
Hey, DA, looks like Ralphie gave you the push
off!

133
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,391
That's the last time l save HlM! Whoo!

134
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,159
Whew...that was close...

135
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,438
Look on the bright side, Arnold. No friction, no
grass stains.

136
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,553
Okay, hit it Liz!

137
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,039
Now what??

138
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:32,389
Hello, sports fans! Welcome to the All Frizzle
Friction Free Baseball Classic!

139
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,239
And what a beautifully frictionless day it is!

140
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,194
Ms Frizzle, where did you learn to announce
like that?

141
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,193
You'd be surprised what teachers do during
the summer break...

142
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,276
but lets talk about the game, D.A.

143
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,756
Oh yes. Well, folks, believe it or not,

144
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:51,674
we're coming to you live from inside my
textbook!!

145
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:56,794
Our playing field today is slipperyer than ice
and slicker than spit.

146
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,350
The ground out there has NO, we repeat, NO
FRlCTlON!

147
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,510
Yessiree baseball fans,

148
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:10,509
this could very well be this week's Game of the
Century!

149
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,429
On the mound is Wanda, one of the most
outstanding pitcher in the class..

150
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,478
and master of the famed Bubblegum Ball...!

151
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,795
You ready for this, Ralphie?

152
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,273
Try me!

153
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:26,548
First up is Ralphie, the most fearsome
four-foot hitter in the league!

154
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,596
And there's the pitch!

155
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,554
And look at that, folks!! The force Wanda used
really got that ball going!

156
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,989
and her pushed her way backwards!

157
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,470
lt's a swing and a miss!

158
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,957
Sorry, Ms. Frizzle.

159
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,794
a serious catcher-teacher hip check!!

160
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,233
What is going on here?

161
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,475
Another pitch...this one looks good..

162
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,636
A hot grounder down the third base line!

163
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,957
But, Dorothy Ann, what do you think has
happened to our batter...?

164
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,234
This isn't fu-uh-uh-unny!

165
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,998
He's spinning off to first!

166
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,749
Yes! Yes! Ralphie is going for the double with
a spin-on-it!

167
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,108
Oh dear...!

168
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,038
Just look at that ball go folks!!

169
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,435
That's what happens when there's no friction
from the ground to slow it down!!

170
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,830
And look at Ralphie go!

171
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,913
Oh no! Double play!

172
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,436
Okay, l'll play second.

173
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,431
lt's all yours!

174
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,875
Coming through...!

175
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,197
Then again, maybe l'll back Tim up in center.

176
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,673
Look out!

177
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:45,393
ls this baseball or BASHBALL?

178
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,151
Holy cow! Where have all the infielders
gone??

179
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,314
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh my sto-om-a-a-ach!

180
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,748
Comin' home!!

181
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,030
And what a throw!! lt's going to be close!!

182
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,115
Will Ralphie remember that no friction means
NO SLOWlNG DOWN!?!

183
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,556
Missed me!

184
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:09,076
ls it just me, or are we going to collllliiiiiiiide!

185
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,632
Do l look like home plate?

186
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,877
lf you're home plate, l must be...SAFE!

187
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:19,873
l guess baseball isn't exactly field trip
material--

188
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,028
The lack-of-friction was the big pain!!

189
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:29,119
Pain?? l can't believe you failed to see the
wonder

190
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,798
of a World Without Friction!

191
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,077
l'd trade all the wonder in the world for box
seats--

192
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,272
which we might've had if it weren't been for
your goofy book!!

193
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,355
Ms Frizzle?

194
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,754
Yes, Dorothy Ann?

195
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,993
l think we better call this game ''Too Lack of
Friction''.

196
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,835
Game!! Hiddit' again Liz.

197
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,874
Grab on, class!!

198
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,750
Oh yeah??

199
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,557
Yeah!!

200
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,715
Well sez you!!

201
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:18,996
Sez you!!

202
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,030
Sez you!!

203
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:20,632
Yeah!!

204
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:28,589
All right! lt's the All Frizzle Friction Free
TUG-A-WAR!

205
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,749
Then again...maybe not.

206
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,279
Very good, Wanda!

207
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:38,588
A PUSH is ONE force that can get us moving.
What's the opposite?

208
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,830
A pull?

209
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,308
A PULL!!!

210
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,553
Right.

211
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,752
This is more like it.

212
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,273
Thanks bus.

213
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,398
Wait a sec...where is everybody??

214
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,792
Grab on, you guys.

215
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,552
Pull! Pull! Pull!

216
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,390
Wow, you were right D.A. We had no idea
friction did so much!!

217
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,152
Dorothy Ann, could l borrow that book when
Ralphie's done with it?

218
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,116
C'n l, too?

219
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,110
Then me!!

220
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,631
Wait a sec! No one GETS the book until we
get OUT of it!!

221
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,749
He's got a point.

222
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,949
l guess so.

223
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,117
To the bus!

224
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,874
ls everyone seated?

225
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,479
Yes, Ms Frizzle.

226
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,272
Then let's book it!!

227
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,431
Uh oh, what was that?

228
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,668
At my old school, we only pressed FLOWERS
in our books.

229
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,070
Any suggestions class?

230
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,713
Better gun it, Ms. Frizzle...

231
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,149
Excellent idea, Wanda!

232
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,714
Oh no!! The cover of the book is pushing down
on the bus

233
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:15,276
too hard for the wheels to push us out!!!

234
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,959
What???

235
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,271
WE'RE STU UH UH UH UH...UH UH UCK!!!

236
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,677
l can't believe this!! We're stuck in Dorothy
Ann's book!!

237
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,995
What'll happen to us if we can't get out?

238
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,276
Guess we'll be food for the BOOKworms.

239
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,518
CARLOS!

240
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,558
This is serious!

241
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,188
l know, a real HEAVY situation.

242
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,720
As l always say, those who are book bound

243
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,518
should take a look around!

244
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,796
Stay on the same page, please!

245
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,871
Step on it, Liz!

246
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,917
There's not enough friction down here to push
the bus out!

247
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,589
There's too much friction up here!

248
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,349
Okay, okay, where do we stand?

249
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,072
Somewhere between page 96 and 97.

250
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,474
CARLOS!

251
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,429
Hey, just trying to lighten things up.

252
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,078
Lighten things up, that's it!

253
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,794
We climb up on the roof and PUSH UP on the
book!

254
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,350
Let me get the facts. You're saying we should
hold up the book

255
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,596
get in the bus and drive away?

256
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,590
Yes!

257
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,511
How?

258
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,315
Good question, Arnold. Anyone have an
answer?

259
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,119
DA, this is ALL YOUR FAULT!!

260
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,550
Ralphie, you're a genius!

261
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:53,390
Look! The letters peel off the page! l HAVE A
PLAN!!

262
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,795
We split into two teams, right?

263
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,716
Right

264
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,755
Ralphie's team goes on the roof and pushes
up on the book...

265
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,429
...while my team piles letters up under here to
hold the book up

266
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,551
long enough for us to get out!

267
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,274
Like this.

268
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,115
Exactly.

269
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,838
Let's do it!

270
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,319
Let-'er rip!

271
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,273
Carlos, take a letter!

272
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,072
Excellent plan. But why doesn't YOUR team
push up on the book

273
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,509
while MY team piles the letters? Okay? Okay!

274
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,635
Not okay!

275
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,875
Yes okay!

276
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,637
Not!

277
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,476
Yes okay!

278
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,436
Not!

279
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,388
Um, D.A...what is it again that makes
everything stop??

280
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,236
Friction...

281
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,679
And if there's a lot of it you can't really get
anywhere, right, Ralphie?

282
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,869
Yes...

283
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,510
Well, l think there's a little too MUCH friction
between you two.

284
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,677
So if we're ever going to get out of this book...

285
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,598
We'd better get rid of the friction between us.

286
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,516
Sorry.

287
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,392
No, l'm sorry.

288
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,755
Well, l'm even sorrier.

289
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,798
No l'm sorrier...

290
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,076
No l'm sorrier...

291
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,311
And l'm sorrier than both of you.

292
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,192
Ok, let's do it!

293
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,878
C'mon, we gotta make it!

294
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,912
Almost there, we need some more words.

295
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,515
Out of the book, and through the words, back
to class we go...

296
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,871
An open and shut case!

297
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,236
CARLOS!

298
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,515
Hang on, Ralphie. Remember what happened
last time you jumped out of the bus like that...

299
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,472
Never fear, there's friction HERE!

300
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,272
Good old friction!

301
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,718
Hey there, friction fans!

302
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,236
Welcome to the All Frizzle
Complete-With-Friction Baseball Classic!!

303
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,559
Yessirree, it's a bee-yootiful day here at
Frizzle Field

304
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,796
and have we got a game for you!!

305
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,956
The first up is our very own Dorothy Ann.

306
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:35,430
l tell you, Keesha, if she hits the BALL as hard
as she hits the BOOKS

307
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,358
waaattch out!

308
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,632
Ohh! A tremendous hit, deep into center!

309
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,395
Holy Cow! She exerted some kinda force on
that ball!!

310
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,516
BUT can the left fielder, Carlos

311
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,114
get to that ball and apply HlS force to stop it?

312
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,232
No he can't!! What a shot, folks!!

313
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:03,960
But lucky for Carlos, the friction of the ball
against the grass has slowed it to a stop!!

314
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,554
What WOULD we do without friction, folks?

315
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,635
C'mon.

316
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,958
And D.A. finds a friend in friction as she slides
home!

317
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,232
The big question! ls she safe or out!?!

318
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,716
l don't know, Keesha, l can't make out the
plate!!!

319
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,996
That's funny... neither can l...

320
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,109
Where is it??

321
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,599
l think it's over there!

322
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,559
DA was right...this book is GREAT!!

323
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:34,714
As l always say, Ralphie, never judge a book
by its cover.

324
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,114
ls it the magic school bus?

325
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,355
ls it the magic school bus?

326
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,193
ls it the magic school bus?

327
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,469
ls it the magic school bus?

328
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,629
ls it the magic school bus?

329
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,279
ls it the magic school bus?

330
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,439
stay tune with us and be a smart kid

331
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,916
Hey, Liz. Another day, another----caller.

332
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,235
Now WHO could that be?

333
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,715
Hello? magic school bus's producer speaking.

334
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,837
Hi, you know that textbook the bus and the
kids went inside?

335
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,712
Wonderful book, isn't it?

336
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,035
Yeah, l'd like to know where l can get a copy.

337
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,071
So you can visit a world without friction?

338
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,912
Right. l already checked the library.

339
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,395
Where did you look?

340
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,437
ln the non-friction section, of course.

341
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,593
Actually, you can find non-friction anywhere.

342
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,359
But here on earth, l thought friction was the
only game in town.

343
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:52,276
lt is, but you'd be surprised how many ways
we can give friction the slip.

344
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,078
You mean, like sliding down a slide?

345
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,596
Yes, very little friction, but lots of fun.

346
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,874
Or playing shuffleboard.

347
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,759
Oh wait, of course.

348
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,315
lce skating. She shoots! She scores!

349
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,029
Snow skiing?

350
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,399
and more skiing.

351
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,755
Snow swimming.

352
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,795
Skate boarding.

353
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,477
Oh! And don't forget, log rolling.

354
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,593
Very non-frictional.

355
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,709
So friction is all around us, but sometimes
there's just less of it.

356
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,189
Exactly

357
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,954
And sometimes a lack of friction can surprise
you.

358
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,556
Yes, l suppose it could surprise
Yoooooooowhhaaaaaa!!

359
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,390
Thanks! Non-friction is my favorite.

360
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:53,758
Sometimes working on this show is stranger
than friction.

361
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,908
THE END
