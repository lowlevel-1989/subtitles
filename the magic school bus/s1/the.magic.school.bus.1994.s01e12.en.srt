0
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,713
Bees! We want bees!

1
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,273
Put it over here!

2
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,116
Hold it everybody, hold it!

3
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,669
lt's JUST a science fair.

4
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,990
Just a science fair?

5
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,676
Too bad we can't use last year solar powered
juggling machine.

6
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,356
Nice try, Ralphie, but it doesn't fit with this
year's theme...animals that live together.

7
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,199
And l quote from the entry form...

8
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,672
''Some animals live alone, but some live and
work together in groups, called communities.''

9
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,035
Watch your back! Heads up! Comin' through!

10
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,596
l'm escorting an important visitor to our
classroom.

11
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,119
Make way for...

12
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,428
Hello, class!

13
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,877
Ms. Frizzle! You almost stepped on our
visitor.

14
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,359
Oh, my!

15
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,113
WHAT visitor?

16
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,799
My friend, the ant!

17
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:55,629
Look at her go! lsn't she amazing? l wonder
where she's headed...

18
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,996
Don't worry, little ant. Wherever you're going,
l'll make sure you get there.

19
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:06,349
No time for ANTics, Keesha. We've got to
pick a project for the science fair.

20
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,588
Ah, the passion of science.

21
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,509
Now Liz, do you have any idea where l put that
camera?

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,353
There it is.

23
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,435
My ant? Where's my ant?

24
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,958
Keesha, YOUR ant is eating MY
Mallow-Blaster!

25
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,398
So that's why she came in here! She was
looking for food!

26
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,156
Don't worry little ant, Arnold's more than happy
to share his Mallow-Blaster.

27
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,315
Keesha, are you going to baby-sit that ant all
day, or...

28
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,877
Hey! Maybe we could do something about my
ant for the science fair!

29
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,832
According to my research, where you find one
ant there's usually more.

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,710
That's right, Dorothy Ann. Ants live together in
nests.

31
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,917
But what could we do with ants? A mural? A
model?

32
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,310
Careful with that camera, Liz.

33
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,110
At my old school, lizards weren't allowed to
make movies.

34
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,112
That's it! We'll make a MOVlE!

35
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,678
She's a natural star!

36
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,634
l can see it all now...we'll call it ''Travels with
my Ant.''

37
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,076
A movie about an ant...

38
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,674
You know something? That's not a bad idea...

39
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,951
No, it's a good idea! A GREAT idea!

40
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,918
Yes!! Let's make a movie!

41
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,154
l'll write it! lt'll be all about an ant with a long
nose called elephANT! Get it?

42
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,554
CARLOS!!

43
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,232
Can l help write it too?

44
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,952
You can write it together.

45
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,593
What about us?

46
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,030
You can all be lN it, and play ants!

47
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:42,837
What are my lines?

48
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,875
Who's the star?

49
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,279
My ant, of course!

50
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,394
lf you're going to direct this movie, Keesha,
you might need this.

51
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,313
Me direct it? But l thought you--

52
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,839
lt was your idea.

53
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,638
Oh wow? Oh boy! l'm the director! The
whole films depends on me!

54
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,678
As l always say, Keesha...ACTlON!

55
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,432
How could she do that?

56
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,712
Ms. Frizzle, you could do the costumes.

57
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,558
Thank you, Carlos.

58
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,917
Okay now, people, this is...

59
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:13,916
Keesha...?

60
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,838
ln a minute, Phoebe.
This is what l want you to do.

61
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,311
Follow that camera lizard!

62
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,870
Great Liz! A little tighter.

63
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,311
ANTS! But which one's mine?

64
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,437
Look at them all! Where are they going?

65
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,275
Guys. Can we go back in now? l just know
it's going to rain.

66
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,075
Not until l find my ant, Arnold! She's my star

67
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,752
and now l lost her.

68
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,239
According to my research

69
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,916
your star's been telling the other ants in its
nest about Arnold's Mallow- Blaster.

70
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,233
Excellent observation, Dorothy Ann.

71
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,393
Ants don't actually talk to each other, but they
do communicate.

72
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,994
l got it! lt's a Western

73
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,280
starring an ant that rounds up food, see, and
then tells the rest of the ants where it is.

74
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,239
That's good, Ralphie! That's good! We'll call
it ''Food Dude.''

75
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:27,275
Excellent Carlos. An ant whose job it is to find
food is a forager ant.

76
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,429
Food dude is a wonderful name for Keesha's
ant.

77
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,920
Ms. Frizzle? Are we going on a field trip?

78
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,557
Very observANT, Arnold!

79
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,990
ObservANT! l like it, l like it a lot!

80
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,475
ls that her? ls that my ant?

81
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,198
l don't think so, Keesha.

82
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,630
Director to bus, please. Director to bus.

83
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,309
Oh, bad. Oh bad, bad, bad!

84
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,870
Ms. Frizzle, we've lost her! We've lost our
star!

85
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,594
l can't do a movie without a star!

86
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,276
Right you are, Keesha! She's one in a million!

87
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,636
Seatbelts, everyone! Here we go!

88
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,998
Again!

89
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,315
But we're shrinking!

90
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,669
l feel like we're on the inside of a mini
Mallow-Blaster...

91
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,438
We are!

92
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,395
Hey! We're being foraged!

93
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,275
l thought we were going to play ants - not food.

94
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,749
l knew l should've stayed home today...

95
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,997
Giant potato chip being foraged straight
ahead.

96
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,188
So, uh, Keesha? ls the movie going to star a
forager ant?

97
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,198
And are WE going to co-star as the food?

98
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,151
Ms. Frizzle, l'm really sorry

99
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,993
but l don't think this movie should star a
forager ant.

100
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,590
Got that, Carlos? Not about a forager ant...

101
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,477
Why not? That's what your ant is!

102
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,910
l know, Carlos, but l've been thinking.

103
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,795
l want more drama - more excitement!

104
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,000
l wish you hadn't said that...

105
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,960
Where are we?

106
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,393
An anthill!

107
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:13,996
Ms. Frizzle! We're on location! This is
perfect!

108
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,791
We'll meet the ants, up close and personal!
Now l'll find my star!

109
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,271
Okay, people! This movie is my
responsibility...

110
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,234
so l will check out the anthill and then tell you
what to do next!

111
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,514
Come on, Liz!

112
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,189
RUN!!!!

113
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,630
Good opening sequence, Keesha! lt really
grabbed me! Did you get it, Liz?

114
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:54,113
What's with those gigantic ants? Who let
them on the set?

115
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,754
We're on location, Keesha. Remember?

116
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,879
They look like they're guarding the nest or
something. Don't they, Carlos?

117
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,276
Cool! Keesha, the movie could star a guard
ant!

118
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,828
l don't know Ralphie...

119
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,509
Come on Keesha. We can call it ''The
Guardfather''.

120
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,309
Perfect for the wide screen with stereo sound
and...

121
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,034
And smell-o-vision!

122
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,399
Smell-o-vision?

123
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,560
Guard ants use their antennae to smell if
we're friend or foe.

124
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,834
They are smelling us.

125
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,758
Precisely, Tim. Ants don't understand words,
but they do understand smells.

126
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,158
They're checking to see if we smell like them.

127
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:42,956
Yeah, they want to know if we're wearing the
same deodorANT!

128
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,957
CARLOS!

129
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,795
No, no! lt's a great joke! lt's going in...

130
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,434
Ants don't wear deodorant, Carlos.

131
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,314
But their bodies do make scented chemicals
called pheromones.

132
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,628
Pheromones?

133
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,711
Pheromones!

134
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,190
lt tickles! What is this stuff?

135
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,909
Well, class, we now smell like these ants.

136
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,115
We do?

137
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,035
Uh huh! And now the guard ants will let us into
the nest.

138
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,154
As l always say, when visiting a nest, smell
like the rest!

139
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:23,034
l smell like an ant - just what l always wanted.

140
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,431
Really, Ralphie? Me too!

141
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,155
Oh boy!

142
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,035
One good smell deserves another!

143
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,873
Excuse me!

144
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,955
That tickles!

145
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,115
Cool!

146
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,273
Come on, Liz. We've got to get in there and
find our star!

147
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,679
Wait for us!

148
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,639
OK Phoebe, what do we have so far?

149
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:58,038
Well, this movie is NOT about a forager ant or
a guard ant.

150
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,557
So, what lS it about, Keesha? We can't write
this script without a star!

151
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,393
Let me think...

152
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:10,669
Don't worry, everybody - it's all part of the
creative process -- she's thinking of a story.

153
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,835
Check it out!!!

154
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,358
Where are they going?

155
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,149
Man, it must be rush hour.

156
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,153
Look, Keesha, a cast of thousands.

157
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,754
OKAY! Places everyone.

158
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,314
Where do you want us, Keesha?

159
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:37,757
What about make-up, Keesha? l don't look
anything like these ants!

160
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,912
And what's the plot, Keesha? Who's the star?

161
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,349
l'm working on it! l'm working on it!

162
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,278
Who knew so many ants would audition?

163
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,679
Um, Keesha? Maybe it would help if we
worked with the ants - got to know them better.

164
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,194
We're not going inside an ant are we?

165
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,108
No, Arnold. But Phoebe's right.

166
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,198
Understanding begins with observation.

167
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,840
Good idea, Phoeb! Method acting! l love it!

168
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:08,552
Okay, everyone! SEE the ant, FEEL the ant,
BE the ant! ACTlON!

169
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,151
This ant's rubbing its head.

170
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,037
And this one's licking itself.

171
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,794
That's it, Arnold, BE the ant.

172
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,031
But l did this today already...in the shower.

173
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,628
Hey, maybe the ants are cleaning themselves.

174
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,275
Tim, your logic is spotless.

175
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,119
Yuck! These 2 are kissing.

176
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:32,758
Keesha, l've got it! The movie's a
Rome-ANTS! Get it? RomANCE!

177
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,036
CARLOS!

178
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,918
These ants aren't kissing at all.

179
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,151
Yeah, it looks like that ant is giving the other
ant something.

180
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,511
Oh sure, give it back to me AFTER you've
chewed it.

181
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,789
What is it?

182
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,395
Mallow-blaster. l recognize it in any form.

183
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,399
So these ants are passing FOOD around!

184
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:56,634
Cool! A food-passing ant would make a great
star! Think of the story!

185
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,955
l have, Carlos, and it doesn't work.

186
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,918
One day, an ant passed food to another ant.

187
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,435
lt just doesn't feel complete somehow...

188
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,839
Come on, Keesha - we need a star!

189
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,676
Hey, the star could be the presidANT. Get it?
PresidANT?

190
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,956
CARLOS! STOP!

191
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:22,513
l know we need a star, Carlos! l just haven't
seen the right aaaaaa...!

192
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,551
Everyone, Stay with your partner!

193
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,676
Help!

194
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,592
Not so fast!

195
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,592
Keep shooting, Liz!

196
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,514
After those ants, people! lt's a great chase
scene!

197
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,557
Wait a minute - what's in here?

198
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,433
AND...Chase scene. Take 1 !

199
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,195
Hey! Where are you guys going?

200
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,112
What are they carrying?

201
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,872
They're like little worms!

202
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:04,715
Cut! No worms! This movie is about an ANT!

203
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,713
Why do you keep giving things to ME? Do l
look like an ant?

204
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:12,355
l don't know, Arnold, but you look like you're
holding a baby.

205
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,394
Maybe it lS a baby...a baby ant!

206
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,274
Well done, Phoebe! They're baby ants, all
right.

207
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,354
When they hatched from eggs, they're called
larvae.

208
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,113
That's it! ''Larvae: The Beginning''.

209
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,835
But who ever heard of a movie about larvae?

210
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,758
l don't know, Keesha. l think it has potential.

211
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,233
l think it's cute.

212
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,791
But all they do is wiggle! There's no drama!
No action!

213
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,879
The ants are moving the larvae around. How's
that for action?

214
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,913
And WHY are they moving them? How's that
for mystery?

215
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,993
Hey, l bet they're trying to keep the larvae
WARM!

216
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,155
Exactly, Tim.

217
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,791
Nurse ants move the young around the nest to
keep them the right temperature.

218
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,798
My aunt's a nurse!

219
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,198
l've got it! l've got it! We could call it
FlorANTS Nightingale!

220
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,473
Cut!!!

221
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,993
Now what, Keesha?

222
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,553
lt's a really good idea and everything

223
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:15,231
but somehow it isn't enough. Where's the
danger? The intrigue?

224
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,436
Hey, WHAT are those things??

225
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:23,795
Hey, wait! Wait!! l didn't say ACTlON!
People! People! What are you doing?

226
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,316
Pupae! These things are called Pupae.

227
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,752
Come on, pupae, l mean people! Look at it!

228
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:35,913
Do you really want to make a movie starring a
PUPAE!

229
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,120
Pupa, actually, only one is called a pupa.
Pupae is plural.

230
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,112
Pupae, Pupa, whatever!

231
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:48,512
Pretty exciting story if you ask me. lt would
make a great documANTary.

232
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,558
Documentary? No way, Carlos!

233
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:55,918
Mr. Cud's class did a documentary last year
on cows, remember?

234
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,911
Just to keep you up to date, Keesha,

235
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:03,751
we're NOT doing a movie about a forager ant,
a guard ant, a nurse ant, a larva or a pupa.

236
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,035
Keesha! There aren't any ants left!

237
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,674
Well then, how about an egg?

238
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,718
Oh no! An egg! That's even worse.

239
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,918
Um, Ms. Frizzle. Where do ant eggs come
from anyway?

240
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:21,598
Good question, Phoebe! The eggs came from
the queen.

241
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,150
The queen? Ms. Frizzle! You're a genius!

242
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:32,669
Carlos, the queen is the perfect star!!! Think of
the story - a royal exclusive!

243
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,916
You're right! lt's gold!

244
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,873
Come on, what are we waiting for? Let's go!

245
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,949
Which way?

246
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,428
lt's the creative process again...

247
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,799
thataway!

248
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,670
Excuse me, Ms Director? ls water supposed
to be coming through the walls like that?

249
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:03,917
After the tunnel caves in, you will see some of
the most amazing ant activity yet!

250
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,350
Did you say, After the tunnel caves in...?

251
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,598
All right, class! Duck and cover!

252
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:21,273
And...CUT! Okay people, don't panic. l'll have
you out of here in....Whoa!

253
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,112
Look at these ants go!

254
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,554
They're repairing the nest! Like construction
workers.

255
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,993
Right, Tim. That's their job. They're builder
ants.

256
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,479
Keesha! We have GOT to do this movie about
a builder ant!

257
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,558
Look at the action! The drama! The
excitement!

258
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,279
Yeah, but which builder ant, Tim?

259
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,191
Well...just pick one.

260
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:48,398
The queen is the star. Know why? Because
there is only one.

261
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,037
But...

262
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,829
Trust me on this. l'm the director, remember?
To the queen!

263
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,837
This must be it, Keesha! Are you excited?

264
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,675
You bet, Phoebe! This movie is going to have
everything -

265
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:06,311
action, drama, excitement - and most of all a
REAL STAR!

266
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,868
Quick! Quick! Go in and bow to the queen!

267
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,873
Ask her who her agent is, the queen is very
importANT.

268
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,389
Maybe so, but where is she?

269
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,313
Why there she is! The biggest one.

270
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,948
lsn't she wonderful!

271
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,598
That's the queen?

272
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,549
That's the queen?

273
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,358
That's the queen!

274
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,556
But she's not doing anything!

275
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,033
My kind of job!

276
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:35,517
Of course she is! She's doing a lot! lsn't she,
Ms. Frizzle?

277
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,151
Absolutely, Keesha! The queen is the only one
who lays the eggs!

278
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,670
The queen laid an egg. The end.

279
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,190
Not much of a movie, Keesha!

280
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,272
Sure it is! We start in close on the queen...

281
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,190
Then we pull back and...

282
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,399
No way, Keesha. This may be the queen, but
she's no star.

283
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,357
So what is it about? Keesha.

284
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,078
Nothing!

285
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,960
l give up!

286
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,036
Oh, great. lt's still raining. lt figures!

287
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,631
No, thank you. l'd rather walk! l deserve to get
wet!

288
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,518
Oh bad. Oh bad, bad, bad...

289
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:28,191
What made me think l could direct a movie?
Now l've wrecked the science fair for everyone.

290
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,150
Keesha?

291
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,715
Too bad l'm such a rotten director.

292
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,193
But you're not!

293
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,119
l am! l almost wiped out my whole class

294
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,875
and there's still no movie - no story - no star!

295
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,072
But what about the queen?

296
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,438
What kind of star just sits there and lays
eggs?

297
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:50,433
But if it weren't for her eggs, there wouldn't be
any ants.

298
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,399
So! lf it weren't for the ants that brought her
food, there wouldn't be a queen.

299
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,479
l see what you mean.

300
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,315
And if it weren't for the forager ants, there
wouldn't be food for anybody.

301
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,278
And if it weren't for the builder ants, there
wouldn't be a nest.

302
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,352
And if it weren't for the guard ants, the nest
would be attacked.

303
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,996
Yeah, there isn't only one star. More like they
all are.

304
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,631
Phoebe! That's it!

305
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,268
lt's really about ALL the ants!

306
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:22,194
All the ants...and how they work together!
Keesha! You're right!

307
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,750
Of course l'm right, because l'm the director,
come on!

308
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:32,038
Hey, where's everyone going? We've got a
movie to make about ants!

309
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,390
Without a star? Forget it.

310
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,313
l said ants, not ant!

311
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,836
There isn't one star in an anthill! All the ants
are stars!

312
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,708
Yeah! Every ant has a job to do to keep the
nest going!

313
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,675
...just like WE each have a job to do to make
this movie.

314
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,956
Forget the movie...MUD SLlDE

315
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,959
Everyone on the bus!

316
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,036
Hey! What about the ants!?!

317
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,310
As l always say...ACTlON!

318
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,273
Thanks, Ms. Frizzle!

319
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,630
CUT! We've got to save the ants!

320
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,755
How?

321
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,673
The magnifying glass! We'll block the
entrance!

322
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,149
Wanda, Ralphie, Carlos, Phoebe!
Grab that end!

323
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,153
DA, Arnold, Tim, Ms. Frizzle! And ...LlFT!

324
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,758
Keesha, it's great! A survival movie!

325
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:35,675
Yeah, and we'll call it, ''A River Almost Ran
Through lt''!!!

326
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:41,915
Finally, the nest was saved, the rain stopped,
and the sun came out!

327
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,558
The end!

328
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,599
That was amazing! How did you do it?

329
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,877
l didn't do a thing! lt was Keesha's idea.

330
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,555
Yes, but l couldn't have done it without
Phoebe!

331
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:01,070
And l couldn't have done it without...Without
Arnold!

332
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,589
And l couldn't have done it without Dorothy
Ann!

333
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,314
And l couldn't have done it without Carlos!

334
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,516
And l couldn't have done it without Wanda.

335
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,518
Her part was truly significANT! Get it?

336
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,398
CARLOS!!

337
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,436
And l couldn't have done it without Tim!

338
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,312
And l couldn't have done it without Ralphie!

339
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,829
And l couldn't have done it without Ms. Frizzle!

340
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,117
And l couldn't have done it without... the
school bus.

341
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:29,880
But none of us could have done it without the
inspiration of... ..the ANTS!

342
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:34,119
As l always say, it's easy if you've got talANT!!!

343
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,950
Ms. Frizzle!

344
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,994
ls it the magic school bus?

345
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:52,193
ls it the magic school bus?

346
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,390
ls it the magic school bus?

347
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,515
ls it the magic school bus?

348
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,119
ls it the magic school bus?

349
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,029
stay tune with us and be a smart kid

350
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,679
Okay Liz, l promise

351
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,553
l'll let everyone know how much work you did
on that movie.

352
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,997
Just let me take this call, okay?

353
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,634
Hi, you work on the Magic School Bus show,
right?

354
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,193
You bet. l am the producer.

355
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:30,870
One of them.

356
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,270
l know for a fact there are thousands of ants in
an ant colony

357
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,989
but in your show l only counted 137.

358
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,596
l guess you must be an accountANT. Get it...?

359
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,759
Oh boy, now l know who's responsible for all
the terrible puns.

360
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,869
Well actually, you're right, there are thousands
of ants in one colony

361
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,753
but we couldn't afford to hire that many extras.

362
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,838
And they're also thousands of different
SPEClES of ants.

363
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,150
You only showed one kind of ant.

364
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,755
Right again. There are about 10,000 different
kinds of ants,

365
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,956
more than all other social insects put together.

366
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:10,635
And you didn't say a thing about the fact that
all the ants we saw were female.

367
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:15,038
Yes, we feel quite repentANT about that.

368
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,193
Almost every ant in a colony is female.

369
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,393
The only thing the few males that are around
do is mate with the queen. Anything else?

370
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:26,195
Yes. Ants use pheromones for more than
telling friend from foe.

371
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,989
lt's how they communicate where food is, or if
the nest needs repairing -

372
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,355
they smell pheromones like we hear words!

373
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,079
You know, kid, l have to say, you're pretty darn
smart.

374
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,318
Actually, l'm brillyANT! Gotcha!

375
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,028
One more call, and that's it. Promise.

376
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,638
Hello, magic school bus?

377
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,878
This is the Oscar Awards committee returning
your call.

378
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,031
Yes, l just had a question about the rules.

379
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:59,188
ln the category of best camerawork, is it
possible to nominate a lizard?

380
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,593
THE END
