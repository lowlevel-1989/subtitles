I'm telling you, something's missing.

35
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:24,585
But Tim, when it comes to deserts, we've got
everything under the sun.

36
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,964
Sorry, DA, it just doesn't say "desert" yet.

37
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:39,256
Are you kidding? It screams "desert." We've
got sand. We've got gravel.

38
00:01:39,977 --> 00:01:44,354
We've got desert plants like cacti, creosote
bushes, ocotillo.

39
00:01:45,524 --> 00:01:48,276
We've got the desert's harsh conditions.

40
00:01:48,485 --> 00:01:50,608
Hot, blazing sun

41
00:01:50,696 --> 00:01:53,068
Dry, blinding dust storms.

42
00:01:55,117 --> 00:01:57,690
Tim's right. There is something missing!

43
00:02:05,294 --> 00:02:09,338
As I always say, Arnold, it never hurts to be
prepared.

44
00:02:09,464 --> 00:02:13,509
That's funny, Ms. Frizzle, that's exactly what l
was thinking.

45
00:02:13,594 --> 00:02:17,840
I know! I know! Desert animals! That's
what's missing!

46
00:02:18,056 --> 00:02:22,434
Ms. Frizzle, our diorama will never be
complete without desert animals!

47
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,724
Dynamic deduction, Phoebe!

48
00:02:29,318 --> 00:02:30,942
These should do for now.

49
00:02:31,028 --> 00:02:33,649
Now? It's later I'm worried about.

50
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,363
Thank you, Ms. Frizzle. Here you go, little
guy....

51
00:02:37,451 --> 00:02:43,904
According to my research, that's a kangaroo
rat. And that's a gila monster.

52
00:02:44,124 --> 00:02:46,330
Isn't it cute?!

53
00:02:46,418 --> 00:02:49,419
Only Phoebe would think a Gila monster is
cute.

54
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:58,884
And there's more...Tortoise...beetle...
scorpion...jackrabbit...roadrunner...

55
00:03:00,807 --> 00:03:03,595
Hey, Liz, what's up with you?

56
00:03:04,353 --> 00:03:08,302
And you know what this is? A baby coyote!

57
00:03:09,858 --> 00:03:13,986
Phoebe, are you sure all these animals live in
the desert?

58
00:03:14,404 --> 00:03:18,153
Think about it. The desert is really hot.

59
00:03:18,242 --> 00:03:22,738
The sun beats down all day long. Beat. Beat.
Beat.

60
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:28,458
And there's nowhere for the animals to go to
escape the heat...heat... heat!

61
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:29,494
But...

62
00:03:29,586 --> 00:03:33,666
Not only is it hot, but there's hardly any food in
the desert!

63
00:03:33,757 --> 00:03:38,585
So any animal that shows its face...gets
EATEN by a bigger one!

64
00:03:40,347 --> 00:03:41,094
STOP!

65
00:03:41,181 --> 00:03:43,257
And that's not all.

66
00:03:43,392 --> 00:03:44,222
It isn't?

67
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:48,936
The worst part? There's almost NO WATER
in the desert.

68
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,850
No water?

69
00:03:51,984 --> 00:03:56,277
Uh-uh. No shelter. No food. No water.

70
00:03:56,363 --> 00:04:01,819
In no time at all, all your cute little animals are
buzzard bait.

71
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:07,745
SCARClTY is the name of the game, Pheebs.
Scar-ci-ty.

72
00:04:07,874 --> 00:04:11,706
He's right, Phoebe. There's not much food,
water, or shelter in the desert.

73
00:04:11,795 --> 00:04:13,669
We've got to DO something!

74
00:04:13,755 --> 00:04:14,537
Yeah!

75
00:04:14,631 --> 00:04:16,540
What can we do? What can we do?

76
00:04:16,633 --> 00:04:18,092
What can WE do?

77
00:04:18,218 --> 00:04:22,382
Well, at my old school, we'd take a stand!
Form a committee!!

78
00:04:22,514 --> 00:04:23,973
Go on a field trip!?

79
00:04:25,434 --> 00:04:28,139
Arnold? Are you serious?

80
00:04:28,228 --> 00:04:31,811
He's right! SADS to the rescue!

81
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,221
SADS?

82
00:04:33,358 --> 00:04:35,730
Students Against Desert Scarcity!

83
00:04:35,903 --> 00:04:37,480
To the Desert!

84
00:04:38,363 --> 00:04:40,403
Ms. Frizzle? Yes Arnold?

85
00:04:40,741 --> 00:04:45,201
For once, I'm prepared.... Regulation Desert
gear...

86
00:04:45,287 --> 00:04:49,154
As outlined in Chapter 7 of my new Field Trip
Survival Guide....

87
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:52,287
Ms. Frizzle, do your worst!

88
00:04:52,377 --> 00:04:54,169
I'll do my best, Arnold!

89
00:04:54,296 --> 00:04:56,087
Well, are you guys coming,

90
00:04:56,173 --> 00:05:01,298
or do I have to save these desert animals all
by myself? To the bus!

91
00:05:01,386 --> 00:05:03,296
Follow that Phoebe!

92
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:14,939
Hey Arnold, so what d'you have in that
knapsack anyway.

93
00:05:15,067 --> 00:05:19,645
A little sunblock, snake bite kit, a few dozen
Malloblasters...

94
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,653
What?! No football!?

95
00:05:21,782 --> 00:05:24,533
Carlos, we are NOT going to the desert to
have FUN!

96
00:05:24,618 --> 00:05:30,324
We're not? The desert is full of surprises,
Phoebe.

97
00:05:30,415 --> 00:05:34,164
And this bus is so slow! Can't we go any
faster, Ms Frizzle?

98
00:05:34,253 --> 00:05:38,464
Every second we waste means those poor
little animals are out there suffering.

99
00:05:39,216 --> 00:05:44,922
That's one way of looking at it, Phoebe! Okay
bus! Do your stuff!

100
00:05:45,722 --> 00:05:47,715
All right!

101
00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:51,183
Way to go!!

102
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,148
Are we there yet?

103
00:06:06,243 --> 00:06:08,864
Chill, Phoebe. We only just took off.

104
00:06:09,204 --> 00:06:14,661
We're flying over mountains. Didn't you say
"Students Against DESERT Scarcity"?

105
00:06:15,043 --> 00:06:18,247
Yeah, and mountains have PLENTY of shelter,
food and water.

106
00:06:18,505 --> 00:06:20,877
Ms. Frizzle! We must be going the wrong
way!

107
00:06:20,966 --> 00:06:26,305
Wrong way? Why, Phoebe. If it weren't for
the mountains, there wouldn't be a desert.

108
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,431
What do mountains have to do with the
desert?

109
00:06:29,558 --> 00:06:32,096
Haven't you guys ever heard of a rain shadow?

110
00:06:32,227 --> 00:06:33,390
No...

111
00:06:34,938 --> 00:06:38,272
Some deserts are made by what's called the
rain shadow effect.

112
00:06:38,358 --> 00:06:41,312
When warm moist air rises over the
mountains...

113
00:06:41,403 --> 00:06:44,439
its water vapor condenses into rain or snow.

114
00:06:44,531 --> 00:06:46,690
The mountains catch all the moisture,

115
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:50,864
so the air reaching the other side is dry as a
desert.

116
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:53,535
Look out below!!

117
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:58,326
It's not fair! Why should the mountains get all
the water!

118
00:06:58,712 --> 00:07:02,662
If you keep asking questions, Phoebe. You'll
find an answer!

119
00:07:02,758 --> 00:07:06,376
Oh, and there's the perfect parking spot! Hold
on tight!

120
00:07:12,935 --> 00:07:17,513
Field Trip Tip Number 63, "ln the event of a
rapid loss of altitude

121
00:07:17,606 --> 00:07:21,224
you may want to put on a parachute." Liz, my
parachute.

122
00:07:22,444 --> 00:07:26,656
That's not a paraCHUTE, that's a
pair-a-SHOES!

123
00:07:41,213 --> 00:07:43,882
Look at this place!

124
00:07:44,258 --> 00:07:50,592
Whew! The Thermoprobe reads 1 07 degrees
Fahrenheit! That's HOT!

125
00:07:51,181 --> 00:07:53,719
How can anything live here?

126
00:07:55,477 --> 00:08:00,305
Is it just me? Or does this look like the "Final"
field trip.

127
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:03,815
Come along, class. We're here to experience
the desert!

128
00:08:04,236 --> 00:08:08,234
Take chances! Make mistakes! Get dusty!

129
00:08:08,323 --> 00:08:12,191
Field Trip Tip Number 87...Not a problem!

130
00:08:12,369 --> 00:08:16,497
Come on, you guys. Students Against Desert
Scarcity, remember?

131
00:08:16,582 --> 00:08:17,992
We've got work to do!

132
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:22,544
Desert Scarcity? What about Dessert
Scarcity? I'm hungry!

133
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:25,037
Hey, Arnold, where are those Malloblasters?

134
00:08:26,508 --> 00:08:28,916
I'm afraid they've melted.

135
00:08:29,011 --> 00:08:31,050
How can you even think about eating

136
00:08:31,138 --> 00:08:34,174
when all these poor little animals are suffering
from hunger?!

137
00:08:34,308 --> 00:08:37,344
The only poor little animals I see...are US!

138
00:08:38,478 --> 00:08:39,889
There's one!

139
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,849
Why that's a collared lizard!

140
00:08:45,986 --> 00:08:48,144
And that's a funny-looking bird!

141
00:08:48,447 --> 00:08:55,612
That, Keesha, is a fine example of a hungry
roadrunner chasing a delicious lizard to eat!

142
00:08:57,998 --> 00:09:00,370
Come on! We have to protect that lizard!

143
00:09:02,961 --> 00:09:07,041
At my old school, lizards never ran on their
hind legs!

144
00:09:07,841 --> 00:09:09,964
Quick, everyone, back in the bus!

145
00:09:10,052 --> 00:09:12,459
Phoebe. What are we doing??

146
00:09:12,554 --> 00:09:15,804
How would you like to be a lizard being
chased by a hungry roadrunner?

147
00:09:17,643 --> 00:09:20,762
A situation worth exploration, Phoebe!

148
00:09:23,982 --> 00:09:27,565
Wow, cool, we're shrinking

149
00:09:31,573 --> 00:09:36,780
As I always say...'when the going gets hungry,
the hungry get going.'

150
00:09:36,912 --> 00:09:39,617
Bad oh bad oh bad bad bad.

151
00:09:39,748 --> 00:09:42,749
And getting worse! It's gaining on us!

152
00:09:42,834 --> 00:09:46,001
I hate field trips where we get eaten!

153
00:09:58,267 --> 00:10:02,181
Any minute now, we're going to know what it
feels like to be EATEN!

154
00:10:03,021 --> 00:10:07,517
Field Trip Tip Number 107:. To avoid being
eaten become inedible.

155
00:10:07,651 --> 00:10:09,442
WHAT's THAT MEAN?!!

156
00:10:09,528 --> 00:10:13,146
Class? Do I hear a suggestion to avoid
digestion?

157
00:10:13,365 --> 00:10:15,523
According to my research, Arnold,

158
00:10:15,617 --> 00:10:18,654
it means we ought to become something that's
not very appetizing.

159
00:10:20,872 --> 00:10:25,618
On the button, DA! One inedible horned lizard
coming up!

160
00:10:31,884 --> 00:10:33,164
Phew! Close one!

161
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:42,383
Well, first-hand experience tells us
roadrunners don't like lizards with spikes!

162
00:10:42,561 --> 00:10:43,426
Would you?

163
00:10:43,562 --> 00:10:47,227
So, the little animals here have special ways
to avoid getting eaten

164
00:10:47,316 --> 00:10:49,604
Iike running fast or being prickly...

165
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,852
Phoebe, that's right!

166
00:10:52,112 --> 00:10:54,733
Which means they don't need your help,
Pheebs.

167
00:10:54,823 --> 00:10:58,691
Are you sure about that? Life is tough in the
desert.

168
00:10:58,785 --> 00:11:02,486
Don't we know it! It's too hot to chase after
animals!

169
00:11:02,748 --> 00:11:06,828
Or to be chased! Phew! I'm burning up!

170
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:11,794
Exactly! And somewhere out there is a poor
little animal which is burning up, too!

171
00:11:11,882 --> 00:11:14,717
Now come on, we've got to find it and help it!

172
00:11:14,927 --> 00:11:17,927
Stop the bus, please.

173
00:11:18,388 --> 00:11:19,468
Everybody out!

174
00:11:19,556 --> 00:11:21,383
Not again.

175
00:11:21,683 --> 00:11:23,842
Single file, class.

176
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,489
I'm hot!

177
00:11:37,074 --> 00:11:38,983
I'm tired!

178
00:11:39,368 --> 00:11:40,862
I'm hungry!

179
00:11:41,161 --> 00:11:42,952
I'm prepared.

180
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:51,541
Phoebe, we've been looking and looking...and
we haven't found anymore animals.

181
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:54,168
None, Phoebe. And I'm burning up!

182
00:11:54,299 --> 00:11:55,330
Me too!

183
00:11:55,467 --> 00:12:00,972
You're hot! What about that poor little
jackrabbit?!

184
00:12:01,098 --> 00:12:06,970
See? It's sitting there with the sun beating
down on its head! And it's wearing a fur coat.

185
00:12:07,062 --> 00:12:09,220
Field Trip Tip Number 1 58

186
00:12:09,314 --> 00:12:13,608
when the sun is beating down on your head,
put on a hat. Got that covered.

187
00:12:13,694 --> 00:12:14,808
Thanks, Arnold!

188
00:12:14,903 --> 00:12:16,184
Hey!!

189
00:12:16,363 --> 00:12:21,488
Here little jack rabbit. This will keep you from
getting too hot...a nice hat to shade your--

190
00:12:21,577 --> 00:12:22,775
Phoebe

191
00:12:23,036 --> 00:12:26,619
Arnold! Now how will that jackrabbit keep
cool?

192
00:12:26,707 --> 00:12:27,821
Well...

193
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:30,123
EAR-conditioning, Phoebe!

194
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:33,128
EAR-conditioning! Good one, Ms Frizzle!

195
00:12:33,213 --> 00:12:34,873
Thanks, Carlos

196
00:12:34,965 --> 00:12:37,966
Carlos! How can you joke at a time like this?

197
00:12:38,051 --> 00:12:41,716
According to my research, it's not a joke,
Phoebe!

198
00:12:42,931 --> 00:12:47,143
You know how a car radiator cools off hot
water from the engine...

199
00:12:47,227 --> 00:12:50,810
some desert animals have big ears which do
the same thing.

200
00:12:50,939 --> 00:12:55,400
When their warm blood moves through their
big ears, it gets cooled off in the same way!

201
00:12:55,485 --> 00:12:56,766
Stay cool.

202
00:13:00,782 --> 00:13:02,858
Come on, Pheebs, just admit it.

203
00:13:02,951 --> 00:13:06,154
The lizards don't need your help and neither
do the jackrabbits.

204
00:13:06,288 --> 00:13:11,792
Okay. So the jackrabbit has a way to keep
itself cool. But what about that!

205
00:13:12,711 --> 00:13:18,832
That is a desert tortoise! You don't usually see
them out in the heat like this.

206
00:13:18,967 --> 00:13:24,388
See? An animal in need! Come on! We've
got to help it!

207
00:13:24,514 --> 00:13:26,222
We do?

208
00:13:26,308 --> 00:13:28,301
Carlos, don't be so selfish

209
00:13:28,393 --> 00:13:31,597
How would you like to be a tortoise roasting in
the hot desert sun?

210
00:13:31,813 --> 00:13:33,806
I wish you hadn't said that...

211
00:13:34,441 --> 00:13:38,391
As I always say, there's more than one way to
beat the heat!

212
00:13:38,737 --> 00:13:40,315
Oh, no!

213
00:13:55,045 --> 00:13:59,339
So THlS is what it's like to be a desert
tortoise!

214
00:13:59,591 --> 00:14:01,002
Where are we?

215
00:14:01,093 --> 00:14:04,212
In a tortoise burrow. An underground shelter.

216
00:14:04,429 --> 00:14:06,885
It's A LOT cooler down here.

217
00:14:07,015 --> 00:14:10,219
Ah! Good observation, Keesha!

218
00:14:10,435 --> 00:14:15,678
Yes! Another animal that can keep cool
without your help, Pheebolino!

219
00:14:15,816 --> 00:14:18,567
But Carlos! I just thought of something!

220
00:14:18,652 --> 00:14:23,444
Maybe the reason we didn't see any animals is
because they all burned up before we got here!

221
00:14:23,865 --> 00:14:26,617
I knew it! We're too late!

222
00:14:28,287 --> 00:14:30,078
What's happening?

223
00:14:31,748 --> 00:14:35,331
Class, the bus is now on automatic turtle!

224
00:14:39,047 --> 00:14:42,333
We're being pushed by another desert
tortoise!

225
00:14:58,859 --> 00:15:00,816
Are we still in the desert?

226
00:15:00,944 --> 00:15:02,937
Wow, what happened?

227
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:06,814
The sun went down and the desert has totally
changed!

228
00:15:07,826 --> 00:15:14,161
Oh Carlos look! How sweet, eleven, twelve,
thirteen, fourteen...

229
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:18,502
Hey! We weren't too late! The reason we
didn't see any animals is

230
00:15:18,587 --> 00:15:21,623
because they were just waiting for the sun to
go down!

231
00:15:21,715 --> 00:15:27,421
50 degrees Fahrenheit! You don't have any
sweaters in that knapsack, do you Arnold?

232
00:15:28,889 --> 00:15:31,759
Once the sun goes down, the air cools off.

233
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:34,341
Field Trip Tip Number 257:.

234
00:15:34,436 --> 00:15:38,813
To beat the heat do like most desert
animals...come out only at night.

235
00:15:40,275 --> 00:15:45,103
There you have it, Phoebe. Another way
desert animals help themselves!

236
00:15:45,197 --> 00:15:48,862
It's okay, Phoebe. There's nothing wrong with
being wrong.

237
00:15:49,117 --> 00:15:53,495
As I always say, 'Make mistakes. Make
mistakes. Make mistakes.'

238
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,617
It's the best way to learn something.

239
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:02,207
But, let's face it - Students Against Desert
Scarcity is a bust.

240
00:16:02,464 --> 00:16:06,296
Okay, Carlos. Okay. You don't have to rub it
in

241
00:16:06,426 --> 00:16:08,466
I might have made a mistake about that lizard.

242
00:16:08,554 --> 00:16:11,223
And I might have made a mistake about the
jack rabbit.

243
00:16:11,306 --> 00:16:14,722
And I even might have made a mistake about
the tortoise.

244
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:16,802
But there's one thing I know I'm not wrong
about...

245
00:16:16,937 --> 00:16:19,558
How much you wish you'd stayed home today?

246
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:22,560
No. How much everything here on the desert
needs water!!

247
00:16:22,651 --> 00:16:24,110
You're telling me!

248
00:16:26,405 --> 00:16:27,318
Thanks, Ralphie.

249
00:16:27,406 --> 00:16:28,401
Phoebe!

250
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:32,025
Well, if no one's going to help me give water
to all these poor little animals..

251
00:16:32,119 --> 00:16:33,946
I'll just do it MYSELF!

252
00:16:34,037 --> 00:16:36,077
Phoebe! Where are you going?

253
00:16:36,206 --> 00:16:39,077
I said I was going to give these poor animals
water, and I'm going to...

254
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:43,497
Phoebe, I know this may sound crazy, but hear
me out.

255
00:16:43,589 --> 00:16:45,131
Okay, Carlos - I'm listening.

256
00:16:45,215 --> 00:16:48,549
These animals didn't need your protection
from being eaten

257
00:16:48,635 --> 00:16:50,711
or from burning up in the sun, right?

258
00:16:50,804 --> 00:16:51,670
Right...

259
00:16:51,805 --> 00:16:53,596
They can cope. Right?

260
00:16:53,682 --> 00:16:54,678
Right...

261
00:16:54,933 --> 00:16:58,385
Well, maybe they don't need your water,
either.

262
00:16:58,478 --> 00:17:01,396
Carlos, HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT??

263
00:17:01,481 --> 00:17:03,889
You KNOW there's no water in the desert.

264
00:17:03,984 --> 00:17:07,020
You said so yourself. Rain
shadow...remember?

265
00:17:07,321 --> 00:17:10,654
But look at them. They couldn't live without
water.

266
00:17:10,741 --> 00:17:14,525
And they are definitely alive. They must get it
somehow.

267
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:18,664
Okay, then, if you're so smart, tell me HOW!

268
00:17:18,874 --> 00:17:24,461
Come on, Carlos, take chances, get messy,
make MlSTAKES.

269
00:17:24,546 --> 00:17:27,464
I...I don't know.

270
00:17:27,591 --> 00:17:32,253
Exactly. Maybe people like me come out here
and give the animals water.

271
00:17:32,888 --> 00:17:35,924
Maybe people like me keep these animals
alive.

272
00:17:37,184 --> 00:17:39,722
Hey, at least save the water for the animals...

273
00:17:39,853 --> 00:17:41,431
What are you talking about?

274
00:17:41,563 --> 00:17:43,223
Didn't you just splash me?

275
00:17:44,274 --> 00:17:46,397
Is that... rain??

276
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:54,196
Everyone back on the bus!

277
00:17:54,326 --> 00:17:55,524
Rain?

278
00:17:55,619 --> 00:17:56,782
In the desert?

279
00:17:56,912 --> 00:17:59,913
It doesn't rain here very often class, but...

280
00:18:03,085 --> 00:18:08,375
as I always say, not very often is a long way
from never!

281
00:18:08,632 --> 00:18:12,083
And the desert is a long way from needing my
water...

282
00:18:12,344 --> 00:18:16,093
And we're a long way from the bus. Come on,
Phoebe!

283
00:18:16,181 --> 00:18:21,804
Doesn't it feel GREAT? NOW we're talking
WATER.

284
00:18:22,312 --> 00:18:32,858
It's amazing. We went from absolutely no
water to....FLOOOD!

285
00:18:51,466 --> 00:18:55,713
Good morning, class! Everything's right as
rain!

286
00:18:56,346 --> 00:18:58,006
Where are we?

287
00:18:58,098 --> 00:18:59,676
What happened to the desert?

288
00:19:01,977 --> 00:19:04,468
Is this a dream?

289
00:19:04,771 --> 00:19:09,729
No, Phoebe, it's the desert after a rainstorm.

290
00:19:09,818 --> 00:19:13,602
Everything's changed. There's so much
activity.

291
00:19:13,697 --> 00:19:18,655
What happened to all the scarcity? Look at all
these plants and animals.

292
00:19:19,494 --> 00:19:23,160
Desert life never ceases to amaze me!

293
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:27,454
Do you see what I see? Flower power!

294
00:19:27,628 --> 00:19:30,913
It's as if they were waiting for enough water to
bloom.

295
00:19:31,673 --> 00:19:34,247
There are shrimp in this puddle!

296
00:19:34,384 --> 00:19:36,673
Shrimp? In the desert??

297
00:19:37,721 --> 00:19:40,592
Ah huh and pigs too, look!

298
00:19:40,849 --> 00:19:45,558
Actually that's a peccary, a desert relative of
pigs.

299
00:19:45,646 --> 00:19:47,722
And this cactus is full of water!

300
00:19:48,023 --> 00:19:54,192
According to my observations, this piece of
cactus is juicy on the inside

301
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:56,651
and waxy on the outside.

302
00:19:56,907 --> 00:20:00,490
Hey...maybe that waxy stuff keeps the water in.

303
00:20:00,702 --> 00:20:05,115
As I always say, when it pours, the desert
stores.

304
00:20:05,374 --> 00:20:07,366
You know, Phoebe. You were right.

305
00:20:07,459 --> 00:20:09,084
The desert does need water.

306
00:20:09,169 --> 00:20:12,752
And the animals need protection from being
eaten and from the heat.

307
00:20:13,006 --> 00:20:15,544
Yeah but Carlos, you were right too.

308
00:20:15,676 --> 00:20:20,172
They don't need us to help them. They're
already equipped to live here.

309
00:20:20,305 --> 00:20:22,298
That's right, Phoebe.

310
00:20:22,391 --> 00:20:27,218
Everything that lives here has adaptations to
help cope with life in the desert.

311
00:20:27,688 --> 00:20:30,060
Come along, class! Back to the bus.

312
00:20:30,148 --> 00:20:34,775
You mean soaking up water as quickly as
possible is an adaptation?

313
00:20:35,153 --> 00:20:37,561
Absolutely correct!

314
00:20:37,656 --> 00:20:40,028
And having spikes is an adaptation...

315
00:20:40,158 --> 00:20:42,151
...that helps keep you off the menu.

316
00:20:42,703 --> 00:20:44,612
And burrowing under the sand

317
00:20:44,705 --> 00:20:48,619
and having big ears is an adaptation for
beating the heat.

318
00:20:49,626 --> 00:20:53,458
Yes! All the things that live here have
adaptations for survival.

319
00:20:53,547 --> 00:20:56,038
It makes so much sense, doesn't it?

320
00:20:58,635 --> 00:21:03,796
Field Trip Tip Number 999. For those without
desert adaptations

321
00:21:03,891 --> 00:21:06,845
always travel with a teacher with frizzy
red-hair.

322
00:21:22,868 --> 00:21:26,912
Well, I have to say, except for the part where
we almost got eaten...

323
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,075
...and the part where we almost burned up in
the sun...

324
00:21:30,167 --> 00:21:32,574
and the part where we almost drowned in a
flood...

325
00:21:32,669 --> 00:21:35,919
...my field trip manual was REALLY helpful.

326
00:21:38,884 --> 00:21:41,553
So glad you enjoyed it, Arnold.

327
00:21:42,221 --> 00:21:44,213
Well, now that I know that all these plants

328
00:21:44,306 --> 00:21:47,342
and animals have adaptations to help them
cope with living in the desert,

329
00:21:47,476 --> 00:21:49,848
that gives me some time to save something
else.

330
00:21:50,312 --> 00:21:52,684
Phoebe, I don't think this is a...

331
00:21:52,773 --> 00:21:55,311
I tell you, we've got to DO something!

332
00:21:55,484 --> 00:21:57,891
Phoebe! We just DlD something!

333
00:21:57,986 --> 00:22:00,109
A whole bunch of somethings!

334
00:22:00,322 --> 00:22:05,862
But this time it really is an animal in need.
We'll call ourselves SASH!

335
00:22:05,953 --> 00:22:07,328
SASH?

336
00:22:07,412 --> 00:22:10,497
Students Assisting Sleepy Heads!

337
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:13,157
CARLOS!!

338
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:19,498
He obviously has no adaptations to cope with
desert field trips!

339
00:22:19,716 --> 00:22:24,544
According to my research, Phoebe,
hibernation lS an adaptation!

340
00:22:28,141 --> 00:22:34,096
As I always say, if you can't take the heat, get
out of the desert!

341
00:22:42,322 --> 00:22:43,603
Is it the magic school bus?

342
00:22:43,699 --> 00:22:48,159
Is it the magic school bus?

343
00:22:48,245 --> 00:22:49,407
Is it the magic school bus?

344
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,528
Is it the magic school bus?

345
00:22:50,664 --> 00:22:52,158
Is it the magic school bus?

346
00:22:52,332 --> 00:22:56,377
stay tune with us and be a smart kid

347
00:23:02,968 --> 00:23:06,586
Are you sure the Producer wanted this fake
cactus, Liz?

348
00:23:11,768 --> 00:23:13,013
I better go...

349
00:23:13,312 --> 00:23:19,267
Me? At my old school, kids NEVER answered
the phone. Hello...?

350
00:23:19,484 --> 00:23:21,442
Is this the Magic School Bus?

351
00:23:21,528 --> 00:23:22,442
Yes, but...

352
00:23:22,529 --> 00:23:24,688
Good, because you see I'm starting up a new
group...

353
00:23:24,781 --> 00:23:27,948
Save Our Kangaroo Rats...and I want Phoebe
to be president.

354
00:23:28,201 --> 00:23:31,238
You do? I mean that's nice of you to say

355
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:33,999
but kangaroo rats don't need to be saved.

356
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:38,539
You mean, they have adaptations which make
it possible for them to live in the desert, too?

357
00:23:38,837 --> 00:23:43,049
Right. For instance, they may never take a
drink in their entire lives.

358
00:23:43,175 --> 00:23:46,793
They can get all the water they need from the
seeds and plants they eat.

359
00:23:47,346 --> 00:23:50,880
Well, do they have an adaptation to help them
cope with the short nights?

360
00:23:50,974 --> 00:23:52,599
Short nights?

361
00:23:52,684 --> 00:23:56,764
Yeah, watching that show you'd think that night
time lasted about five seconds.

362
00:23:57,105 --> 00:24:00,854
Oh, well, we were a little short on time...

363
00:24:00,984 --> 00:24:01,731
Ah-ha!

364
00:24:02,027 --> 00:24:06,356
But just a little! We wanted to show how
desert animals come out at night.

365
00:24:06,615 --> 00:24:08,406
It's an adaptation, you know!

366
00:24:08,659 --> 00:24:11,232
Okay, speaking of "adaptations,"

367
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:14,786
I don't know of ANY plant that grows from a
seed the instant it rains.

368
00:24:14,873 --> 00:24:18,289
Look, when you have a lot of information to
cover in a half hour,

369
00:24:18,377 --> 00:24:21,662
you don't have time to wait for seeds to grow
into plants!

370
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,715
But they do grow very quickly in the desert.

371
00:24:24,925 --> 00:24:28,210
Did you want to see the desert in full bloom
after the rain or not?

372
00:24:28,303 --> 00:24:32,218
Of course I did...And did you know that cactus
needles are really leaves?

373
00:24:32,349 --> 00:24:34,176
Is that an adaptation?

374
00:24:34,351 --> 00:24:37,637
Yes! Unlike leaves, needles don't lose any
water!

375
00:24:38,564 --> 00:24:41,518
And you know what else? Not all deserts are
hot..

376
00:24:43,485 --> 00:24:47,435
Even places that are very cold are called
deserts if they don't get enough rain.

377
00:24:47,781 --> 00:24:50,652
Fascinating! Well, thanks for calling.

378
00:24:50,742 --> 00:24:54,870
Wait! One more question! Do you actually
know Phoebe?

379
00:24:54,997 --> 00:24:56,277
Yes. In fact--

380
00:24:56,373 --> 00:25:02,376
Could you do me a favor? Just tell her I think
she's the greatest. Goodbye!

381
00:25:02,588 --> 00:25:05,209
Maybe I should answer the phone more
often...

382
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:08,213
THE END
