0
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,874
Let's see...the plangdabber's connected to the
dinplonker...

1
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,956
the blagblatter's connected to the katiebator...

2
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,398
This always happens.

3
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,796
The shrinker-scope breaks the second the
warranty runs out...

4
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,714
Oh bus!

5
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,750
What am l going to do with you?

6
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,997
Okay. Ready for a rehearsal?

7
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,633
She's gonna love it!!

8
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,233
A one and a two...

9
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,277
SURPRlSE!

10
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,793
Yes!

11
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,033
Something's missing...l know it...

12
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,390
My chemistry experiment. lt's almost done.

13
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,114
Your homework?? At a time like this??

14
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,472
l'm mixing three things together - water, sand
and cement...

15
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,438
to get something new...concrete!!

16
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,159
That's what missing...

17
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,518
Cake!!!!

18
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,989
l can't believe it!! We forgot the cake!!

19
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,028
How can we throw a birthday party for Ms.
Frizzle, without a cake!!

20
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,473
What a disaster

21
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,909
Oh well...

22
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,799
Good morning, class.

23
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,635
Good morning, Ms. Frizzle.

24
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,837
Oh. l see you've heard the news.

25
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:33,759
l'm disappointed too. The bus is acting
up...so...today's field trip is cancelled.

26
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,276
Oh no!! Not the chemistry trip!!

27
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,279
That's okay, Ms. Frizzle. We'll get over it.

28
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,879
lt was all arranged.

29
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,076
We were going to the bakery...

30
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,469
Bakery...

31
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,353
A bakery?? What's that got to do with
chemistry??

32
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,598
Baking is chemistry, Ralphie. lt's like my
cement experiment--

33
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,429
mixing parts together to make something new,
only tastier...

34
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,439
A bakery is really just a small chemical plant.

35
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,672
Except it's a plant where they make...cakes!!!

36
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,919
Gee, Ms. Frizzle, you know

37
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,510
we've all been looking forward to this
chemistry field trip for months...

38
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,271
We have??

39
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,109
Oh yeah. We have.

40
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,356
And, well...l don't think any of us

41
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:20,117
would think our education was complete
without a trip to a bak---...ah, chemical plant...

42
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,032
Why...Carlos...

43
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,390
Does everyone feel this way?

44
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,316
Well, l'm not one to stand in the way of taking
chances,

45
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,358
making mistakes, and getting messy!!

46
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,992
Bus problems or no bus problems, To the
bakery!!

47
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,548
Yessss!!!

48
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,868
Oh, no.

49
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,390
Now, bus, that wasn't so difficult, was it?

50
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,552
Maybe it was...

51
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,352
Great. How're we supposed to get a cake
when we're this size???

52
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,710
And how're we supposed to even get in
there??

53
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,517
Can't let a tiny bit shrinkage spoil our fun, now
can we Liz?

54
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,228
Well, l guess that answers my question...

55
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,876
Bus. Bus.

56
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,238
Yes, honey. We're going to take the bus
home.

57
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,194
All gone.

58
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,750
Maybe it's a problem with the iotascope. Or
perhaps the enormomometer...

59
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,158
Liz. Not one of these cakes is chocolate! And
that's her favorite.

60
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,596
Besides...we're too small to buy one anyway.

61
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,994
What'll we do?

62
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,159
Well...we could make one...

63
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,469
Are you serious??

64
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,675
Get real!

65
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:22,436
All right!! A full-scale chemistry experiment!!

66
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,273
But how will we do it without Ms. Frizzle
seeing?

67
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,356
We'll just have to get her out of the bakery...

68
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,000
But a teacher never abandons her bus.

69
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,795
Ms Frizzle?...You know how the
shrinker-scope is acting up?

70
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:40,671
Could be the shrinker-scope. Might also be the
mesmerglobber. But yes, Carlos?

71
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,476
Well, there's this a great auto parts store right
next door, see, and...

72
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,996
Carlos, what a good idea!

73
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,839
lt worked...!

74
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,799
Liz, you're in charge!

75
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,033
You're joking!?

76
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,596
See you laterrrrrrrrrrrrr...

77
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,549
Bye, bye.

78
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,792
C'mon, liz, let's go.

79
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,996
Blistering bagels!! Moths?? ln my kitchen??!!

80
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,349
Quick! Set 'er down over there, Liz!!

81
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,714
Where did it go???

82
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:56,793
l'll be back, l shall returrnnn...

83
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,751
Phew! That was close!

84
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,308
Come on, we have work to do!

85
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:07,434
We are about to combine a few parts into a
magnificent new whole:

86
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,354
the finest birthday cake ever!!...

87
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,115
Okay! The first thing we have to do is gather
and measure the ingredients...

88
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:18,154
Ralphie: get two eggs! Tim and Wanda: a cup
of sugar and lots of flour!

89
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,954
Liz: a teaspoon each of salt and cream of
tartar!

90
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,231
Keesha: milk and lots of it!

91
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,356
Phoebe: butter! Arnold: baking soda.

92
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,277
And Dorothy Ann, you guard the door

93
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,271
and make sure Ms. Frizzle doesn't come back
too soon!!

94
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,279
Now what about me? Guess l'm stuck getting
the chocolate!

95
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,799
EGGS-actly the ingredient l was looking for.

96
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,189
And-a one. A-two. Aaaaaand...THREE!

97
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:06,397
l am the King of Soda!!

98
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,113
Arnold!! Youyouyouyou....

99
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,508
You what, D.A...?

100
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:20,553
You amazing chemist!!! You look at that stuff
fizz!!

101
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,393
The vinegar spilled into the baking soda.

102
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,318
l wonder what would happen if l used this...

103
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,029
Perfect

104
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:43,356
Mmmm, definitely sugar - my favorite
ingredient!

105
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,114
This won't be easy.

106
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,994
Thanks, Ralphie!

107
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,875
Oh, Phoebe, at your old school you were never
such a butterfingers!

108
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,269
Gotcha.

109
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,154
Now, we've got all the ingredients to make a
cake except the eggs. Where's Ralphie?

110
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,073
TOUCHDOWN!

111
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,358
Yes!!

112
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:26,955
Amazing!! Now what happens if l mix a LOT of
vinegar with a little bit of baking soda?

113
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,316
You don't know 'til you try, Dorothy Ann!!

114
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,750
Ms. Frizzle...you're, uh...back!!

115
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:38,716
Unfortunately, the mechanic over there doesn't
know a dwangflommer from a plonthoister.

116
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,912
So l'd thought l'd pop back and see how
everyone's doing...

117
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:49,636
say, Ms. Frizzle. How'd you like to help me
with a little experiment...?

118
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,714
Excellent idea.

119
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,720
A little bit more... keep going...

120
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,671
Man!! This is tough when you're half the size
of a hot dog!!

121
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,074
Could be worse, Arnold...

122
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,872
l don't see how...

123
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,749
Now l do...

124
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,710
Oh noooooooooo, we shrunk...

125
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,712
Man-o-man-o-man-o-man...

126
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,791
What to do, what to do...

127
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,469
Look at us!

128
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,759
l guess this is what happens when you travel
with faulty equipment.

129
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,714
Wait!! l've got an idea!! Be right back!!

130
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,677
Swell. Now what do we do?

131
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,113
Hey! Look at this!

132
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,991
Wow! Where'd you find those great building
blocks?

133
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,038
These aren't building blocks..Catch!

134
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,717
Hey, this is salt!

135
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,153
Hey, everybody! l found a DlAMOND! Check
out the glimmering surface...

136
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,198
Here's another diamond!

137
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,635
And another one!

138
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,517
We're going to be RlCH!

139
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:04,151
Not rich--sweet! This is SUGAR!

140
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,475
So this is what sugar looks like close up.

141
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,591
See how the sides make a pattern.

142
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,468
Things that looked alike when we were
big..look different now that we're small!

143
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,236
Let's go you guys! We gotta finish it before the
baker catches us!

144
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,198
Some salt.

145
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,631
Here comes some sugar.

146
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,476
Shimmerin' shortbreads!

147
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,758
Now, some flour.

148
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,156
We can't use this flour--it's got something in it!

149
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,631
No it doesn't. This is what flour looks like
close up.

150
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,399
Even flour is made up of different parts.

151
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:12,797
l...l couldn't have seen what l thought l
saw...Holy hotdog bun!!

152
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,752
Now that's what l call flour power!

153
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,712
And now for the best ingredient of them all!

154
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,837
Chocolate! Yummy!

155
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,235
Hey!! Mixing in the chocolate makes it a new
colour!

156
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,639
Sure it does, Keesha.

157
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,878
but check out how you can still see which bits
are chocolate and which ones aren't!!

158
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,592
Now we need the wet stuff! Hang on,
everyone!

159
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,356
At least milk still looks like milk.

160
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,829
Sufferin' sweetrolls!! lt must be those blasted
moths!!

161
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,316
Operator?? Get me Smug Bug Pest Control!!
And hurry!!

162
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,950
And now for a real eggs-periment! Eggs away!

163
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,398
Yes!! Pouring the milk, that's correct!!

164
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,790
And now they're...carrying eggs.

165
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,796
Whaddyou mean you've never seen that
behaviour in moths before??

166
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,196
Oh yeah? Well, same to you!!

167
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:30,391
Salt, sugar, flour, cream of tartar, milk, butter,
eggs, chocolate...aaaaaand....

168
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,273
baking soda! Hit it, Liz!

169
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,675
So...Ms. Frizzle...

170
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,598
is this amazing chemistry or what???

171
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,919
You bet, D.A...

172
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,032
But maybe l should check on the rest of the
class now...

173
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,635
Oh no!! The Friz is back!!

174
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,797
Come on, come on, come on, DA!! Think of
something!!

175
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,679
Come on, come on, come on, DA. Think!

176
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,796
Hey!! Ms. Frizzle! What would happen

177
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:04,396
if l put a whole bunch of baking soda into a
bottle with the vinegar??

178
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,916
There's only one way to find out!!

179
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,468
What a mess!

180
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,838
lt's a chemical reaction

181
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,639
The balloon!

182
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,516
and a real beauty, too!

183
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,474
No kidding!!

184
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,837
Baking soda and vinegar mixed together made
something new.

185
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,032
A gas that pushes out the sides of the balloon!

186
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,913
Just like filling a tire with air!!

187
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,919
Dorothy Ann! That reminds me!!

188
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,635
The bus needs new tires!! l wonder how much
that'll be?

189
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,715
l better go check, thanks for reminding me!!

190
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,790
Yesss!! Way to go DA!!

191
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,710
No, l am not crazy.

192
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:07,755
Perhaps my establishment just happens to
attract a higher breed of moth, that's all!!

193
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,477
lf you want anything done right, you have to do
it yourself...

194
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,110
Now, the next step is to mix all the ingredients
together.

195
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,272
Whew! That's gonna take some monster
beaters!

196
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,119
Good idea, Ralphie!

197
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,276
EGG BEATERS!

198
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,992
Everything's getting mixed together.

199
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,390
Yeah, and one more ingredient's getting
added.

200
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,035
What's that?

201
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,834
Air!! The beaters are forcing AlR into the mix.

202
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,520
All the parts are combining into one new thing.

203
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,636
lt's called cake batter!

204
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,870
But if Ms. Frizzle asks, it's --

205
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,831
CHEMlSTRY!!

206
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,276
Cooks and chemists are a lot alike. Both
measure out ingredients...

207
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,039
and mix them together..to make something
new!

208
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,715
The only difference is... l get to taste mine!

209
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,949
Hear that???

210
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,279
He's gonna see us??

211
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,159
Yummy. But when did l make this??

212
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,073
Maybe...that moth...

213
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,478
l am going crazy...

214
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,193
What's happening?

215
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,960
Why is it suddenly getting so hot?

216
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,720
Maybe it's because the floor is on fire.

217
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:54,476
l am pleased to announce the addition of the
last ingredient - HEAT!

218
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,796
Carlos! Do you mean to say...

219
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,673
Yes! WE'RE lN THE OVEN! And that
means...

220
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,189
...WE'RE GETTlNG BAKED!!

221
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,271
Help!!!

222
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,030
Wait a second here.

223
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:24,593
lf my facts are straight--we're stuck in a cake
baking in an intensely hot oven!!!

224
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:30,750
At my old school, we never got baked...except
that time the air conditioning went...

225
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,716
We're toast...!!

226
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,156
Well, technically no, but you've got the right
idea...

227
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:41,275
is it just me...or is that the Tin Man from ''The
Wizard of Oz''??

228
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,716
Maybe we should ask Toto, here...

229
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,677
Phew! Warm one today.

230
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,552
MS. FRlZZLE?

231
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,436
Feels like somebody forgot to put up the
heat-shield.

232
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,839
Much better!

233
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,313
Oh, good.

234
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,469
Thanks, Ms. Frizzle.

235
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,479
As l always say, if you can't stand the heat --
get out of the oven.

236
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,476
Yeah, but how?

237
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,596
Hey, look! The batter's moving!

238
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,589
According to my research, the baking soda is
making bubbles!!

239
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,716
Whoa! Now what?

240
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,470
The batter's not the only thing getting pushed
around...!

241
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,029
What's that noise?

242
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,513
lt's steam!

243
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:38,276
Excellent observations! lt's so hot that the
water in the batter is vaporizing,

244
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,715
making more and bigger bubbles.

245
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,476
The batter is starting to look kind of solid.

246
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,750
The cake, it's done!

247
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:57,077
Ah, the sweet smell of parts combining into a
new and magnificent whole!

248
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,479
Now...l wonder if the baker is making this cake
with a special customer in mind...

249
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,917
Oh no. We're going to have our cake and be
EATEN too!

250
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,472
No digressions for indigestion, Arnold. We
just...

251
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,028
Oh well, as l always say, the more mixup
things are, the better the solution.

252
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,309
We're doomed!

253
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,353
Wait!! l've got it! ls there any baking soda left?

254
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,156
Plenty...

255
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,790
Vinegar?

256
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,792
Hmmm. Red, tarragon, or regular white??

257
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,075
Uhhh...regular white is fine...

258
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,829
What are you doing DA?

259
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,518
Yeah. we gotta get outta here!

260
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,388
Well, Baking soda plus vinegar equals...

261
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,114
...the gas pressure we need to push us out of
here!

262
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,272
Dorothy Ann, you are one brilliant chemist!

263
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,391
Gee, thanks.

264
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,951
Come on you guys, hurry.

265
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,438
Yesss

266
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,755
Hooray!

267
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,915
We made it!

268
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,559
We're out!

269
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,393
And stay out!!!

270
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:50,511
Finally!! All fixed. Who'd've guessed?? lt was
the hinkleblammenjammenflappe--

271
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,870
Surprise!!!!

272
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:59,629
Why...class...this is wonderful...l don't know
what to say...

273
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:04,038
That's not all, Ms. Frizzle...we still have the big
finale!!

274
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:07,237
A big finale?? What could that be??

275
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,435
Ready, Arnold...?

276
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,675
You bet...

277
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,679
Class!! Where did you ever get such a lovely
cake...??

278
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,633
You wouldn't believe us if we told you...

279
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:23,631
The baker just gave it to us...said it was
ruined...something about a moth...

280
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,030
But, frankly, we didn't believe him...

281
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,877
As l always say: chemistry, it's a piece o'
cake!!

282
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,279
ls it the magic school bus?

283
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,349
ls it the magic school bus?

284
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,432
ls it the magic school bus?

285
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,635
ls it the magic school bus?

286
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,749
ls it the magic school bus?

287
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,235
ls it the magic school bus?

288
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:00,195
stay tune with us and be a smart kid

289
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:17,195
Finally!! All my baking!! Done for the day!!

290
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:25,118
Wow. ls this the bakery where they filmed that
'Magic Schoolbus' show?

291
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,755
Yes, yes of course!! l was brilliant in it!!

292
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,270
A remarkable tenor, that's whatthe Frizzle
Opera Review said...

293
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,475
Those look good.

294
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,718
l bet you a donut l can tell you some crucial
information missing from the show...

295
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:42,669
What?? lmpossible!! You insult me!! You're
on...

296
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,988
lt was--

297
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:49,871
WAlT!! Was it that Dorothy Ann is a little
young to be doing those experiments??

298
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,428
Not really. Ms. Frizzle was there,

299
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,476
and everyone knows you need a grown-up
around

300
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:58,394
when you're doing chemistry experiments. And
she was wearing goggles.

301
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,994
Ha!! Then l'll bet you two donuts...

302
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,274
Sure!! lt was--

303
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,598
--WAlT!! Was it that some people think
chemicals are bad for them?

304
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:10,150
No - some chemicals are good. lt depends on
what you use them for.

305
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,674
Okay...three donuts, then...

306
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,869
Okay!! lt was--

307
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:18,112
WAlT!! Was it though we said things are
made out of parts

308
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,270
we never said what the parts are made of???

309
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,551
No. l already knew they're made of smaller
parts called atoms.

310
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:27,792
And atoms are made of even smaller parts.
And so on and so on. lt was--

311
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,871
WAlT!!

312
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,831
Maybe you think things like salt

313
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:35,435
and sugar don't really look like building blocks
and diamonds.

314
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:39,439
They do under a microscope... l love looking
through microscopes.
