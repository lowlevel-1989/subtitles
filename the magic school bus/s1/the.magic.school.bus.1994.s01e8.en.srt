1
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,831
Are you ready, Carlos?

1
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,148
Almost!

2
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,152
Carlos? Was it...supposed to sound like that?

3
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,798
NO WAY!! l don't get it! lt looks incredible!
Stupendous! But it sounds...

4
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,517
''Ploopy''?

5
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,878
Exactly! What did l do wrong?

6
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,912
Wow! She's amazing!

7
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,390
That's one way to look at it. . .

8
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,800
Good morning, class!

9
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,191
Good morning, Ms Frizzle.

10
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,750
Dorothy Ann, l take it that was your new piece

11
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,876
Concerto for lnvented lnstrument?

12
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,311
Well, it was the concerto part, all right, but...

13
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,153
but the lnvented lnstrument was ploopy!

14
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,070
And there's almost no time to fix it before the
concert at the Sound Museum tomorrow.

15
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,357
Yeah, and we've got our rehearsal there this
afternoon.

16
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,312
So, what's the problem, Carlos?

17
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,233
Well, l have a great idea for a sound --

18
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:49,996
Ooh, and l see you're building an impressive
instrument to make it! Marvelous!

19
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,318
That's the problem. l can hear the sound in
my head, but...

20
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,669
Ploopy

21
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,472
What am l going to do?

22
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,430
Well, if you keep asking questions, Carlos,
you'll keep getting answers.

23
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,519
But there's no time for questions, Ms. Frizzle.

24
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,150
We're going to be late for the rehearsal at the
sound museum.

25
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,399
And, as we all know, those who are great are
never late!

26
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,080
Come along, class! To the bus!

27
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,478
We're going? Now? But... but... Ms. Frizzle.

28
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:29,353
But what if the sound of Carlos's instrument
stays...just like that?

29
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,715
Oh, our concerto will be ruined.

30
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,635
All the other schools will laugh at us and it'll
be the end of the world as we know it.

31
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,675
Other than that...nothing.

32
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,109
What else can l put on this thing to get it to
make a terrific sound?

33
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,713
Let's see...Okay, there!

34
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,550
lf only l had more TlME!

35
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,192
More time...Okay, bus, do your stuff!

36
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,748
An award winning performance bus!

37
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,398
Oh no!!

38
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,997
And now for the grand finale!

39
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,958
What happened?!

40
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,788
Not to worry, class. l'll just be a moment.

41
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:32,479
Oh dear...

42
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:42,190
Just as l thought. Overheated. l believe we'll
be here for a while.

43
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,674
We're going to miss the dress rehearsal?

44
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,354
Now rest up. You'll be fine.

45
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,757
All right! Time to work on my sound.

46
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,997
Ms. Frizzle, isn't there something we can do?

47
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,275
Well, now that you mention it...

48
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:10,709
lt's really quiet, isn't it? There's hardly a
sound.

49
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,356
Just us. Desperate. Alone... Vulnerable...

50
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,509
What was that?!

51
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,029
lt was me. How was that, Dorothy Ann?

52
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:26,075
l want my instrument to have the power of a
thunderstorm, so l put an umbrella on it.

53
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,078
That sounded more like drizzle, Carlos!

54
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,154
How about this? l want it to have the roar of a
lion, so l gave it a mane.

55
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,951
lt's a kitten, Carlos!

56
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,435
Forget it, Carlos!

57
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,911
lt looks better and better, but it sounds worse
and worse!

58
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,232
What was that?!

59
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,475
All right!

60
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,511
That's a great sound!

61
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,117
But it wasn't me. lt came from...there.

62
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,354
lsn't it mellifluous?!

63
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,238
That's not exactly the word l'd use for it...

64
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:25,678
Come on, Arnold! lt's just a house! You're not
scared of a house, are you?

65
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,676
Me, too...

66
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,639
What's wrong with you, class? Where's your
spirit of adventure?

67
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,473
Take chances! Make mistakes!

68
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,836
Get scared out of our wits...

69
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,354
Oh, don't be so chicken, Ralphie!

70
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:45,198
There must be a phone in there and we can
call a tow truck! Come on!

71
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,633
What a weird place!

72
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,918
Kind of EARy, isn't it? Get it? EAR-y?

73
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,877
CARLOS!

74
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,439
All l've got to say is,

75
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,990
if l meet anybody l can see through, l'm out of
here.

76
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,878
No need to be hasty, Arnold!

77
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,035
That is some doorbell!

78
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,315
Oh well, nobody home. Let's go...

79
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,231
Good idea! l'm with Arnold!

80
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,515
But l need to know what made that sound...

81
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,033
Come on.

82
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,076
How nice! Shall we...?

83
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,349
Must we?

84
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,714
Open! Open! Open!

85
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,955
lt's stuck! What do we do now?

86
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,557
We say...Halloo-oo-oo-ooo...!

87
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,116
That sounds friendly enough!

88
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,359
What a place!

89
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,671
We've got to phone for help. Oh, good. Here's
a phone book.

90
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,910
What was that?

91
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,310
That was a tantalizing tintinabulation!

92
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,192
No!! Don't!

93
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:59,151
Ah! Foghorn. One of my favorites! Such a
big, deep sound!

94
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,596
Maybe one of these books was making the
sound l heard.

95
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:08,035
That's it! l don't need to know how this turns
out. l'm outta here!

96
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,195
What kind of place is this?

97
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,079
l wonder who lives here...

98
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,992
Lived here, Keesha.

99
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,998
Professor Cornelia C. Contralto eccentric and
collector of sounds.

100
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,558
Born 1807, disappeared 1892!

101
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,512
How do you know that, Ms Frizzle?

102
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:37,879
Because after she vanished, they turned her
house, this house, into... the Sound Museum!

103
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,952
This is the Sound Museum?

104
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,679
l knew it! We've missed the rehearsal!

105
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,199
Wh...Where is everyone?

106
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:50,832
Gone for the night, Tim, which means we have
the whole place to ourselves!

107
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,354
Oh boy!

108
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,953
Oh boy...

109
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:05,195
Professor Contralto devoted her entire life to
sound.

110
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,358
What happened to her?

111
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,188
No one knows...

112
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,431
l bet you anything she's a ghost,

113
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,399
wandering around this house, seeking the
perfect sound...

114
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,913
Ghost?

115
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,194
''...seeking the perfect sound...'' Just like me!

116
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:29,751
Well, Carlos, you'll have plenty of time to find
it! We're spending the night.

117
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,034
The night? Here?

118
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,669
But our permission slips didn't say anything
about haunted houses!!

119
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:40,790
Besides, there's no place for us to... sleep!

120
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,877
Why, look. Eight student-sized beds...

121
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,675
...and a teacher-sized annex...

122
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,355
lt's almost as if someone were...expecting
us...

123
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,553
Be sure to get lots of rest, class. We have a
concert tomorrow.

124
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,353
Now maybe it'll sound like a ghost...

125
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,394
Carlos, that's the ploopiest yet.

126
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,359
lt's too late. You'll never find a sound now...

127
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,556
Cornelia, if you're out there, will you help me
make this thing sound right?

128
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,877
Uh, Carlos? Ms Frizzle said if you kept asking
questions, you'd keep getting answers.

129
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,433
W-w-was that an answer...?

130
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,396
No, but THAT was...

131
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,029
Don't be silly. lt's just... Yikes!!

132
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,432
A CRAZED GHOST!!

133
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,792
BOUND FOREVER lN THE CHAlNS OF
ETERNAL TORMENT!!!

134
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,790
COMlNG TO GET US!!

135
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,552
Listen..it's...it's...

136
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,915
Yeah, yeah. Terrifying. We know.

137
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,151
No!! lt's...the call of Cornelia...

138
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,912
Carlos, where are you going??

139
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,833
l've got to find out what's making that sound!

140
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,717
Um shouldn't somebody tell Ms. Frizzle?

141
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,315
Yikes!!

142
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,829
Listen!! lt's getting louder!!

143
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:21,597
And, according to my research, if it's getting
louder, we're getting closer.

144
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,233
ls that good or bad?

145
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,116
Bad

146
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,712
WHAT lS THAT?

147
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,993
lt's coming from in there. l'm going in...

148
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,908
No, Carlos, NO!!

149
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,758
Wow

150
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,757
lncredible!

151
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,357
This is one weird house.

152
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,709
You mean your house...

153
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:01,511
doesn't have a jungle, an ocean, a city and an
alpine wonderland?

154
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,870
Nah. The landlord wouldn't go along with it.

155
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,757
TlM!

156
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,798
An echo! Maybe it was an echo we heard...

157
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,075
Yeah, but...But who made it?

158
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,237
Sorry class. Did l wake you?

159
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,515
Ms. Frizzle, was that you?

160
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:31,759
Yes! Nothing like a good yodel before bed!
TOODLE OODLE OODLE OOO!!

161
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,949
Listen! Listen! There it is again! The Call of
Cornelia!

162
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,877
How do we get out of here?

163
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,110
The only way is up!

164
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,554
Come along, class. Two by two, please.

165
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,788
Where are we?

166
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,632
Professor Contralto built every room

167
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,558
in this house to show different things about
sound.

168
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,354
Ah! Simply soundniferous!

169
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,269
Hey! l've always wanted to play a harp!

170
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,519
Look at that string moving back and forth!!

171
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,876
That, class, is a vibration! You can feel it!

172
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,229
Vibration!

173
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:28,758
Let's get the facts: When the string stopped
vibrating, the sound stopped...!

174
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,470
The vibration of the string -- THAT'S WHAT'S
MAKlNG THE SOUND!

175
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:42,112
Very good, Carlos! Sound is vibration! Hear it
- feel it!

176
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,033
Are ALL sounds made by something vibrating?

177
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,475
Good question, Carlos!

178
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,120
Come on, Phoebe! Let's try out that drum.

179
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,392
There's your answer, Carlos.

180
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:11,157
So l've got to make my instrument vibrate to
make my sound. But how?

181
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:16,195
As l always say, behind every successful
sound is a vibration!

182
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,353
What's happening?

183
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,714
Now what?!

184
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,994
YOW!

185
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,833
Can l look now?

186
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,237
Hey, it's showtime!!

187
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,275
Why the glasses?

188
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:40,592
You heard sound... you felt sound... now...

189
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,156
Carlos? What is it??

190
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,475
l CAN SEE SOUND!

191
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,591
Watch this!!

192
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,158
Look at me!!

193
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,429
Listen!

194
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,272
Hey, they're different!

195
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,319
Yeah! When you sing...

196
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,398
Look! There are lots of vibrations close
together.

197
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,392
But when you sing...

198
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,988
there are fewer vibrations, further apart.

199
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:26,949
Excellent! High sounds are made by
something vibrating fast...

200
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,911
And low by something vibrating slow...

201
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:37,916
You know what? These vibrations move kind
of like ripples on a pond...

202
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,150
The waves start in one place and move out in
all directions.

203
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:49,033
lf sound is a vibration and it moves through the
air in waves...

204
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,198
And different types of vibrations make different
sounds!

205
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,558
Stop the vibration, you stop the sound.

206
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:03,238
l've got it! lt doesn't matter how my instrument
looks - as long as it can VlBRATE!

207
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,796
DA, l know what to do! l've got to get my
instrument!

208
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,236
lt's gone!!!

209
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,679
Where could it be?

210
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,278
There's an explanation, class. The question
is, What is it?

211
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:40,833
First Carlos's instrument disappears... then
each of us.... one by one...

212
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,755
There's that sound again.

213
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,317
lt's coming from in... here!!

214
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,508
Carlos! Are you all right?

215
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,673
l'm fine! l'm just in some sort of dungeon or
something.

216
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:06,112
Well, if they torture you, don't tell them
anything!

217
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,909
l'll learn to be a lawyer and meet you back
here when we're grown-ups!

218
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,553
This way, Arnold!

219
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,718
let's go!

220
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,080
Coming Arnold? We're waiting.

221
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,033
l think l should've stayed home today...

222
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,793
Thanks, Ms Frizzle.

223
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,797
Don't mention it, Arnold.

224
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,551
Well, Carlos. You got us into this. Any ideas
how to get us out?

225
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:38,917
Listen

226
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,871
Where's it coming from?

227
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,314
lt's hard to hear exactly. Wait here!

228
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,757
lt's coming from along there!

229
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,910
He...he can't go down there alone!

230
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,679
You're right, Keesha! Why don't you go with
him?

231
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:59,276
C'mon, you buncha weasly wimps!! Let's
follow Ms Frizzle...

232
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:11,920
You can see the soundwaves bouncing off the
walls. There...from there...

233
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,436
From there!

234
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:18,190
Sound waves bouncing... l bet that's how an
echo is made!

235
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,349
Those soundwaves are travelling THROUGH
that door!

236
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,000
Good observation, Dorothy Ann!

237
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,516
Just so long as we don't travel through that
door.

238
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,319
No! We've got to see what it is!

239
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,317
Hello....

240
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,753
lt WAS you!

241
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,799
Wait a minute! ls it just me or are you... are
you a...?

242
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,874
Professor Cornelia C. Contralto... the Second.

243
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,077
That is my great-grandmother.

244
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,590
Now, listen. You've got a concert tomorrow,
right?

245
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,358
Are you ready to make your instrument sound
richly resonant

246
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,351
and resoundingly reverberant?! Huh?

247
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,910
How'd she know about Carlos's instrument?

248
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,391
You asked a question...

249
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,669
Let's see...

250
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,716
Don't you mean let's hear....?

251
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,355
Right! To make a sound, l need to make
something vibrate.

252
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,388
My instrument couldn't vibrate because there
was too much stuff on it!

253
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:29,550
Neither did that. l don't need this, pull this
thing off.

254
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,512
l think he has got it!

255
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,151
Ready Carlos?

256
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,429
Go!

257
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:59,556
Bravo!! Virtuoso performance!

258
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,471
Carlos, that was the perfect sound!

259
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,715
Thanks, DA...

260
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,395
And so, young man, if it's all right with you,

261
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:14,675
l would like to add that wonderful sound to my
grandmother's collection!

262
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,399
Well, l couldn't have done it without you, Dr.
Contralto...!

263
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:21,519
As l always say -- hit it, Cornelia!!

264
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,154
ls it the magic school bus?

265
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,392
ls it the magic school bus?

266
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,674
ls it the magic school bus?

267
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,710
ls it the magic school bus?

268
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,438
ls it the magic school bus?

269
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:00,399
stay tune with us and be a smart kid

270
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,679
Hello? Magic School Bus.

271
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,991
Hi. Are you the one responsible for that show
on 'sound'?

272
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,075
You might say that, yes...

273
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,077
Well, what's the deal with that house?

274
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,193
l mean, you could never see sound. lt goes
way too fast.

275
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:26,114
Oh, you're right. That's why they had magic
glasses.

276
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,553
l don't get something,

277
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,757
lf sound is a vibration, just what's doing the
vibrating?

278
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:36,637
The air, a sound is made when something
pushes back and forth from the air...

279
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,518
and makes the air vibrate,

280
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:44,509
this vibration travels through the air to your ear
as a sound wave.

281
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,909
So a loud sound is just a big vibration?

282
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:52,319
Right! And a soft sound is a very tiny vibration.

283
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,949
And what about our ears? You hardly
mentioned them.

284
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,031
Ears are very important.

285
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:03,148
They turn sound waves into something our
brain can handle. That's how you hear.

286
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,118
But not everybody's ears work the same, do
they?

287
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,998
My grandmother wears a hearing aid to help
her hear better.

288
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:12,993
And some people can't hear anything, ever,
even with a hearing aid.

289
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,999
They use their brains with their other senses
to replace hearing.

290
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,634
And another thing...

291
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:23,030
there are lots of differences in sounds besides
loudness and pitch.

292
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:28,393
A violin and a saxophone sound very different,
even when they're playing the same note.

293
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:35,232
True! There are enough different kinds of
sounds to fill the world,

294
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,873
but we only had a half an hour

295
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,556
...and we had to leave room for all those
hilarious jokes.

296
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:46,435
-Okay. But one last thing -Yes?

297
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,391
About that ghost...

298
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,831
Well, that can't have been true.

299
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,999
l mean, everybody knows there's no such thing
as ghosts...

300
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,757
Certainly not!

301
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,913
THE END
