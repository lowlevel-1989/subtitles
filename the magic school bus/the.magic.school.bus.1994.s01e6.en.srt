Eeew!

38
00:01:19,133 --> 00:01:21,500
Is that some kind of rot or what?

39
00:01:21,867 --> 00:01:23,934
That is one rotten orange, Ralphie.

40
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:27,033
It's so disgusting, it
could win the contest.

41
00:01:33,066 --> 00:01:36,567
Ah, the smell of decomposing orange.

42
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,467
Oh, delectable.

43
00:01:42,567 --> 00:01:44,000
So what's my score, Tim?

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Do I win the most disgusting,
grossest rot contest ever?

45
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,233
Two nose holds and a faint.

46
00:01:53,633 --> 00:01:54,633
Good one, Ralphie.

47
00:01:54,767 --> 00:01:56,100
Woohoohoo!

48
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,367
Definitely disgusting.

49
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,834
Let's see,

50
00:02:01,066 --> 00:02:02,567
Yup, this should do it.

51
00:02:05,033 --> 00:02:05,834
Next!

52
00:02:06,667 --> 00:02:08,133
How about this, Tim?

53
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,767
It fell behind the counter
when I was still at my old school.

54
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,467
Eww, Phoebe!

55
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,000
That banana's so rotten, it's mush.

56
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:17,133
Score?

57
00:02:20,367 --> 00:02:21,900
That's three nose holds.

58
00:02:22,033 --> 00:02:23,367
Congratulations.

59
00:02:25,767 --> 00:02:26,667
Next!

60
00:02:28,233 --> 00:02:30,066
Wait until you see this!

61
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,133
Wanda, what is in there?

62
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,033
I don't know, Carlos.

63
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,367
 Nobody knows.

64
00:02:37,467 --> 00:02:39,567
It's been in the fridge since I was four.

65
00:02:39,633 --> 00:02:40,500


66
00:02:40,967 --> 00:02:42,800
Just beautiful.

67
00:02:43,767 --> 00:02:45,800
You're not gonna open it are you?

68
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,200
Of course she is.

69
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,233
Come on, class.

70
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,800
Don't you wanna see
what rip-roaring rot's inside?

71
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:55,200
Here goes.

72
00:02:55,767 --> 00:02:58,000


73
00:02:58,767 --> 00:02:59,400
Oh!

74
00:02:59,467 --> 00:03:00,233
Yuck!

75
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:04,233
Score, please.

76
00:03:06,567 --> 00:03:07,767
Three faints.

77
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,166
Very good, Wanda.

78
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,333
We've got us a winner!

79
00:03:11,667 --> 00:03:15,900
And to congratulate you on winning
the most disgusting rot contest,

80
00:03:16,033 --> 00:03:17,433
I have a little prize.

81
00:03:21,767 --> 00:03:25,734
Oh, Wanda, it's a baby tree.

82
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,667
Miss Frizzle, I really
like it and everything,

83
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,166
But it's not really rotten, is it?

84
00:03:33,433 --> 00:03:35,333
It's so... alive.

85
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:38,000
That's right, Keisha.

86
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:39,700
It's very alive.

87
00:03:40,033 --> 00:03:41,567
And so is rot.

88
00:03:41,633 --> 00:03:43,166
It is?

89
00:03:43,367 --> 00:03:44,734
Mmm-hmm.

90
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,834
Well Wanda, what would
you like to do with your prize?

91
00:03:48,567 --> 00:03:52,567
Um... I guess
I'd like to plant it.

92
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:55,867
And I know just the spot.

93
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,967
You know that old lot
near my house, on Decatur?

94
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,834
An excellent place for a new tree.

95
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:03,133
To the bus!

96
00:04:03,266 --> 00:04:04,467
Two by two, please.

97
00:04:07,767 --> 00:04:12,233
Now Wanda, you really wanna put
your nice tree in that ugly old lot?

98
00:04:12,533 --> 00:04:13,166
Correct.

99
00:04:13,533 --> 00:04:16,767
But it's filled with lots of dead stuff.

100
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,433
Rotting logs, tree stumps,

101
00:04:19,667 --> 00:04:21,300
That's the point, Carlos.

102
00:04:21,533 --> 00:04:24,367
We could make that lot beautiful.

103
00:04:24,867 --> 00:04:29,066
Just clear out all the dead stuff
and plant my lovely green tree.

104
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,266
Think how great this
tree will look when it's big.

105
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,500
It could be a little park, and
we could call it Wanda World.

106
00:04:36,533 --> 00:04:37,700
No, wait, no, wait, no, wait.

107
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,734
Why not do something really cool with it?

108
00:04:41,233 --> 00:04:43,333
What about a theme park?

109
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,000
Yeah, cool.

110
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:45,967
Theme park?

111
00:04:46,233 --> 00:04:47,533
Now wait a minute.

112
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,633
Yes, and the theme could be Rot.

113
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:51,934
What?

114
00:04:52,233 --> 00:04:54,133
And we'll call it Rotland.

115
00:04:54,567 --> 00:04:55,200
Yeah!

116
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,233
Oh, interesting notion.

117
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,533
Any other thoughts?

118
00:04:58,667 --> 00:04:59,834
I know, I know.

119
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,467
Let's build a restaurant.

120
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,333
Yeah, a fast food joint.

121
00:05:05,734 --> 00:05:08,934
I hate to say this, but restaurants
and theme parks mean litter.

122
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,200
Garbage everywhere.
Think of the environment.

123
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,433
Hmm,

124
00:05:13,934 --> 00:05:16,800
So let's build a recycling center.

125
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:18,600
A what?

126
00:05:18,767 --> 00:05:19,900
Oh, no.

127
00:05:20,633 --> 00:05:22,400
That's a great idea, Phoebe.

128
00:05:22,767 --> 00:05:23,900
No, it's not.

129
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,233
Hey, there's the lot!

130
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,400
Miss Frizzle, I'm going
to go out and have a look.

131
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,000
Certainly, Wanda.

132
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:35,433
Take chances!

133
00:05:35,567 --> 00:05:37,000
Get messy!

134
00:05:37,133 --> 00:05:38,500
Make mistakes!

135
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,600
Woohoo! This is more than I thought.

136
00:05:43,667 --> 00:05:45,667
There's a lot of stuff to get rid of.

137
00:05:48,433 --> 00:05:49,900
Hey guys!

138
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,100
A tunnel of rot!

139
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,266
Specials for veggies!

140
00:05:53,266 --> 00:05:54,567
Junk sculpture!

141
00:05:54,567 --> 00:05:59,300
Hello, excuse me, I have an announcement.

142
00:06:04,233 --> 00:06:05,300
We need help.

143
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:07,033
Huh?

144
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,133
Larry's Log Away.

145
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,667
The log removal service
that won't leave you stumped.

146
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,166
Perfect.

147
00:06:17,467 --> 00:06:21,533
Oh, I can't wait to see their faces when
I get this place all cleaned up.

148
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:24,233
Hello.

149
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,667
Oh, hi, is this Larry's Log Away?

150
00:06:26,667 --> 00:06:27,333
You got him.

151
00:06:28,133 --> 00:06:30,000
Right, I have a job for you.

152
00:06:30,266 --> 00:06:33,100
We need to get rid of
some useless dead log.

153
00:06:33,133 --> 00:06:35,200
 Sure, I can do that. Where is it?

154
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,567
A lot on Decatur.

155
00:06:36,934 --> 00:06:38,433
Ooh, how about if I come now?

156
00:06:38,433 --> 00:06:40,033
Yeah, that will be just great!

157
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,133
Listen, the theme park
could have a slime ride.

158
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:44,900
Forget it.

159
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,200
This neighborhood needs a restaurant.

160
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:51,266
We can argue about what
to do after the lot is clear.

161
00:06:51,266 --> 00:06:52,266
Hold it!

162
00:06:52,433 --> 00:06:54,767
Why not just leave
this place the way it is?

163
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:00,300
Arnold, why do you always want to leave
things alone instead of doing something?

164
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,200
I have this theory that if you leave nature alone,

165
00:07:04,667 --> 00:07:06,100
It'll get along just fine.

166
00:07:06,734 --> 00:07:08,867
Forget your theories, Arnold.

167
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,967
That rotten log has to go.

168
00:07:11,033 --> 00:07:13,633
It's dead. It's useless.
I mean, look at it!

169
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:16,867
And that, Wanda, is exactly what we shall do.

170
00:07:17,533 --> 00:07:18,734
Seat belts, everyone.

171
00:07:19,467 --> 00:07:22,367
Wanda, now look what you've done.

172
00:07:22,834 --> 00:07:24,600
The Frizz is going to...

173
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,367
No, no way.

174
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:27,567
This puzzle...

175
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,166
You're not going to...

176
00:07:29,567 --> 00:07:30,867
We really shouldn't.

177
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,667
We can't!

178
00:07:36,266 --> 00:07:37,834
Whoa!

179
00:07:39,266 --> 00:07:40,333
Too late, Wanda.

180
00:07:41,533 --> 00:07:42,600
Keep strong.

181
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:46,467
Oh no, not now.

182
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:50,667
What did I do? What did I do?!

183
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:58,967
But Miss Frizzle, we've got to get out of here.

184
00:07:59,266 --> 00:08:00,000
Now!

185
00:08:00,533 --> 00:08:02,000
Where are we going?

186
00:08:02,233 --> 00:08:05,500
We're going to find out what Wanda
brought us to do with life, Wanda.

187
00:08:05,633 --> 00:08:07,567
But do we have to find out now?

188
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,633
Okay, class.

189
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,033
Everybody out!

190
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:13,867
Take chances. Make mistakes. Get messy.

191
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,900
Wahoo!

192
00:08:16,133 --> 00:08:19,033
Yeah, make mistakes. My specialty.

193
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:21,133
Wow!

194
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:25,000
A dead log sure looks different
when you're no bigger than a bug.

195
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,000
And the bugs are different too, right Liz?

196
00:08:33,133 --> 00:08:35,066
Wow! Look at that!

197
00:08:35,233 --> 00:08:36,734
Rot! Life!

198
00:08:36,967 --> 00:08:38,934
Okay, let's go back now.

199
00:08:38,934 --> 00:08:40,000
Lighten up, Wan.

200
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,700
Last one up's a centipede!

201
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,266
No! Wait!

202
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,834
Please, don't go up there!

203
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,734
We've got to gooooooo!

204
00:08:48,367 --> 00:08:49,000
What's that?

205
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:52,266


206
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:55,066
That, class, is a chipmunk.

207
00:08:55,266 --> 00:08:55,767
Hi!

208
00:08:58,033 --> 00:09:00,100
Wanda? Where are you?

209
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,734
I'm over here!

210
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,066
Ah, thanks, Miss Fizzle.

211
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,734
Ah, Don't mention it, Wanda.

212
00:09:11,767 --> 00:09:14,533
Wow! It's another world up here!

213
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:17,100
Whoa!

214
00:09:18,033 --> 00:09:20,133
The perfect look for Rotland!

215
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,233
But we can't do anything
until we take this log away.

216
00:09:23,433 --> 00:09:26,100
So let's get big again and get out of here.

217
00:09:26,367 --> 00:09:28,567
Hey! Where do you think this goes?

218
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,000
It goes down, Ralphie.

219
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,533
Okay now, us, we want to go home.

220
00:09:32,667 --> 00:09:33,900
Single file, class.

221
00:09:34,367 --> 00:09:37,367
Our rotten field trip has only just begun.

222
00:09:39,467 --> 00:09:41,567
Not if I have anything to say about it.

223
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,467
Hey, everyone!

224
00:09:44,567 --> 00:09:47,133
Uh, there's a great log in my backyard!

225
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,400
Why don't we go there for our field trip?

226
00:09:49,867 --> 00:09:51,567
I'll serve cookies and milk.

227
00:09:55,867 --> 00:09:57,800
Wanda, we're here,

228
00:09:57,967 --> 00:10:02,000
Because you pointed to this
log and said, and I quote,

229
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,000
"Just look at it!"

230
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,567
Remember?

231
00:10:06,633 --> 00:10:09,400
I took a chance. I made a mistake.

232
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,867
So how do I stop it from
getting really messy?

233
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,233
No sign of Larry the Log Away guy?

234
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:22,700
Huh?

235
00:10:23,533 --> 00:10:24,667
Yikes!

236
00:10:25,967 --> 00:10:28,500
Whoa!

237
00:10:31,633 --> 00:10:33,800
Really have to get out of here!

238
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,734
What's that sound?

239
00:10:35,934 --> 00:10:37,333
Oh, don't worry class.

240
00:10:37,633 --> 00:10:39,633
Woodpeckers only eat bugs.

241
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,800
Wow!

242
00:10:41,567 --> 00:10:44,000
There are hundreds of tunnels down here.

243
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,066
How about a tunnel tour in Rotland?

244
00:10:47,233 --> 00:10:49,367
Grreat idea, D.A.!

245
00:10:49,467 --> 00:10:53,467
Forget Wanda World, let's build Rotland
and I say, "Start right away!"

246
00:10:53,633 --> 00:10:55,100
Let's go!

247
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,066
Hey! Look at that!

248
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,633
It's coming this way!

249
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:00,066
Look out!

250
00:11:02,266 --> 00:11:03,266
Well done class.

251
00:11:03,533 --> 00:11:05,433
You found a Bessie bug,

252
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,200
One of the animals which made all these tunnels.

253
00:11:09,734 --> 00:11:10,633
Great!

254
00:11:10,767 --> 00:11:13,400
Here's a bus! We can go now.

255
00:11:16,266 --> 00:11:17,800
A Bessie bus?

256
00:11:18,233 --> 00:11:20,433
Now I've seen everything.

257
00:11:27,633 --> 00:11:31,834
This place keeps getting
more and more amazing!

258
00:11:32,433 --> 00:11:33,066
Uck!

259
00:11:33,633 --> 00:11:34,900
What's this stuff?

260
00:11:35,734 --> 00:11:39,133
Those are part of the mushrooms
we saw on the outside of the log.

261
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:43,000
Some mushrooms grow on dead wood.

262
00:11:43,467 --> 00:11:49,133
Underneath the mushroom caps, a tangle
of tiny threads grows throughout the wood.

263
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,000
These threads eat the
wood and help rot the log.

264
00:11:59,033 --> 00:11:59,567
Hey!

265
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,200
This thread effect could be good
for the haunted house in Rotland.

266
00:12:06,834 --> 00:12:08,433
He's back!

267
00:12:08,567 --> 00:12:10,166
You did say just bugs?

268
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,467
Right, Miss Frizzle?

269
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:13,533
Yes, Ralphie.

270
00:12:16,567 --> 00:12:18,700
Phew! That was close!

271
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,367
Who would have known a
dead log could be so alive?

272
00:12:22,934 --> 00:12:23,934
Right, Miss Frizzle?

273
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,800
I'm sorry, but I don't think we should stay in a
place where we might become somebody's lunch.

274
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,834
I told you we should have
left well enough alone.

275
00:12:32,934 --> 00:12:35,633
And I'm telling you, we have to
get out of here before...

276
00:12:35,633 --> 00:12:38,066
Wahoo!

277
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,233
Miss Frizzle?

278
00:12:39,433 --> 00:12:40,900
Too cool!

279
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,767
Come on!

280
00:12:41,834 --> 00:12:43,467
No, D.A., let go!

281
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,667
Wait!

282
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,800
Whoa!

283
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,400
I bet you never thought an <i>amoeboid
plasmodium</i> ecould be so much fun!

284
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,533
A what?

285
00:12:55,867 --> 00:12:57,300
A slime mold.

286
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,166
It's another living
thing living off the log.

287
00:13:00,633 --> 00:13:01,834
Think of it, D.A.

288
00:13:02,233 --> 00:13:08,000
The stunningly stupendous, super
slime slide found exclusively at...

289
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,166
Shh!

290
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,200
Rotland.

291
00:13:13,367 --> 00:13:14,400
No, Carlos.

292
00:13:14,633 --> 00:13:16,834
Found naturally in a dead log.

293
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:20,700
Which is stunningly
stupendous just the way it is.

294
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:21,767
Right!

295
00:13:22,133 --> 00:13:22,734
Wait!

296
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,467
What about taking this log away?

297
00:13:24,533 --> 00:13:25,433
Sorry, Wanda.

298
00:13:25,533 --> 00:13:26,700
We've changed our minds.

299
00:13:26,867 --> 00:13:28,467
Hey, hey, Carlos, D.A.

300
00:13:28,633 --> 00:13:30,734
Welcome to the Leave It As It Is Club.

301
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Okay then, it's settled.

302
00:13:33,266 --> 00:13:35,000
We'll do the restaurant instead.

303
00:13:35,133 --> 00:13:36,033
Now let's go!

304
00:13:38,934 --> 00:13:39,867
What was that?

305
00:13:40,133 --> 00:13:42,266
Hey, wait! You're going the wrong way!

306
00:13:44,367 --> 00:13:46,567
It gets worse and worse.

307
00:13:46,934 --> 00:13:48,467
Lunchtime class!

308
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,667
All right!

309
00:13:49,834 --> 00:13:52,000
Nothing like a rotten log that's catered!

310
00:13:52,567 --> 00:13:54,000
So what will it be?

311
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,667
Log nuggets, wood dumplings, pureed bark?

312
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:58,900
Huh?

313
00:14:00,033 --> 00:14:03,033
Um, I hate to be
picky, Ms. Frizzle, but,

314
00:14:03,233 --> 00:14:05,767
Do you have anything
in the way of food?

315
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,033
But the log is food, Ralphie.

316
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,100
That's the beauty of it.

317
00:14:11,233 --> 00:14:15,000
All these creatures use
the log for food and energy.

318
00:14:15,667 --> 00:14:16,934
Fine, fine.

319
00:14:16,934 --> 00:14:19,300
So let's just get out of here
and open our restaurant.

320
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,066
Right, Ralphie?

321
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:23,800
Whoa.

322
00:14:23,834 --> 00:14:25,734
Not only does stuff eats the log,

323
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,233
But stuff eats the stuff that eats the log.

324
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,000
Yeah.

325
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:32,233
Everywhere you look
around here, it's lunchtime.

326
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,066
You know something, Keisha?

327
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,967
This place is already a restaurant.

328
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,000
What?

329
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,633
Sorry, Wanda, but we don't
want to clear it away anymore.

330
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,667
Yes!

331
00:14:43,033 --> 00:14:46,000
Two more for the Keep
The Log The Way It Is Club.

332
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:48,600
Okay, so no Rotland, no restaurant.

333
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:51,700
So let's get big and argue some more!

334
00:14:51,834 --> 00:14:52,834
Why argue?

335
00:14:53,066 --> 00:14:56,166
Five out of eight kids say we
shouldn't take this log away.

336
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,467
One more chance to
get everybody out of here.

337
00:15:04,433 --> 00:15:05,834
Phoebe, Tim!

338
00:15:06,066 --> 00:15:13,467


339
00:15:13,567 --> 00:15:17,000
This reminds me of the
mush my banana turned into.

340
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,533
The process of decomposition
breaks everything down!

341
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:24,533
Be it wood, banana, or bug.

342
00:15:25,767 --> 00:15:27,133
Phoebe!

343
00:15:27,767 --> 00:15:31,867
Phoebe, Tim, I can honestly
say that your recycling center idea

344
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,867
Is the best ever in
the history of the earth.

345
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:34,500
Really?

346
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:35,467
You bet.

347
00:15:36,133 --> 00:15:41,667
So please, please tell Ms. Frizzle that you
want to get big to recycle this log, please?

348
00:15:44,567 --> 00:15:46,800
But it's already being recycled, Wanda,

349
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,834
As food for fungi and bugs.

350
00:15:50,233 --> 00:15:52,367
As a place for mosses and lichens to grow.

351
00:15:53,467 --> 00:15:56,600
And as a home for all sorts of creatures.

352
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,400
Okay, okay, but all these creatures
leave a lot of litter, don't they?

353
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:03,900
You know bug plops, so the
quicker we clear it out-

354
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:04,734
Wait!

355
00:16:05,266 --> 00:16:07,233
The bug plops are being used too.

356
00:16:10,066 --> 00:16:12,000
Natural recycling.

357
00:16:12,433 --> 00:16:14,867
I'm sorry, but that is gross.

358
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:16,934
Oh, it's not gross, Wanda.

359
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,567
It's another addition to decomposition.

360
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,467
Ooh, I give up.

361
00:16:23,667 --> 00:16:26,100
Okay, it's not gross,
it's perfect, I love it.

362
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,700
Now let's just get out of here!

363
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,700
Hey everyone, over here!

364
00:16:31,967 --> 00:16:32,934
Now what?

365
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,000
Look! Beautiful, rich soil.

366
00:16:39,367 --> 00:16:41,233
Perfect for your tree, Wanda.

367
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,000
Now will you join the
Leave It As It Is Club?

368
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,700
I don't believe it.

All right, I see it now!

381
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,767
There's absolutely no
reason to take this log away.

382
00:17:26,533 --> 00:17:27,867
Except one,

383
00:17:28,033 --> 00:17:29,800
Yeah, Wanda, which one's that?

384
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:30,633
Larry.

385
00:17:30,867 --> 00:17:31,667
Who's Larry?

386
00:17:32,767 --> 00:17:36,600
Ah!

387
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,900
Let's get out of here!

388
00:17:43,867 --> 00:17:44,834
This way, class.

389
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,266
What's that?!

390
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:47,500
Stay with your partners.

391
00:18:04,767 --> 00:18:07,500
Wanda, is there something you'd like to tell us?

392
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,133
I'm sorry, really I am.

393
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,200
I didn't know when I
called Larry, but I know now.

394
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,834
Why do I always have to do something
when I should just leave well enough alone?

395
00:18:19,934 --> 00:18:23,066
Frizzle: Sometimes action has a
certain attraction, Wanda.

396
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:25,967
And now is one of those times!

397
00:18:26,734 --> 00:18:28,000
I got it!

398
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,667
Good idea!

399
00:18:33,967 --> 00:18:35,467
Hey! Help!

400
00:18:47,533 --> 00:18:48,967
Put these on. And hurry!

401
00:18:49,066 --> 00:18:50,900
You have got to be joking.

402
00:18:51,433 --> 00:18:53,800
You want us to wear these things?

403
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,667
Do you have a better idea?

404
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,100


405
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:04,567
Seat belts, everyone!

406
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,700
Here we go!

407
00:19:25,133 --> 00:19:27,767
Larry! Larry!

408
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:28,834
Who's that?

409
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,667
Hmm.

410
00:19:35,467 --> 00:19:38,433
What on earth do you think
you're doing, Lawrence?

411
00:19:38,633 --> 00:19:39,867
I am uh...

412
00:19:40,266 --> 00:19:44,600
I'm from the Organization
of Log Gremlins, local 119.

413
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,867
You are?

414
00:19:48,066 --> 00:19:55,400
And frankly, the OLG doesn't like people coming
along and unnecessarily shaking things up.

415
00:19:55,834 --> 00:19:59,400
Tell me, Larry, what do you
see when you look around here?

416
00:19:59,834 --> 00:20:02,867
Well, I see a routine rot removal.

417
00:20:03,233 --> 00:20:04,633
Well, look again!

418
00:20:05,133 --> 00:20:06,233
See that dead log?

419
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:13,867
Did you know it's a theme park, a restaurant, a
recycling center, and Wanda World all rotted into one?

420
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,567
You wouldn't believe how
many creatures live in there!

421
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,900
And you know what else?

422
00:20:19,033 --> 00:20:20,467
Huh. No.

423
00:20:21,033 --> 00:20:21,700
What else?

424
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,633
They are nature's rot squad, Larry.

425
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,800
Rot is a wonderful thing
and necessary thing.

426
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:33,367
Rot is nature recycling itself,
creating the new friendly OLG.

427
00:20:37,233 --> 00:20:38,600
Whoa!

428
00:20:39,533 --> 00:20:40,600
I get it.

429
00:20:40,867 --> 00:20:43,367
Is there a hidden camera
around here someplace?

430
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,166
Come on, you guys.

431
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,233
Face it, Lawrence.

432
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:54,967
Removing this log is an
imposition on decomposition.

433
00:20:55,133 --> 00:20:59,467
I had no idea rotting logs had
such eloquent spokesgremlins.

434
00:21:08,633 --> 00:21:12,000
But how come I never heard them before?

435
00:21:12,066 --> 00:21:12,600
Yow.

436
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:16,600
Oh boy, I probably shouldn't
be operating heavy machinery.

437
00:21:17,433 --> 00:21:21,567


438
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,700
That gremlin idea was a
stroke of genius, Wanda.

439
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Thanks, Arnold.

440
00:21:33,133 --> 00:21:34,567
But I'll tell you something.

441
00:21:34,867 --> 00:21:37,934
From now on, I'm gonna
leave well enough alone.

442
00:21:42,066 --> 00:21:45,667
Wanda, what should we do? What
should we do? What should we do?

443
00:21:45,834 --> 00:21:46,934
Come on, Arnold.

444
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:50,133
Everybody, back on the bus.

445
00:21:50,266 --> 00:21:51,300
What?

446
00:21:57,066 --> 00:22:00,033
Um, do you two have any particular plans for that?

447
00:22:00,867 --> 00:22:03,433
Odiferous collection of rot.

448
00:22:03,633 --> 00:22:05,967
Rot is an important part of nature.

449
00:22:06,066 --> 00:22:06,600
Right?

450
00:22:06,967 --> 00:22:07,800
Right.

451
00:22:08,567 --> 00:22:12,333
And one of its uses is to
provide food for other living things.

452
00:22:12,767 --> 00:22:14,667
So, who's up for a picnic?

453
00:22:15,266 --> 00:22:16,166
Yuck!

454
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,367
But Wanda, Arnold, that's disgusting.

455
00:22:19,767 --> 00:22:21,266
Not if you're my tree.

456
00:22:23,533 --> 00:22:25,900
Yum, yum, compost.

457
00:22:26,233 --> 00:22:31,300
As I always say, it doesn't
have to be delicious to be nutritious.

458
00:22:31,567 --> 00:22:36,233


459
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,567


460
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,400


461
00:22:42,533 --> 00:22:43,734
Is this the Magic School Bus?

462
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,133
Is this the Magic School Bus?

463
00:22:45,133 --> 00:22:46,867
Magic School Bus?
Magic School Bus?

464
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:49,500
 Magic School Bus?

465
00:22:49,567 --> 00:22:50,533
Magic School Bus?

466
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,000
Magic School Bus?

467
00:22:52,433 --> 00:22:54,000
I want the Magic School Bus!

468
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:56,367
I want the Magic School Bus!

469
00:22:57,633 --> 00:23:09,433


470
00:23:09,767 --> 00:23:13,100
Ugh, Liz, you can't bring that in here!

471
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,266
Hello, hello.

472
00:23:15,667 --> 00:23:17,834
Hello, Magic School Bus.

473
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:22,200
Hi. Are you responsible for that
show I just saw on decomposition?

474
00:23:22,533 --> 00:23:23,233
Get that a-

475
00:23:23,533 --> 00:23:24,400
Why do you ask?

476
00:23:24,567 --> 00:23:26,000
Because it was rotten!

477
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:29,166
No kidding.

478
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,233
No, wait, I was kidding.

479
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:34,100
I've got to tell you, I've seen
some rotten things in my time,

480
00:23:34,266 --> 00:23:36,300
But they're not always
filled with bugs and fungus.

481
00:23:36,633 --> 00:23:42,266
Um, well that's because a lot of rot
is caused by things too small to see.

482
00:23:42,633 --> 00:23:46,300
We wanted to shrink down to the
size of bacteria, but Arnold wouldn't go.

483
00:23:48,734 --> 00:23:50,400
Is there anything that doesn't rot?

484
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,867
Not if it was once alive.

485
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:55,867
Plants, animals, bacteria, they
all decompose after they die.

486
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,567
Even the rotters eventually rot.

487
00:23:58,834 --> 00:24:00,133
Okay, so tell me this.

488
00:24:00,266 --> 00:24:02,266
There's a fallen log across
the street from my house.

489
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,400
That's been there since last summer.

490
00:24:04,633 --> 00:24:05,567
When is it gonna rot?

491
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:09,333
It's already decomposing,
but rot can take a long time.

492
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,300
Years even.

493
00:24:10,734 --> 00:24:14,166
But it will eventually return to the
soil, just like the log in the show.

494
00:24:14,633 --> 00:24:17,400
Like I said, almost everything rots.

495
00:24:17,767 --> 00:24:21,500
Yeah, how come you almost totally
ignored one of my favorite creatures?

496
00:24:21,633 --> 00:24:23,100
I did, which one?

497
00:24:23,934 --> 00:24:25,300
The earthworm.

498
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,633
Funny you should say that.

499
00:24:27,834 --> 00:24:29,633
Earthworms should not be ignored.

500
00:24:31,834 --> 00:24:32,533
Never.

501
00:24:32,633 --> 00:24:36,166
Earthworms are very good at
eating and plowing and improving soil.

502
00:24:36,734 --> 00:24:39,000
Then that's what they should be left to do.

503
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,300
You know, I was thinking,
what if there were no rot?

504
00:24:42,667 --> 00:24:44,367
If nothing rotted, ever.

505
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,834
Then the soil wouldn't get back
the nutrients that plants need to grow.

506
00:24:47,967 --> 00:24:52,133
Most plants would die and the Earth
would become barren like a desert.

507
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,867
And you know what?

508
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,333
What?

509
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,667
There are no such things as log gremlins.

510
00:25:04,233 --> 00:25:06,000
Depends on whom you talk to.

511
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:06,934
