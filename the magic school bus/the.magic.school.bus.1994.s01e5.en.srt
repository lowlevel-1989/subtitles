Bella.

00:01:38,767 --> 00:01:39,400
Hmm.

45
00:01:39,467 --> 00:01:40,834
How do you think you'll like it here?

46
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:42,066
Nope.

47
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:43,333
Not here.

48
00:01:46,767 --> 00:01:48,400
We made it, Bella!

49
00:01:48,667 --> 00:01:49,500
Bella.

50
00:01:50,367 --> 00:01:52,333
Could somebody open the door, please?

51
00:01:52,633 --> 00:01:53,834
Good morning, Wanda.

52
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,967
Need some help?

53
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,567
Thank you, Miss Frizzle.

54
00:01:58,667 --> 00:01:59,734
Oh, don't mention it.

55
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,900
You know, Miss Frizzle,

56
00:02:01,066 --> 00:02:05,133
I was really glad when you said I could bring
my best friend, Bella the bullfrog to school.

57
00:02:06,767 --> 00:02:07,767
Phew!

58
00:02:10,533 --> 00:02:14,600
Between you and me, I don't think she
liked being cooped up in my bedroom.

59
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,467


60
00:02:18,467 --> 00:02:21,200
Ah, did Bella need more
space in her home, Wanda?

61
00:02:21,633 --> 00:02:22,934
Absolutely.

62
00:02:23,133 --> 00:02:27,333
Our classroom is so perfect. Lots of space!

63
00:02:28,233 --> 00:02:31,867
I hope you don't mind, but I brought a
few things to make Bella feel more at home.

64
00:02:31,934 --> 00:02:35,200
Well, Wanda, an animal's
habitat is its home.

65
00:02:35,367 --> 00:02:36,600
Arnold: Uh, Wanda?

66
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Excuse me.

67
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,600
But that's my desk.

68
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,600
Arnold, today is your lucky day.

69
00:02:42,767 --> 00:02:46,433
So, why don't you and Bella get
acquainted while I unpack her stuff.

70
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,266
Bella!

71
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,367
Okay, but she better not give me trouble.

72
00:02:52,367 --> 00:02:54,000
All right, let's see now.

73
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:55,500
There!

74
00:02:55,867 --> 00:02:57,000
What is this?

75
00:02:57,266 --> 00:02:59,333
Her bean bag frog.

76
00:02:59,633 --> 00:03:00,900
It keeps her company.

77
00:03:02,133 --> 00:03:02,633
Hmm.

78
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:05,567
I'm sure Bella will be very hoppy here.

79
00:03:05,734 --> 00:03:06,900
Get it, hoppy?

80
00:03:07,867 --> 00:03:09,400
Carlos!

81
00:03:10,266 --> 00:03:14,567
Thing is, when Bella gets too
hoppy, she knocks things over.

82
00:03:15,266 --> 00:03:16,233
Uh-huh.

83
00:03:16,266 --> 00:03:19,133
1776, 1777,

84
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,433
So I think if we-

85
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:21,734
Hey, watch out!

86
00:03:22,133 --> 00:03:22,700
Clear!

87
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,000


88
00:03:24,133 --> 00:03:26,000
A nice, big space for her.

89
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,900
She won't get in anyone's way.

90
00:03:28,066 --> 00:03:28,934
Uh-uh, Wanda.

91
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,800
No way you're moving the rabbits.

92
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,033
They've just settled down into their habitat.

93
00:03:33,266 --> 00:03:36,367
They've got their water,
their food, and their shelter.

94
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:37,433
Okay, Tim.

95
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,433
But if Bella hops in their
roof, don't blame me.

96
00:03:40,767 --> 00:03:43,500
Bella, meet rock. Rock, meet Bella.

97
00:03:45,967 --> 00:03:46,734
Bella!

98
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,500
No doubt about it.

99
00:03:48,834 --> 00:03:50,767
You two were meant for each other.

100
00:03:51,367 --> 00:03:53,433
So, Bella, what else do you need?

101
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:54,867
A little fresh air?

102
00:03:55,233 --> 00:03:55,934
Bella!

103
00:03:55,934 --> 00:03:58,900
Arnold, can you bring
that pool back over here?

104
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:00,000
Stay.

105
00:04:05,734 --> 00:04:06,600
Thanks, Arnold.

106
00:04:06,767 --> 00:04:09,000
Your desk is where I'm putting
Bella's swimming pool.

107
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,233
Swimming pool?

108
00:04:10,367 --> 00:04:11,300
Of course!

109
00:04:11,367 --> 00:04:13,333
Everyone knows frogs need water!

110
00:04:13,667 --> 00:04:14,800
So start blowing.

111
00:04:15,066 --> 00:04:16,066
She's right, Arnold.

112
00:04:16,433 --> 00:04:20,867
But this desk is part of
<i>my </i>habitat, and I like it dry.

113
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,600
Arnold, trust me, you'll love having Bella here!

114
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:24,533
Now blow.

115
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,633


116
00:04:29,834 --> 00:04:30,834
Okay, Bella.

117
00:04:31,033 --> 00:04:33,567
Welcome to your happy new home.

118
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:34,767
Bella?

119
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:35,734
Huh?

120
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,767
Okay, Arnold. Where's Bella?

121
00:04:39,033 --> 00:04:40,400
Over there, with my rock.

122
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,333
Where?

123
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:45,133
Bella?

124
00:04:46,266 --> 00:04:48,667
Arnold, Bella's gone.

125
00:04:48,867 --> 00:04:49,467
Gone?

126
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,700
Where?

127
00:04:50,767 --> 00:04:52,000
Out the window.

128
00:04:52,066 --> 00:04:53,633
Arnold, did you open it?

129
00:04:53,934 --> 00:04:57,266
Well, yes, but I thought
she could use some air.

130
00:04:57,667 --> 00:04:58,500
What?

131
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,333
Nice one, Arnold.

132
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:02,367
Why would Bella leave?

133
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,900
It's so perfect here!

134
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,400
Maybe she needed more from my habitat than
a duck mug and a bean bag shaped like a frog.

135
00:05:09,433 --> 00:05:12,300
Tim, those were her special things.

136
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,100
I've got to find her, and
you've got to help me.

137
00:05:16,433 --> 00:05:17,000
What?

138
00:05:17,266 --> 00:05:18,200
Wanda?

139
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,767
Miss Fizzle, could we be
excused to go look for Bella?

140
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,133
Oh, that's an excellent idea, Wanda.

141
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:27,100
In fact, why don't we make it a...

142
00:05:28,266 --> 00:05:29,734
Oh, no!

143
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,066
Field trip.

144
00:05:41,467 --> 00:05:44,100
I think I should have stayed home today.

145
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,600
I think <i>Bella</i> should
have stayed home today.

146
00:05:46,834 --> 00:05:48,567
How are we ever going to find her?

147
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,367
She could have hopped anywhere.

148
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,800
Not exactly anywhere, Wanda.

149
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,266
As I always say,

150
00:05:55,266 --> 00:05:57,800
To find a frog, be a frog.

151
00:05:59,834 --> 00:06:00,667
Be a frog?

152
00:06:01,133 --> 00:06:02,000
Oh, no.

153
00:06:02,533 --> 00:06:03,800
That means we're going to...

154
00:06:04,033 --> 00:06:05,700
Shrink!

155
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:11,533
Woah!

156
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,266


157
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,734
Hey! Take it easy!

158
00:06:18,934 --> 00:06:19,834
Miss Frizzle?

159
00:06:20,367 --> 00:06:23,633
Maybe Bella just hopped
out to find some food.

160
00:06:23,734 --> 00:06:27,967
Oh, that is definitely a speculation
worth consideration, Wanda.

161
00:06:28,233 --> 00:06:29,100
What kind of food?

162
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,133
Cornflakes? Mallow blasters?

163
00:06:31,233 --> 00:06:32,800
Bugs, Arnold.

164
00:06:32,967 --> 00:06:34,000
Ew!

165
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,367
Maybe we should hop to the
nearest bug habitat and have a look.

166
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,433
What do you say, class?

167
00:06:39,667 --> 00:06:43,934
Uh, Miss Frizzle, do we have to hop?

168
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,000
Everybody out!

169
00:06:53,033 --> 00:06:54,633
Where are we?

170
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,000
Phew, we stopped!

171
00:06:57,567 --> 00:06:58,667
Bella!

172
00:06:58,867 --> 00:07:01,700
Bella! Where are you?

173
00:07:02,367 --> 00:07:04,467
Bella!

174
00:07:04,467 --> 00:07:06,066
Wanda, be quiet!

175
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:07,500
You'll scare her away!

176
00:07:07,533 --> 00:07:10,200
Thanks to you, she's already away, Arnold.

177
00:07:10,467 --> 00:07:12,333
The question is where?

178
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:14,133
Bella!

179
00:07:15,133 --> 00:07:15,867
Bella?

180
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,066


181
00:07:18,433 --> 00:07:19,900
Hop along, class.

182
00:07:20,433 --> 00:07:21,567
Two by two, please.

183
00:07:21,734 --> 00:07:23,000
Woohoo!

184
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,133
Here we go!

185
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:36,633
Hey, this place is crawling with frog food.

186
00:07:36,633 --> 00:07:39,300
Woah! Woah!

187
00:07:40,533 --> 00:07:41,300
Urrg!

188
00:07:41,533 --> 00:07:43,700
Do we have to keep talking about food?

189
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,266
Oh, sorry, Ralphie.

190
00:07:45,567 --> 00:07:49,533
But food is one of the things all plants
and animals need from their habitats.

191
00:07:49,767 --> 00:07:51,867
So, here's the food, Arnold.

192
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,367
Where's Bella?

193
00:07:53,467 --> 00:07:55,400
I'm looking, I'm looking.

194
00:07:58,667 --> 00:08:01,900


195
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,100
Oh, look! It's a <i>felis catus</i>.

196
00:08:05,767 --> 00:08:07,734
Miss Frizzle!

197
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,133
Oh, this is an excellent opportunity to
study the predatory behavior of cats!

198
00:08:12,133 --> 00:08:15,133


199
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,867
Well, if you insist, here we go.

200
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,734
Wahoo!

201
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Woah!

202
00:08:22,066 --> 00:08:23,600
We're in a tree?

203
00:08:23,767 --> 00:08:24,700
Don't worry, Wanda.

204
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,233
It's just a little mishop.

205
00:08:26,467 --> 00:08:27,800
Class: Carlos!

206
00:08:28,934 --> 00:08:29,533
Mrow.

207
00:08:29,533 --> 00:08:31,266
Not a mishop, Carlos.

208
00:08:33,033 --> 00:08:35,400
A tree is a wonderful habitat!

209
00:08:35,533 --> 00:08:39,567
According to my research, it's a
perfect place for birds and squirrels.

210
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,834
Yeah, it gives them a safe place
away from cats to build their nests.

211
00:08:46,834 --> 00:08:47,834
Oh, look.

212
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,000
Baby squirrels.

213
00:08:52,233 --> 00:08:55,000
But I don't want baby squirrels, I want Bella.

214
00:08:55,066 --> 00:08:56,967
And there's not enough space for her here.

215
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,400
There's no food!

216
00:08:59,133 --> 00:09:01,667
Besides, where would
she put her swimming pool?

217
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:02,867
I don't know.

218
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,133
How about over there?

219
00:09:05,967 --> 00:09:07,433
Very funny, Ralphie.

220
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:12,166
Come on, Arnold. Let's see
if we can see it from up here.

221
00:09:14,233 --> 00:09:15,200
But, Wanda?

222
00:09:16,667 --> 00:09:17,433
There she is.

223
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,100
Look!

224
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,333
Bella!

225
00:09:20,233 --> 00:09:21,967
Bellaaaaaa!

226
00:09:22,033 --> 00:09:22,967
No, wait!

227
00:09:23,033 --> 00:09:24,600
Bellaaaaaaaaaa!

228
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,734
Wanda, wait!

229
00:09:25,867 --> 00:09:26,633
Be careful!

230
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:28,934
Wanda!

231
00:09:32,934 --> 00:09:34,667
What do we do now, Wanda?

232
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,367
Help!

233
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,100
Yikes!

234
00:09:51,934 --> 00:09:53,867
Oh, no!

235
00:09:56,667 --> 00:09:59,433
That wasn't Bella, Wanda.

236
00:09:59,734 --> 00:10:01,200
So, I knew that.

237
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:04,633
Then, why are we here?!

238
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,867
Wanda, Arnold,

239
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,433
I can't have you two
hanging out here all day.

240
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,500
Come along, now.

241
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,300
Waaaa!

242
00:10:20,567 --> 00:10:22,100


243
00:10:22,233 --> 00:10:23,800
Here we go again.

244
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,300
Oh, we're here.

245
00:10:43,767 --> 00:10:44,834
But is Bella here?

246
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,467
Because if she isn't, Arnold.

247
00:10:47,467 --> 00:10:48,266
Look, Wanda.

248
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,100
Water!

249
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,600
And bugs!

250
00:10:52,934 --> 00:10:54,467
What do you think, class?

251
00:10:55,734 --> 00:10:58,467
Does this spot have everything Bella needs?

252
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,734
So far so good, Ms. Frizzle.

253
00:11:01,934 --> 00:11:04,433
Water, space, bullfrog food.

254
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:06,367
Then Bella must be here.

255
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:08,433
Bella!

256
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,800
Whoa!

257
00:11:11,033 --> 00:11:12,700
Not again!

258
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,700
Bella!

259
00:11:18,567 --> 00:11:20,300
Whoa!

260
00:11:22,033 --> 00:11:24,867
Help!

261
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,867
We're coming!

262
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,166
Whoa!

263
00:11:36,433 --> 00:11:38,633
That's not the kind of water Bella needs.

264
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:40,133
It's moving too fast.

265
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:43,300
Yeah, I'm telling you, if
Bella laid eggs in this water,

266
00:11:43,367 --> 00:11:46,734
They'd be two miles downstream
before you could say, "Ribbit."

267
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,967
Excellent observation, Ralphie.

268
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,133
Bullfrogs need quiet
water to lay their eggs in.

269
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,800
So, all we have to do is find quiet water.

270
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,000
Just as I thought.

271
00:11:58,367 --> 00:12:00,500
It can't be too far away now.

272
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:03,066
Wow!

273
00:12:03,133 --> 00:12:04,066
What is that?

274
00:12:04,767 --> 00:12:06,500
One of my favorite birds.

275
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:11,500
It's an <i>Ardea herodias</i>, a great blue heron.

276
00:12:11,967 --> 00:12:13,600
Look how it soars.

277
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:16,100
What grace, what style.

278
00:12:16,433 --> 00:12:18,600
What does that have to do with Bella?

279
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:23,233
Well, Wanda, as I always
say, look for connections.

280
00:12:23,433 --> 00:12:25,433
Arnold, you look for connections.

281
00:12:25,767 --> 00:12:27,166
I'm looking for Bella.

282
00:12:27,433 --> 00:12:29,633
Bella, where are you?

283
00:12:29,834 --> 00:12:30,667
That's it.

284
00:12:31,066 --> 00:12:31,767
I’m sorry.

285
00:12:32,066 --> 00:12:33,934
But I can’t take the pressure.

286
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,667
Aw, come on, Arnold.

287
00:12:35,867 --> 00:12:37,000
We can do it.

288
00:12:37,033 --> 00:12:38,934
Yeah, think connections!

289
00:12:39,033 --> 00:12:40,233
Connections.

290
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,033
Um,

291
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,133
Food!

292
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,166
Fight!

293
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,467
No, no, no.

294
00:12:44,734 --> 00:12:45,633
Start over.

295
00:12:45,734 --> 00:12:46,233
Um,

296
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:47,467
Bugs?

297
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,700
Food.

298
00:12:48,967 --> 00:12:49,467
Fight!

299
00:12:49,767 --> 00:12:51,300
Carlos!

300
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,467
We give up, Miss Frizzle.

301
00:13:03,767 --> 00:13:05,000
What's the connection?

302
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,633
Try this class.

303
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,667
Where do herons live?

304
00:13:08,967 --> 00:13:10,567
In the heron habitat, of course.

305
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,500
And where do beavers live?

306
00:13:12,867 --> 00:13:13,767
Beavers?

307
00:13:14,467 --> 00:13:16,433
Herons? Beavers?

308
00:13:16,567 --> 00:13:18,033
Where is all this going?

309
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,500
The question is, Arnold,

310
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,734
Where are <i>they</i> all going?

311
00:13:26,367 --> 00:13:27,800
A beaver pond.

312
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,033
Wait a minute.

313
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:32,300
The water in a beaver pond is nice and quiet!

314
00:13:36,533 --> 00:13:38,367
Bella!

315
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:43,266
Wanda, Wanda!

316
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,734
This place has everything Bella needs.

317
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,133
Food, space, and quiet water.

318
00:13:48,367 --> 00:13:49,900
She's got to be here.

319
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,433
And when I find her, I'm never
letting her out of my sight again.

320
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:56,467
Bella!

321
00:13:56,667 --> 00:13:58,266
Wanda, not so loud.

322
00:13:58,367 --> 00:13:59,166
Look, guys.

323
00:13:59,467 --> 00:14:01,500
The beavers are working on their dam.

324
00:14:01,867 --> 00:14:03,367
They're making their own habitat.

325
00:14:08,934 --> 00:14:09,667
Bella!

326
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,567
There she is!

327
00:14:13,667 --> 00:14:14,967
Bella!

328
00:14:15,367 --> 00:14:19,033
Arnold, we found her! We
found her! We found her!

329
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:21,633
Wanda, do you always have to shout?

330
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,300
Hang on, Bella!

331
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,700
I'm coming!

332
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,367
Bella!

333
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,000
Oh, Bella.

334
00:14:29,233 --> 00:14:31,734
It's so good to see you!

335
00:14:34,533 --> 00:14:37,000
I missed you so much.

336
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:40,934
Look, I brought your bean
bag to remind you of home!

337
00:14:42,567 --> 00:14:45,934
Um, is it just me or does
that heron look hungry?

338
00:14:45,934 --> 00:14:46,934
Yikes!

339
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,133
Wanda!

340
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,333
What is it with you, Arnold?

341
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,433
Can't you see I'm talking to Bella?

342
00:14:56,233 --> 00:14:58,000
Okay, now where were we?

343
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,266
Bella?

344
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,200
Wanda!

345
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,266
Wanda! Wanda!

346
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:13,367
Look guys!

347
00:15:15,233 --> 00:15:16,066
What happened?

348
00:15:17,633 --> 00:15:18,567
Are you all right?

349
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,467
Of course I am.

350
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,266
But, where's Bella?

351
00:15:22,567 --> 00:15:24,000
Bella!

352
00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:25,700
There she is, Wanda.

353
00:15:25,934 --> 00:15:27,300
She's fine.

354
00:15:27,867 --> 00:15:28,734
Bella!

355
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:30,767
Okay, that's it.

356
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,333
We're all in one piece.

357
00:15:32,433 --> 00:15:34,300
Time to go.

358
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,834
Not until I get my frog.

359
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,567
But Wanda, look at the facts.

360
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,934
A beaver pond is Bella's natural habitat.

361
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,867
It's the right place for her to live.

362
00:15:43,533 --> 00:15:44,000
Right?

363
00:15:44,367 --> 00:15:45,767
You call this right?

364
00:15:45,834 --> 00:15:47,467
But where are the comforts of her home?

365
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,333
Her plastic duck mug, her s-

366
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:51,867
Wanda, Bella doesn't need all that stuff.

367
00:15:52,233 --> 00:15:53,333
Let's go.

368
00:15:53,567 --> 00:15:54,934
Arnold, stop pushing me.

369
00:15:54,934 --> 00:15:55,834
Look, Wanda,

370
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,367
This place has everything Bella needs.

371
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,000
Delicious food.

372
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:03,734
Beautiful calm water to
swim and lay her eggs in.

373
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:05,800
Lily pads to sit on.

374
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,900
And lots of space to hop around in.

375
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,467
Bella!

376
00:16:11,367 --> 00:16:13,266
This may have everything Bella needs,

377
00:16:13,533 --> 00:16:16,333
But it also has something
she definitely does not need.

378
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,066
Plants are eaten by insects.

379
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,467
Insects are eaten by fish
and newts and bullfrogs.

380
00:16:25,233 --> 00:16:28,300
And fish and bullfrogs and
nuts are eaten by herons.

381
00:16:28,567 --> 00:16:30,800
They're all part of the
same pond food chain.

382
00:16:32,834 --> 00:16:34,433
Don't you get it, Arnold?

383
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,533
Bella's in danger.

384
00:16:36,834 --> 00:16:38,700
Not necessarily, Wanda.

385
00:16:38,867 --> 00:16:40,734
The heron might eat Bella.

386
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:42,433
If it could catch her.

387
00:16:42,934 --> 00:16:47,800
And I might have an anxiety
attack if we don't get out of here.

388
00:16:47,867 --> 00:16:49,166
Forget it, Arnold.

389
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,834
I will not leave Bella here
to get speared by a heron.

390
00:16:54,767 --> 00:16:57,500
Bella, there may not be
as much space at school!

391
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:00,700
Or the right kind of bugs!

392
00:17:03,233 --> 00:17:05,333
Or a pond full of water!

393
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,100
But at least there's no heron there!

394
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,900
Wanda, do you really want to
take Bella away from her habitat?

395
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:16,667
She belongs here.

396
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,033
Well then, if Bella belongs here,

397
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,166
So do I.

398
00:17:22,533 --> 00:17:24,000
Oh, Wanda.

399
00:17:24,133 --> 00:17:26,000
And my friends,

400
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,066
Can you help me watch out for the heron?

401
00:17:28,367 --> 00:17:30,000
Come on, Wanda.

402
00:17:30,233 --> 00:17:31,333
Get real!

403
00:17:31,533 --> 00:17:33,667
You almost got yourself drowned.

404
00:17:34,066 --> 00:17:35,233
Don't worry, Wanda.

405
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,266
Bella's in her own habitat.

406
00:17:37,433 --> 00:17:39,800
And we're going home to ours!

407
00:17:42,266 --> 00:17:44,233
Oh no, it's the heron!

408
00:17:44,367 --> 00:17:45,734
Hide!

409
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,800
Bella, don't worry.

410
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,333
I'll protect you!

411
00:17:54,834 --> 00:17:56,800
Oh no, not again.

412
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,433
Bella!

413
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,667
Wanda!

414
00:18:16,133 --> 00:18:19,000
Arnold, she must be hiding.
I can't find her anywhere.

415
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:22,567
Hey, if we can't find Bella, then maybe...

416
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,767
The heron can't either!

417
00:18:26,967 --> 00:18:27,567


418
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,633
Come on! Let's get out of here!

419
00:18:33,233 --> 00:18:34,500
Are you guys okay?

420
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,400
Is the heron gone?

421
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,867
It flew away!

422
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,934
Thank goodness you're all right.

423
00:18:40,633 --> 00:18:43,066
Well, Wanda, did you manage to protect Bella?

424
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,867
We didn't have to, Miss Frizzle!

425
00:18:44,934 --> 00:18:46,767
You should have seen her.

426
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,600
Bella used her habitat and hid.

427
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:54,000
An important part of a frog's
habitat is a good place to hide.

428
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:54,734
I knew that.

429
00:18:58,834 --> 00:19:01,533
Bella, way to hide!

430
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:02,633
Herman.

431
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Herman?

432
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,533
Herman?

433
00:19:09,033 --> 00:19:09,900
Bella!

434
00:19:10,467 --> 00:19:11,900
Well, what do you know?

435
00:19:11,967 --> 00:19:13,367
Bella has a friend.

436
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,033
Bella and Herman.

437
00:19:15,467 --> 00:19:16,867
How romantic.

438
00:19:17,133 --> 00:19:21,367
Oh no, we'll never get
two frogs back to school!

439
00:19:22,767 --> 00:19:23,900
You're right, Arnold.

440
00:19:23,967 --> 00:19:25,867
So I'm not even going to try.

441
00:19:26,767 --> 00:19:27,233
You're not?

442
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,567
You guys were right.

443
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:31,633
If I really love Bella, and I do,

444
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,667
I have to make sure she
has everything she needs.

445
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,000
And it's all here!

446
00:19:37,233 --> 00:19:44,400
Space, food, quiet water,
shelter from herons, and Herman.

447
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,233
Herman.

448
00:19:45,834 --> 00:19:46,500
Bella!

449
00:19:47,233 --> 00:19:50,800
Soon there will be the
splisher splasher of little tadpoles.

450
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,200
Oh, I love hoppy endings.

451
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:54,100
Don't you?

452
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,800
Carlos!

453
00:19:57,367 --> 00:19:58,800
So, let's go now.

454
00:19:59,133 --> 00:20:01,300
Only no more hopping, okay?

455
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,834
No, wait!

456
00:20:02,934 --> 00:20:04,900
Wanda, now what?

457
00:20:05,266 --> 00:20:06,800
Relax, Arnold.

458
00:20:06,934 --> 00:20:08,567
I just want to say goodbye.

459
00:20:12,934 --> 00:20:13,700
Bye, Bella.

460
00:20:14,467 --> 00:20:16,667
I know you're going to
have a good life here.

461
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,867
But I am going to miss you.

462
00:20:20,367 --> 00:20:21,133
Bella!

463
00:20:21,533 --> 00:20:22,433
Bella!

464
00:20:23,033 --> 00:20:25,000
Yeah, I know you'll miss me too.

465
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:31,500
And I know you don't <i>need</i> this, but
here's something to remember me by.

466
00:20:31,633 --> 00:20:33,800
And watch out for the great blue heron.

467
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:34,767
Okay?

468
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:36,200
Bella!

469
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:13,834
Ah, there we are, Wanda.

470
00:21:13,967 --> 00:21:15,000
Oh, finished.

471
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:16,233
Thanks, Miss Frizzle.

472
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:19,600
Okay, Arnold, you can
have your desk back now.

473
00:21:19,867 --> 00:21:20,734
Thanks.

474
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,000
Ah, it sure feels good to
be back in my own habitat.

475
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,133
Food, water, a roof
over my head, linoleum.

476
00:21:30,266 --> 00:21:31,834
Linoleum?

477
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,266


478
00:21:35,233 --> 00:21:36,633
What's wrong, Wanda?

479
00:21:37,033 --> 00:21:38,533
Got the bullfrog blues?

480
00:21:38,934 --> 00:21:40,734
Surprise!

481
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:45,567
What's that?

482
00:21:45,667 --> 00:21:49,333
Oh, it’s a <i>rana catesbieana no</i>
<i>hoppium out of the windocus</i>!

483
00:21:50,266 --> 00:21:51,300
A what?

484
00:21:51,367 --> 00:21:53,133
A frog that won't hop out of the window.

485
00:21:53,433 --> 00:21:54,667
And listen to this.

486
00:21:55,133 --> 00:21:57,166
Bella. Bella.

487
00:21:57,266 --> 00:21:58,767


488
00:22:01,734 --> 00:22:03,133
Thanks. I love it.

489
00:22:03,667 --> 00:22:05,133
And you know where I'm going to keep it?

490
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,834
Right where Arnold's desk is.

491
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,667
Now wait a minute, Wanda.

492
00:22:08,767 --> 00:22:09,867
Wait just one minute.

493
00:22:09,967 --> 00:22:11,133
Does it feel trees?

494
00:22:11,233 --> 00:22:12,600
And now where's that pool?

495
00:22:12,633 --> 00:22:14,266
Arnold, move that over here.

496
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,500


497
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:19,700
As I always say, habitats
are meant to be shared.

498
00:22:19,867 --> 00:22:22,066
Wanda, we already did this.

499
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,367
Now, where did I put that duck mug?

500
00:22:24,567 --> 00:22:25,233
Wanda.

501
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,200


502
00:22:29,133 --> 00:22:35,033


503
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,567


504
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,400


505
00:22:42,533 --> 00:22:43,734
Is this the Magic School Bus?

506
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,133
Is this the Magic School Bus?

507
00:22:45,133 --> 00:22:46,867
Magic School Bus?
Magic School Bus?

508
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:49,500
 Magic School Bus?

509
00:22:49,567 --> 00:22:50,533
Magic School Bus?

510
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,000
Magic School Bus?

511
00:22:52,433 --> 00:22:54,000
I want the Magic School Bus!

512
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:56,300
I want the Magic School Bus!

513
00:23:09,633 --> 00:23:10,333
Bye Bella.

514
00:23:10,367 --> 00:23:14,467
I know you're going to have a good
life here, but I am going to miss you.

515
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,967
Bella! Bella!

516
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:23,600
Hello.

517
00:23:23,734 --> 00:23:25,934
Is this the producer of
the Magic School Bus?

518
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,600
Yes, yes it is.

519
00:23:27,867 --> 00:23:30,000
Good, because I have some questions.

520
00:23:30,567 --> 00:23:31,200
Shoot.

521
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,533
Since when can a bus shrink
and sprout legs like a bullfrog?

522
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,166
Since the scriptwriter wrote it in
for the purposes of this episode.

523
00:23:41,033 --> 00:23:43,333
So you admit it can't really happen.

524
00:23:43,433 --> 00:23:46,800
Well, not in the world
as we know it, no, but...

525
00:23:46,934 --> 00:23:49,700
And what about the business
of a stream turning into a pond?

526
00:23:49,934 --> 00:23:51,400
That takes ages, doesn't it?

527
00:23:51,834 --> 00:23:55,633
Well, it can take anywhere
from weeks to years.

528
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,133
But on this show, it only took minutes.

529
00:23:58,233 --> 00:24:02,000
Hey, if we take it any longer,
you would have changed channels.

530
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,667
Maybe, maybe not.

531
00:24:03,767 --> 00:24:06,200
And the stuff about beavers
making their own habitat,

532
00:24:06,533 --> 00:24:08,700
We humans do that too, don't we?

533
00:24:10,166 --> 00:24:11,700
Hey, that's my lunch.

534
00:24:11,734 --> 00:24:14,300
Um, yes, sometimes humans-

535
00:24:14,567 --> 00:24:15,500
And lizards,

536
00:24:16,734 --> 00:24:19,900
Change habitats so quickly that animal and plants-

537
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:21,567
And producers,

538
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,200
Whoa!

539
00:24:26,433 --> 00:24:28,367
Don’t have time to adapt or move.

540
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,533
So, how’s Bella doing in her new habitat, anyway?

541
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:32,934
Um, well, 

542
00:24:33,266 --> 00:24:35,467
She’s doing just fine, thanks.

543
00:24:35,567 --> 00:24:36,533
Just fine.

544
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,333
Great!

545
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,767
Well, thanks very much for your time. 

546
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:40,500
Bye.

547
00:24:40,734 --> 00:24:41,467
Goodbye.

548
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,533
Here, can I help you with that, Liz?

549
00:24:47,633 --> 00:24:50,400
Just want to keep everybody hoppy, get it Liz?

550
00:24:51,033 --> 00:24:51,800
Hoppy?

551
00:24:51,967 --> 00:24:53,166
