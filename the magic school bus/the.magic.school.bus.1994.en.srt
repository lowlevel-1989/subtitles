00:01:16,266 --> 00:01:17,467
OK, Ralphie.

39
00:01:19,233 --> 00:01:21,233
It's going to be a model
of the solar system.

40
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,200
Neat, huh, Janet?

41
00:01:22,633 --> 00:01:26,600
Uh, I hate to tell you, cousin Arnold,
but when my class built one,

42
00:01:26,633 --> 00:01:29,867
The sun was so huge, we
had to hang it from the flagpole.

43
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,400
And you had all nine planets?

44
00:01:32,667 --> 00:01:34,000
That's right, Keisha.

45
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,000
Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars,
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto.

46
00:01:39,133 --> 00:01:42,033
My class already started the solar system.

47
00:01:42,233 --> 00:01:46,500
I bet you your class didn't learn
about the aliens that live on the planets.

48
00:01:46,967 --> 00:01:50,934
For your information, Ralphie Earth
is the only planet that can support life

49
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,266
As far as we know. 

50
00:01:52,567 --> 00:01:54,433
And how far do you know?

51
00:01:54,667 --> 00:01:56,333


52
00:01:56,367 --> 00:01:59,800
Really far, because I got
straight A's on all my tests.

53
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,367
And this proves it.

54
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:06,033
If you already know so much, Janet,
why did you come to visit our class?

55
00:02:06,667 --> 00:02:12,133
Because Arnold told me all
about your "field trips," A-Dorothy Ann 

56
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:13,000
What did he say?

57
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:16,166
That they were and I
quote: "highly unusual."

58
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,667
And you know what I said?

59
00:02:18,567 --> 00:02:19,233
Prove it.

60
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:22,800
She's really nice,

61
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,233
Once you get to know her.

62
00:02:24,767 --> 00:02:27,000


63
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,266
Good morning, class.

64
00:02:29,633 --> 00:02:31,200
Have you all met Arnold's cousin?

65
00:02:31,233 --> 00:02:31,934
Janet?

66
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,800
 Yes, Ms. Frizzle.

67
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,367
My teacher doesn't dress like that.

68
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:42,033
That's nothing. Sometimes the Frizz
looks totally outrageous.

69
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,700
Well, since we're lucky
enough to have a guest today,

70
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'd say it's a perfect
time for a... Field trip!

71
00:02:49,066 --> 00:02:52,233


72
00:02:52,433 --> 00:02:55,100
Hey cuz', now's your chance to prove it.

73
00:02:57,967 --> 00:03:00,233
I wonder where we're going today.

74
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,100
Inside a rotten log, been there, 

75
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,900
To the bottom of the ocean, done that.

76
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,500
We're going to the planetarium?

77
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,467
Hardly unusual, Arnold.

78
00:03:11,867 --> 00:03:14,734
The Frizz taking us on a normal field trip?

79
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,567
Believe me, that's unusual.

80
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,166
Hmm, hmm, hmm.  How odd.

81
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,867
Closed today.

82
00:03:22,266 --> 00:03:23,133
Closed?

83
00:03:23,533 --> 00:03:26,867
Hmm, well, looks like we'll
just have to go back to school.

84
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:28,800
Oh, no!

85
00:03:30,367 --> 00:03:32,166
Some field trip, Arnold.

86
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,200
You know what?

87
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:35,166
My teacher would have called ahead.

88
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,133
Because my teacher planned ahead.

89
00:03:37,433 --> 00:03:39,300
My teacher never makes a mistake.

90
00:03:39,567 --> 00:03:41,800
My teacher is a zillion times better than-

91
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,066
Nobody is better than Ms. Frizzle.

92
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:46,333
Oh, yeah?

93
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,400
Prove it.

94
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,700
Stop the bus!

95
00:03:52,934 --> 00:03:58,433


96
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,567
Yes, Arnold?

97
00:03:59,767 --> 00:04:04,467
Isn't there... You know,
someplace else you could take us?

98
00:04:04,533 --> 00:04:07,000
You mean another planetarium?

99
00:04:07,533 --> 00:04:10,000
Well, sort of, but bigger.

100
00:04:10,433 --> 00:04:11,000
Bigger?

101
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,567
You know the big one.

102
00:04:13,734 --> 00:04:15,700
Oh, oh, Arnold.

103
00:04:16,233 --> 00:04:18,367
Why didn't I think of that?

104
00:04:18,867 --> 00:04:20,667
T-minus five and counting.

105
00:04:20,967 --> 00:04:25,834
Four, three, two, one, blastoff!

106
00:04:25,834 --> 00:04:29,033


107
00:04:29,033 --> 00:04:30,266
What's happening?

108
00:04:30,433 --> 00:04:32,000
A field trip!

109
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:37,967
Janet: Into outer space, highly unusual.

110
00:04:41,533 --> 00:04:43,834
Welcome to outer space, class.

111
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:48,467
The only planetarium open 24
hours a day, seven days a week.

112
00:04:48,734 --> 00:04:51,266
And how are all my astronauts doing?

113
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,000


114
00:04:53,367 --> 00:04:54,667
We're weightless!

115
00:04:55,066 --> 00:04:56,734
We're in trouble!

116
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,200
No, Arnold. We're in orbit around the Earth.

117
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:04,633
Hmm, let's see now. We are just about there.

118
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,867
Wonderful! Let the tour begin!

119
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,567
We're coming up to the sun.

120
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,767
Look how huge it is!

121
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,467
Class, are you all wearing your special,
heavy-duty sunblock 8,000 sun goggles?

122
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:24,166
I wonder how many Earths will fit in the sun.

123
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,433
Over a million!

124
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,333
Hold onto your goggles. Yeehaw!

125
00:05:28,367 --> 00:05:32,066


126
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,233
Now class, we've traveled
from Earth around the sun.

127
00:05:36,467 --> 00:05:38,300
And now we are on our way to-

128
00:05:38,433 --> 00:05:40,934
Janet: Mercury, the closest planet to the sun.

129
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
When I tell my class,
they're going to be so jealous.

130
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,300
Wow! We're landing!

131
00:05:50,367 --> 00:05:51,500
Of course.

132
00:05:51,767 --> 00:05:53,233
Arnold: Told you Janet.

133
00:05:57,233 --> 00:06:00,533
We hardly weigh anything
compared to my old planet Earth.

134
00:06:00,934 --> 00:06:04,633
I wonder if that means there's
less gravity pulling on us here.

135
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,233
Exactly, Keisha.

136
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:08,000
Good thinking.

137
00:06:09,533 --> 00:06:13,066
Come along, class.
Follow the bouncing lizard.

138
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,433
This way, please.

139
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000


140
00:06:17,266 --> 00:06:20,200
Bet I can jump higher than you, Dorothy Ann!

141
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,400
You're on!

142
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,300
I won first place in my
class jumping contest.

143
00:06:28,266 --> 00:06:30,000
Here's my blue ribbon to prove it.

144
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:34,767
Wait till I tell my class I won the
jumping contest on Mercury too.

145
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,567
But you know what they're going to say?

146
00:06:36,934 --> 00:06:38,000
What?

147
00:06:38,066 --> 00:06:39,233
Prove it.

148
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:44,166


149
00:06:48,633 --> 00:06:49,333
How on Earth?

150
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:52,300
I mean, how am I going
to prove I was on Mercury?

151
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,400
Man, the aliens on Mercury
sure make big footprints.

152
00:06:56,567 --> 00:06:58,533
Nothing can live on Mercury, Ralphie.

153
00:06:58,633 --> 00:07:00,033
It's too hot and dry during the day.

154
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:04,567
And according to my research,
way below freezing at night.

155
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,633
And day or night,
there's no air,

156
00:07:06,767 --> 00:07:10,533
Which makes it extremely
difficult  to breathe.

157
00:07:10,867 --> 00:07:13,433
Well, something had
to make tracks this big.

158
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:16,033
Something did, Ralphie, a meteorite.

159
00:07:16,467 --> 00:07:17,400
Hmm,

160
00:07:17,467 --> 00:07:21,900
Meteorites are pieces of stone or
iron that fall from space.

161
00:07:22,133 --> 00:07:23,166
Come along, class!

162
00:07:23,567 --> 00:07:26,633
If the ones that hit the
planet are called meteorites,

163
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:29,000
What do you call the ones that miss?

164
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:29,767
What?

165
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,667
Meteor-wroooooongs!

166
00:07:39,033 --> 00:07:39,900
Wow!

167
00:07:40,367 --> 00:07:42,033
Janet, what are you doing?

168
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,767
Hey, watch it!

169
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,867
Eureka! My very own meteorite!

170
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,934
When I show this to my
class, it'll prove I was on Mercury.

171
00:07:52,433 --> 00:07:54,367
Oh, Janet.

172
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,900


173
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:58,633
Wahoo!

174
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,533
We are now approaching Venus,
this second planet from the sun.

175
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,433
I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait!

176
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,300
Cool, Venus has clouds, just like Earth.

177
00:08:10,734 --> 00:08:13,066
Wow, what a view.

178
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:16,767
Uh, I think I'll go... sit down now.

179
00:08:22,266 --> 00:08:23,500
Come along, class!

180
00:08:24,066 --> 00:08:24,900
Hey!

181
00:08:25,533 --> 00:08:28,300
I feel like I weigh the
same here as I do on Earth.

182
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,333
That's because Venus
is about the same size of Earth,

183
00:08:31,567 --> 00:08:33,166
And has about the same gravity.

184
00:08:33,367 --> 00:08:34,567
Come on, Arnold.

185
00:08:35,967 --> 00:08:38,200
Check out those weird clouds.

186
00:08:40,433 --> 00:08:43,200
Oh, good, a little rain will
cool the place down!

187
00:08:43,266 --> 00:08:45,900
Except that's not rainwater
in those clouds, Wanda.

188
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,600
It's sulfuric acid.

189
00:08:47,667 --> 00:08:49,300
Sulfuric acid?

190
00:08:49,667 --> 00:08:50,400
Mm-hmm.

191
00:08:50,567 --> 00:08:52,166
It's a deadly poison.

192
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:54,500
Oh, we're perfectly safe!

193
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,000
As long as we keep our space suits on.

194
00:08:57,934 --> 00:09:01,400
I like rocks, but... this is ridiculous.

195
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,467


196
00:09:03,033 --> 00:09:05,266
Do you have to have all of these?

197
00:09:05,266 --> 00:09:09,066
Absolutely, if this doesn't prove
I was on Venus, nothing will.

198
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:22,266
We're now passing through the
orbit of the third planet, which is Earth.

199
00:09:22,767 --> 00:09:25,400
Look, it's so beautiful.

200
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,734
And there's air we can breathe,

201
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:31,066
And it's not too hot, or not too cold.

202
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,667
The only one that supports life.

203
00:09:36,266 --> 00:09:38,266
And coming up is Mars.

204
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,834
The fourth planet, right, <i>Ms</i>. Frizzle?

205
00:09:41,967 --> 00:09:43,667
Very good, Janet!

206
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,767
Ooh, you certainly do know your planets.

207
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,533
I got straight A's on all my reports.

208
00:09:49,667 --> 00:09:52,567
We know, we know, enough already!

209
00:09:53,934 --> 00:09:55,300
Oh, here we are, class!

210
00:09:55,734 --> 00:09:57,667
Take a look at Mars!

211
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,233


212
00:09:58,533 --> 00:10:00,600
How marvelous!

213
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,900
It looks like the whole place is rusting.

214
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,633
No wonder it's called the Red Planet!

215
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,767
As you can see, the soil here is
colored by red dust, which has iron in it.

216
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,667
Look at those cliffs of ice!

217
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,934


218
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,533
Ice climbing anyone?

219
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Wow, right.

220
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,600
No thanks. Too cold.

221
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:25,633
Too slippery.

222
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:29,533
Too right. Who wants to waste time
climbing up an old ice cap anyway?

223
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,266
Come on, cuz', we've got lots to do.

224
00:10:32,433 --> 00:10:34,834
Maybe I should have stayed home today.

225
00:10:37,734 --> 00:10:39,834
We've made it to the top!

226
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,100
I wonder if Mars could
have been another Earth.

227
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:44,000
If it had water, and wasn't so cold.

228
00:10:44,433 --> 00:10:49,000
Maybe. But as I always say,
Mars is the best place for ice cream.

229
00:10:49,367 --> 00:10:51,000
Ice cream? Where?

230
00:10:51,133 --> 00:10:54,367
Here. I screaaaaaam!

231
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,500


232
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,867
Let’s goooo!

233
00:11:01,867 --> 00:11:04,200
I screeeeeam!

234
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,934


235
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,133
Uh!

236
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,500
That's the last ice block.

237
00:11:14,667 --> 00:11:17,000
Great! Now for some red dust.

238
00:11:17,066 --> 00:11:19,533
On Earth, I had simple little chores: 

239
00:11:19,633 --> 00:11:23,200
Emptying wastebaskets, feeding the
fish, clearing the table.

240
00:11:24,367 --> 00:11:25,066
Oof!

241
00:11:25,834 --> 00:11:29,367
The only thing is, we've been to
Mercury, Venus, and Mars so far.

242
00:11:29,533 --> 00:11:32,000
And we haven't seen
a single... 

243
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,300
Alien!

244
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,767
Tell it we surrender!

245
00:11:43,667 --> 00:11:45,433
Hi, guys. Which way's the bus?

246
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,734
Arnold!

247
00:11:48,033 --> 00:11:50,166
I knew it was him the whole time.

248
00:11:50,367 --> 00:11:52,300



249
00:11:53,266 --> 00:11:56,433


250
00:11:56,433 --> 00:11:59,734
Mars ice and dust, enough
to prove we were on Mars.

251
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,166
Uh, no need to thank me.

252
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:05,100
I don't think there's much
chance of that, Janet.

253
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,834
Look! A flying potato!
Huh?

254
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
That's no potato.
It's an asteroid, Ralphie.

255
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,000
A hunk of space rock.

256
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Smaller than a moon,
but bigger than a meteorite.

257
00:12:16,266 --> 00:12:18,633
It's part of the asteroid belt,

258
00:12:18,734 --> 00:12:25,066
A ring of asteroids which divides our solar
system into the inner and outer planets.

259
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,533


260
00:12:28,533 --> 00:12:31,000


261
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Janet: An asteroid! 

262
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,667
I gotta have it!

263
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,900
Please, it'll only take me a second!

264
00:12:38,266 --> 00:12:39,367
Watch out!

265
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,367
What was that?

266
00:12:44,567 --> 00:12:45,767
What happened?

267
00:12:45,834 --> 00:12:47,100
What's going on?

268
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:48,834
Don't worry, class.

269
00:12:49,233 --> 00:12:51,533
Just an unexpected orbital interruption.

270
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,300
Let's just see where we are, shall we?

271
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:56,066
The map!

272
00:12:57,467 --> 00:12:58,667
It's gone!

273
00:13:00,533 --> 00:13:02,834
We're lost in space!

274
00:13:03,467 --> 00:13:07,033
Class: We're lost in space!

As I always say, there's nothing
a good space mechanic can't fix.

277
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,467
Wrench!
Wrench!

278
00:13:24,467 --> 00:13:25,233
Wires!

279
00:13:26,934 --> 00:13:28,433
An asteroid.

280
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,734
I mean... Wires!

281
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,567
Screwdriver!

282
00:13:36,033 --> 00:13:39,033
An asteroid! Perfect proof!

283
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:42,467
Ms. Frizzle, we've
got half of the map now.

284
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:46,000
Good. One more adjustment.

285
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,467


286
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,367
Miss Frizzle? Miss Frizzle!

287
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,734
Keep your claw on that button, Liz.

288
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:09,000
Up, up, and away!

289
00:14:10,867 --> 00:14:13,500
Um, bad news!

290
00:14:13,734 --> 00:14:16,600
Janet, we're not only lost in space, 

291
00:14:16,867 --> 00:14:19,400
We're lost in space without a teacher!

292
00:14:19,433 --> 00:14:22,166
What are we gonna do? What are
we gonna do? What are we gonna do?

293
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,467
Ms. Frizzle to class! Ms.
Frizzle to class! Come in!

294
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:28,667
No reason to panic. I'd never leave you.

295
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:31,700
I'm right here. I'll give you a hint.

296
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,100
I'm headed for one of the outer planets.

297
00:14:35,367 --> 00:14:37,767
But that's a half of the
map that we don't have.

298
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,600
Oh, good!
You can fill it in as you go along.

299
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,500
You've got a navigator who
knows the neighborhood.

300
00:14:44,934 --> 00:14:45,600
We do?

301
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,800
Of course. Janet.

302
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,867
I wonder if Miss Frizzle's down there.

303
00:14:56,133 --> 00:14:58,000
Ralph, which planet is that?

304
00:14:58,133 --> 00:14:59,433
One of the gas giants!

305
00:15:03,767 --> 00:15:05,467
What is that red blotch?

306
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,700
It's a storm. Thousands of miles wide.

307
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,567
And the only planet with a
big red spot is Jupiter.

308
00:15:13,867 --> 00:15:15,967
Jupiter, the fifth planet.

309
00:15:16,233 --> 00:15:19,633
Wow! Thanks, Janet! Way to go!

310
00:15:19,967 --> 00:15:24,600
Now if I could just get some of that red
spot, it would prove I've been to Jupiter!

311
00:15:25,266 --> 00:15:28,000
Miss Frizzle to bus!
Miss Frizzle to bus! Over!

312
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,467
Jupiter is the largest planet,
but don't worry, Carlos.

313
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,133
Because I'm not on it.

314
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,867
Then where are you?

315
00:15:35,934 --> 00:15:38,667
I've got to have some of that red spot!

316
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,467
We're out of control!

317
00:15:45,834 --> 00:15:46,600
Janet!

318
00:15:46,734 --> 00:15:48,467
Pull up! Pull up!

319
00:15:49,567 --> 00:15:51,300
It's all yours, Ralphie.

320
00:15:51,433 --> 00:15:53,433
Whoa!

321
00:15:58,867 --> 00:16:00,166
Janet!

322
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,000
Chill out, guys. If you've been to
Jupiter, you've got to have proof.

323
00:16:04,266 --> 00:16:04,767
Right?

324
00:16:04,934 --> 00:16:08,000
I knew I should have stayed home today.

325
00:16:08,066 --> 00:16:12,066
Ms. Frizzle to class!
Ms. Frizzle to class! Come in, please!

326
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,066
Miss Frizzle! Janet almost got us-

327
00:16:15,066 --> 00:16:17,200
I got them some of Jupiter's red spot.

328
00:16:17,667 --> 00:16:19,266
Did you say red hot?

329
00:16:19,367 --> 00:16:21,333
 You're not even warm yet.

330
00:16:21,667 --> 00:16:24,333
The outer planet I'm
on is very cold and dark.

331
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:28,300
The colder you get, the
warmer you'll be to finding me.

332
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,700
Oh great, now it's a riddle.
Off we go again!

333
00:16:34,033 --> 00:16:36,867
Hey look! Another planet!

334
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,800
It's beautiful!

335
00:16:39,033 --> 00:16:40,300
Where are we?

336
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:41,767
It's gotta be Saturn.

337
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:45,700
If there's no other gas
giant with such beautiful rings.

338
00:16:45,934 --> 00:16:48,667
Saturn! The sixth planet!

339
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,233
Well, it must be cold down there because
Saturn is pretty far away from the sun.

340
00:16:53,467 --> 00:16:55,700
But Miss Frizzle said cold and dark.

341
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,000
It could be very, very dark on Saturn.

342
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:03,033
Oh no, you don't.
You just want to grab more stuff.

343
00:17:03,233 --> 00:17:04,934
Hey, I'm just trying to help.

344
00:17:05,033 --> 00:17:08,400
If you want to play "Let's Find
Miss Frizzle Without a Map," 

345
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:11,266
For the rest of your
life, that's fine with me.

346
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:17,000
Janet's right. Miss Frizzle <i>could</i> be on Saturn.

347
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:17,867
Couldn't she?

348
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:22,300
Okay, Arnold, but it's your job to
keep your crazy cousin under control.

349
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,467
Miss Frizzle to bus! Miss Frizzle to bus! Over!

350
00:17:26,066 --> 00:17:32,533
Ah, Liz and I can't wait to show you
all the stars we can see out here.

351
00:17:32,767 --> 00:17:35,000
Oh, it's so beautiful!

352
00:17:35,233 --> 00:17:37,200
Come back! What about a hint?

353
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,800
She just gave us a hint, Ralphie!

354
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,000
She did?

355
00:17:41,233 --> 00:17:42,000
Yeah!

356
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,734
She can see the stars!

357
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,400
Which means she can't be on Saturn.

358
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,400
She could never see the stars
through all those storms and clouds.

359
00:17:51,934 --> 00:17:54,133
Planet number seven, coming up!

360
00:17:54,767 --> 00:17:56,300
That must be Uranus!

361
00:17:56,834 --> 00:18:02,934
You could tell by its tilted faint grey
rings and its blue-green gases.

362
00:18:04,066 --> 00:18:09,000
See, cuz', Uranus doesn't do a
thing for me so you can get off me.

363
00:18:09,033 --> 00:18:09,734
Okay?

364
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,900
Sorry, Janet, but I have
to stay on top of the situation.

365
00:18:14,133 --> 00:18:16,734
The Frizz couldn't see the stars
through those clouds either.

366
00:18:16,867 --> 00:18:18,700
No way she's on Uranus!

367
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,500
To the next planet.

368
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,500
Wait!

369
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,000
I need proof!

370
00:18:24,433 --> 00:18:28,166
And we need Miss Frizzle.
Step on it, Wanda.

371
00:18:28,266 --> 00:18:29,633
Hey, watch it!

372
00:18:30,767 --> 00:18:31,834
Neptune!

373
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:35,000
Please, we gotta stop at Neptune!

374
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,166
It's my favorite planet!

375
00:18:39,533 --> 00:18:40,700
The eighth planet.

376
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,900
Neptune.

377
00:18:43,533 --> 00:18:45,900
Looks like another planet
surrounded by gases.

378
00:18:46,734 --> 00:18:48,000
And it's blue.

379
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,266
Oh, my favorite color!

380
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:52,900
Forget it, Janet.

381
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,266
Miss Frizzle couldn't see
the stars from down there.

382
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,900
Go Wanda!

383
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,867
No!

384
00:19:04,767 --> 00:19:06,300
Now where do we go?

385
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:10,300
She's not on Jupiter, Saturn.
Uranus, or Neptune.

386
00:19:10,667 --> 00:19:13,133
That means there's only one planet left!

387
00:19:13,567 --> 00:19:14,133
Which one?

388
00:19:14,233 --> 00:19:15,200
I'll tell you.

389
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:19,100
After Arnold gets off of-
Aaaah!

390
00:19:19,633 --> 00:19:20,967
Right, listen carefully.

391
00:19:21,433 --> 00:19:24,467
Miss Frizzle is on the
farthest planet from the Sun.

392
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,266
Pluto.

393
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,767
To Pluto!

394
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:36,066
Pluto is cold and dark all right!

395
00:19:36,233 --> 00:19:39,000
And clear, they've got to be here.

396
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:48,734
Look!

397
00:19:49,066 --> 00:19:50,333
There they are!

398
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,734
Yay!

399
00:19:55,967 --> 00:19:57,200
Good work, class.

400
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,133
I knew you find us!

401
00:19:59,367 --> 00:20:00,400
Right, Liz?

402
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:02,800
Sure can see the stars from here.

403
00:20:03,066 --> 00:20:04,934
I wonder where the Sun is.

404
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,033
See that tiny star over there?

405
00:20:07,033 --> 00:20:07,567
Uh-huh.

406
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,033
Well, that's it.

407
00:20:09,133 --> 00:20:10,500
That's the Sun?!

408
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,467
Mmm-hmm!

409
00:20:11,567 --> 00:20:13,300
No wonder Pluto's so cold and dark!

410
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,066
Look how far away the Sun is!

411
00:20:15,367 --> 00:20:19,900
So, the colder we got, the
warmer we got finding you.

412
00:20:20,033 --> 00:20:23,400
It was a good hint if I do say so myself.

413
00:20:30,967 --> 00:20:35,633
I got enough stuff for all of
us to prove we made it to Pluto.

414
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:36,734
Huh?

415
00:20:37,133 --> 00:20:39,000
Well, what are you waiting for?

416
00:20:39,066 --> 00:20:39,767
Let's go!

417
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,400
Are you kidding?

418
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,000
There's no room in there.

419
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,000
All right, be that way.

420
00:20:53,934 --> 00:20:56,800
There's no way I'm going
home without my stuff!

421
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,633
There's no way I'm going home without <i>you</i>.

422
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,800
It's proof!

423
00:21:01,033 --> 00:21:03,233
Nobody will believe me without it.

424
00:21:03,467 --> 00:21:04,633
I'll believe you.

425
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,367
They'll believe you.

426
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,633
Janet, you want proof?

427
00:21:10,667 --> 00:21:11,900
I'll give you proof.

428
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:16,000
Here's proof of what will happen to you
if you stay here with your stuff.

429
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,233
Arnold, no!

430
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:22,700
Oh, cuz'!

431
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:24,867
Back to Earth!

432
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,000
And step on it!

433
00:21:38,967 --> 00:21:40,400
Ah, ah, choo!

434
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,834
Thanks, Janet.

435
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,800
Arnold, it's the least I can do.

436
00:21:45,133 --> 00:21:48,133
If it weren't for you, I'd still
be on Pluto with all my stuff.

437
00:21:48,967 --> 00:21:50,600
I don't need to prove anything.

438
00:21:50,633 --> 00:21:53,100
That was the most amazing field trip ever!

439
00:21:53,433 --> 00:21:55,166
You know it, I know it.

440
00:21:55,567 --> 00:21:58,633
If no one else believes
me, that's their problem.

441
00:21:58,967 --> 00:22:01,033
Right on! Way to go, Janet!

442
00:22:01,033 --> 00:22:01,767
You said it.

443
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,066
Ahchoo!

444
00:22:05,467 --> 00:22:06,867
Attention all students!

445
00:22:06,967 --> 00:22:11,567
We've just learned that scientists have made their
first contact with an alien from outer space.

446
00:22:11,633 --> 00:22:12,667
An alien?

447
00:22:12,667 --> 00:22:13,667
Wow.

448
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,100
Ralphie was right!

449
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:16,333
Oh my.

450
00:22:16,967 --> 00:22:21,567
The alien, claiming to be from Pluto, has
called to complain about a pile of litter

451
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:23,800
That was recently dumped on his planet.

452
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,500
Ralphie!

453
00:22:26,667 --> 00:22:31,066
As I always say, class,
you're out of this world.

454
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,567


455
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,400


456
00:22:42,533 --> 00:22:43,734
Is this the Magic School Bus?

457
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,133
Is this the Magic School Bus?

458
00:22:45,133 --> 00:22:46,867
Magic School Bus?
Magic School Bus?

459
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:49,500
 Magic School Bus?

460
00:22:49,567 --> 00:22:50,533
Magic School Bus?

461
00:22:50,633 --> 00:22:52,000
Magic School Bus?

462
00:22:52,433 --> 00:22:54,000
I want the Magic School Bus!

463
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:56,367
I want the Magic School Bus!

464
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:12,600


465
00:23:12,667 --> 00:23:14,433
Hello, Magic School Bus.

466
00:23:14,533 --> 00:23:16,200
Don't you mean The Twilight Zone?

467
00:23:16,367 --> 00:23:18,567
That show had more
science fiction than fact!

468
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,934
Well, we realize a school bus
would make a lousy spacecraft.

469
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,800
I'll give you that one, but only because
you'll call it a <i>magic</i> school bus.

470
00:23:27,166 --> 00:23:30,567
But there's no way any spacecraft
could visit all nine planets in a day.

471
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:34,600
Well, if we did it in real time, you would
be a grown up by the time we got to Pluto.

472
00:23:35,066 --> 00:23:38,333
Speaking of Pluto, scientists don't
really know what its surface is like.

473
00:23:38,533 --> 00:23:43,266
You're right, but until one of your kids
grows up to be an astronomer or an astronaut

474
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,333
And figures out what Pluto
is like, we have to guess.

475
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,633
Also, Pluto right now isn't
the ninth planet from the Sun.

476
00:23:49,667 --> 00:23:53,333
Until 1999, it's temporarily
inside Neptune's orbit.

477
00:23:53,567 --> 00:23:54,700
Right again.

478
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:57,767
What about those funny looking sun goggles?

479
00:23:57,934 --> 00:24:00,433
I happen to know you should
never look directly at the Sun.

480
00:24:00,734 --> 00:24:01,600
Hurts your eyes.

481
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,333
You're one bright kid.

482
00:24:04,367 --> 00:24:07,433
So how come some of the time the
kids were floating around in the bus?

483
00:24:07,734 --> 00:24:13,033
Well, when the bus was coasting with the rocket
engines off, they were weightless, like astronauts.

484
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,900
Oh yeah, so how come they were
able to walk around in the bus sometime?

485
00:24:18,066 --> 00:24:22,800
Well, uh, would you believe an artificial
gravity geoscopic infabulator?

486
00:24:22,834 --> 00:24:25,066
 No way.

487
00:24:25,133 --> 00:24:26,934
Okay, you got me. We just fudged it.

488
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,667
And I don't think I didn't notice that you had
all the planets lined up in a neat little row.

489
00:24:31,066 --> 00:24:31,900
Oh, that.

490
00:24:32,266 --> 00:24:37,166
Well, it's true that planets are
very rarely all lined up like that.

491
00:24:37,367 --> 00:24:38,867
Yeah, like almost never.

492
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,100
But it's so much easier to keep
track of them all that way!

493
00:24:42,133 --> 00:24:44,200
You wouldn't want us to have
forgotten one, would you?

494
00:24:44,266 --> 00:24:45,100
And another thing,

495
00:24:45,433 --> 00:24:49,467
If an astronaut ever does make to Pluto,
she'd better not take her helmet off.

496
00:24:49,834 --> 00:24:52,166
You think they'd end up
with more than a cold, huh?

497
00:24:52,233 --> 00:24:54,367
She'd end up a block of ice or worse, 

498
00:24:54,533 --> 00:24:56,400
Which reminds me why I called in the first place.

499
00:24:56,533 --> 00:24:57,300
Yes?

500
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,900
I'm still waiting for someone to
get that pile of litter off my planet.
