39
00:01:28,567 --> 00:01:30,367
Wanda, I can't move.

40
00:01:31,467 --> 00:01:32,200
Push!

41
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,533
Whoa!

42
00:01:38,133 --> 00:01:41,000
Whoa!

43
00:01:41,867 --> 00:01:42,600
Oof!

44
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,333
Yes!

45
00:01:44,467 --> 00:01:45,500
How's it goin', Liz?

46
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,033
Aren't you psyched?

47
00:01:48,266 --> 00:01:50,367
The Frizz is taking us to the beach today.

48
00:01:50,433 --> 00:01:51,233
Don't forget!

49
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,900
We can't go until after our reports.

50
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:56,633
Then let's keep the reports short, D. A.

51
00:01:56,767 --> 00:01:59,367
Yup, where there's a will, there's a way!

52
00:01:59,433 --> 00:02:00,667


53
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:05,333
We brought sand and a crab shell for
our two beach things to go together report.

54
00:02:05,734 --> 00:02:06,867
Didn't we, Carlos?

55
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,166
Whoa! A humongous wave at ten o' clock!

56
00:02:10,533 --> 00:02:11,166
See?

57
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,834
Crabs dig in the sand.

58
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,600
So crabs and sand go together.

59
00:02:15,867 --> 00:02:17,533


60
00:02:17,567 --> 00:02:19,033
Wipeoutl!

61
00:02:19,867 --> 00:02:21,233


62
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,000
What did you bring, Ralphie?

63
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,333


64
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,166
Uh…

65
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,500
Hello, everyone.

66
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,734
Hi, you guys.

67
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:32,300
Phoebe, Phoebe, did
you bring the dune grass?

68
00:02:32,533 --> 00:02:35,100
Ralphie, have I ever let you down?

69
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,834
Did you bring the sun?

70
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Actually, I couldn't fit it in my
knapsack, but I did bring this.

71
00:02:41,367 --> 00:02:42,100


72
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:44,000


73
00:02:44,133 --> 00:02:46,200
The sun, in all its glory.

74
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,433
At my old school, we weren't
allowed to bring the sun to class.

75
00:02:50,734 --> 00:02:51,400


76
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,266
How about you, Tim?

77
00:02:53,367 --> 00:02:54,033
Check it out.

78
00:02:54,266 --> 00:02:57,000
A stunning portrait of a rock
to go with Wanda's mussel.

79
00:02:57,233 --> 00:02:59,533
You did bring the
mussel, didn't you, Wanda?

80
00:03:01,433 --> 00:03:02,100
Ta-da!

81
00:03:02,967 --> 00:03:04,800
One mussel to go with Tim's rock.

82
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,867
I named him Gussel the Mussel.

83
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:07,867
Gus for short.

84
00:03:08,533 --> 00:03:09,667
Who's Gus for short?

85
00:03:10,133 --> 00:03:11,000
Hi, Keisha.

86
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,734
Gus is the mussel I brought for the
two beach things that go together report.

87
00:03:15,033 --> 00:03:16,667
See?

88
00:03:16,734 --> 00:03:17,533
Oh, no.

89
00:03:17,767 --> 00:03:19,066
Oh, help. Oh, bad.

90
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,166
Oh, bad, bad.

91
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:22,700
Oh, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.

92
00:03:23,066 --> 00:03:23,967
Something wrong?

93
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,900
I totally forgot about the report.

94
00:03:27,233 --> 00:03:28,000
You did?

95
00:03:28,467 --> 00:03:30,500
You didn't bring anything?

96
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:32,867
Just my swimsuit and a towel.

97
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,000
And a tuna fish sandwich.

98
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,166
Uh-oh.

99
00:03:38,433 --> 00:03:39,467
What's wrong with that?

100
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,734
I love tuna sandwiches.

101
00:03:42,066 --> 00:03:43,767
Listen, don't panic yet.

102
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:45,300
Who's your partner?

103
00:03:45,533 --> 00:03:46,266
Arnold.

104
00:03:46,633 --> 00:03:47,600
Don't worry.

105
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,033
Arnold likes reports.

106
00:03:49,133 --> 00:03:50,967
He probably did the whole thing himself.

107
00:03:51,266 --> 00:03:52,700
Where is Arnold anyway?

108
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,200


109
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,300
Arnold?

110
00:03:59,367 --> 00:04:00,200
Hi, guys.

111
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,567
Yuck!

112
00:04:01,667 --> 00:04:03,433
What happened to your shoe?

113
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,500
I was running.

114
00:04:05,066 --> 00:04:07,867
And I sort of stepped into
the pond near our house.

115
00:04:08,233 --> 00:04:10,233
And you were running
because you were in a hurry

116
00:04:10,233 --> 00:04:12,433
Because you couldn't wait
to show me what you did

117
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,300
For our two beach things
that go together report, right?

118
00:04:16,467 --> 00:04:17,400
Ugh!

119
00:04:17,967 --> 00:04:20,533
I knew I forgot something!

120
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,166
You mean you didn't bring anything either?

121
00:04:24,834 --> 00:04:26,633
Just my bathing suit and a towel.

122
00:04:28,367 --> 00:04:29,934
And the scum on your shoe!

123
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,533


124
00:04:31,533 --> 00:04:33,734
Scum and a tuna fish sandwich.

125
00:04:33,867 --> 00:04:35,667
D. A., why didn't we think of that?

126
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,100
But do scum and a tuna
fish sandwich go together?

127
00:04:39,467 --> 00:04:41,934
Hey, maybe they do.

128
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,000
Think, think, think, think, think, think.

129
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:46,734
No.

130
00:04:47,133 --> 00:04:48,166
Oh great.

131
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:51,100
Not only do I get slimed by pond scum,

132
00:04:51,266 --> 00:04:52,934
But I forget my report!

133
00:04:53,667 --> 00:04:56,266
I knew I should have stayed home today.

134
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,600
Hey!

135
00:04:58,934 --> 00:05:00,600
We can't just give up, Arnold.

136
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:02,834
We have to work with what we got.

137
00:05:03,533 --> 00:05:04,600
But Keisha!

138
00:05:05,233 --> 00:05:07,333
Oh, good morning, class!

139
00:05:07,633 --> 00:05:09,467
Good morning, Miss Frizzle!

140
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:12,133
We have an exciting day ahead of us.

141
00:05:13,033 --> 00:05:13,867
Haven't we?

142
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,533
Hang 10, you guys!

143
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,800
Maybe she'll forget the reports.

144
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:23,400
And the first thing on the agenda is your
two beach things that go together reports.

145
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,934
Then again, maybe she won't.

146
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,500
Hmm, let's start with, um, Ralphie and Phoebe.

147
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,567
Phew.

148
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,400
Why the sun and dune grass go together!

149
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,333
By us!

150
00:05:36,667 --> 00:05:37,333
All rights reserved.

151
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,500
Dune grass, like other plants, 

152
00:05:41,767 --> 00:05:44,433
Uses the energy from the sun
to make its own food.

153
00:05:44,567 --> 00:05:46,867
No sun? No dune grass.

154
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,166
No sun? No nothing!

155
00:05:57,533 --> 00:06:00,834
Oh, Keisha and Arnold,
why don't you go next?

156
00:06:02,934 --> 00:06:05,100
Yes, well, uh...

157
00:06:05,433 --> 00:06:09,066
We brought this, um, nutritious
tuna fish sandwich.

158
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:13,233
And this delightful green scum.

159
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,533
You did?

160
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,967
Why that is absolutely fantastic!

161
00:06:18,233 --> 00:06:19,767
It is?!

162
00:06:21,233 --> 00:06:25,633
So tell us what the connection
is between delightful green scum

163
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,100
And a nutritious tuna fish sandwich.

164
00:06:28,433 --> 00:06:34,567
Um, uh, they both
have... um... adjectives?

165
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,200
Oh dear, hold that thought.

166
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:43,000
It's time to go to the beach.

167
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,700
Oh, but don't worry. We'll finish
your reports when we get back.

168
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,367
Line up by the door please.

169
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:50,500
Saved by the bell.

170
00:06:50,934 --> 00:06:55,033
Yeah, I never thought I'd
be<i> glad</i> to go on a field trip.

171
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:16,133


172
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,600
Oh, for once, a nice
peaceful day at the beach.

173
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,200
Forget it, Arnold.

174
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:26,300
Everyone else will have a wonderful
time, but we've got work to do.

175
00:07:26,567 --> 00:07:27,800
Now concentrate.

176
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:31,633
How does your scum go with my sandwich?

177
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,700


178
00:07:32,767 --> 00:07:36,500
You know class, this trip just might
give you the answer you're looking for.

179
00:07:36,734 --> 00:07:39,000
I wonder if she knows we don't know.

180
00:07:39,233 --> 00:07:41,000
She knows everything.

181
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,333
Frizzle: Well, not exactly everything.

182
00:07:43,967 --> 00:07:47,567
It's your job as scientists
to look for connections.

183
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,667
Connections?

184
00:07:49,066 --> 00:07:50,867
You mean how things go together?

185
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,567
 Exactly.

186
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:59,567


187
00:08:00,433 --> 00:08:02,767
We're here, everybody out.

188
00:08:05,367 --> 00:08:09,000
There's dune grass with
the sun beaming down on it.

189
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,133
And here's a rock.

190
00:08:14,367 --> 00:08:15,867
Covered with Gus' family!

191
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,433
Look at them all!

192
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,233
It's a regular... mussel beach.

193
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:21,000


194
00:08:21,266 --> 00:08:22,467
Carlos!

195
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,834
And here's a crab burrowing into the sand.

196
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:28,367
Look up there.

197
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,000
That's a gull, isn't it?

198
00:08:31,133 --> 00:08:32,600
I wonder what it's doing.

199
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,600
Wow!

200
00:08:37,633 --> 00:08:39,300
It just ate that crab!

201
00:08:47,233 --> 00:08:50,100
Um, the beach air is making me hungry.

202
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,066
Hmm.

203
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,367
Everyone else's reports seem so obvious.

204
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:55,533


205
00:08:58,266 --> 00:09:00,367
Arnold, you're eating our report!

206
00:09:00,867 --> 00:09:02,133
Oh, sorry.

207
00:09:02,533 --> 00:09:03,200
I forgot.

208
00:09:03,734 --> 00:09:08,834
Arnold, we've got to figure out the connection
between my sandwich and your scum.

209
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,533
Ready to explore this environment?

210
00:09:13,767 --> 00:09:14,934
In a bit more depth?

211
00:09:15,467 --> 00:09:16,000
Huh?

212
00:09:16,133 --> 00:09:16,800
Now?

213
00:09:17,033 --> 00:09:18,066
But we just got here.

214
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:19,166
Uh-oh.

215
00:09:19,533 --> 00:09:22,300
I'm getting that old
field trip feeling again.

216
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,834
Come on, Arnold.

217
00:09:24,133 --> 00:09:26,700
I know we can figure it out if we try.

218
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,700
Seat belts, everyone!

219
00:09:31,767 --> 00:09:34,533
H2O , here we go!

220
00:09:34,567 --> 00:09:36,033


221
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,900
Mmm, how refreshing!

222
00:09:49,233 --> 00:09:52,233
♪ Anchors away, my class, ♪ 

223
00:09:52,367 --> 00:09:55,066
♪ Anchors away! ♪

224
00:09:55,166 --> 00:10:01,333


225
00:10:02,233 --> 00:10:03,533
Think, Arnold, think!

226
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,834
I can't!

227
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,033
I hate it when my socks get wet.

228
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,700
Can I have my shoe back?

229
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
No way.

230
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:12,000
We need it for our report.

231
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,867
Ooh, look!

232
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:15,600
There's some seaweed!

233
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,934
What are those?

234
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:19,600
They're beautiful.

235
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,767
Those are sea urchins, Tim.

236
00:10:21,834 --> 00:10:22,900
They eat seaweed.

237
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,500
And sea otters eat them!

238
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,800
Do you really
think they... Otter?

239
00:10:29,934 --> 00:10:31,000
Bad Carlos.

240
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:33,633
Hmm.

241
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:35,000
Are you looking, Arnold?

242
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,567
What do you see down there?

243
00:10:36,734 --> 00:10:39,433
Well, I'm trying hard
to look for connections.

244
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,033
Just as you said, but I can't
see past all that... Green stuff.

245
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,467
Yuck, it's going all scummy.

246
00:10:46,734 --> 00:10:48,300
Did you say scummy?

247
00:10:48,567 --> 00:10:49,400
That's it!

248
00:10:49,533 --> 00:10:51,467
Look, Keisha, scum!

249
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,700
Excellent observation, Arnold.

250
00:10:56,367 --> 00:10:58,600
This scum is called phytoplankton.

251
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,633
Phytoplankton?

252
00:11:00,834 --> 00:11:02,467
Phytoplankton!

253
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,633
Phytoplankton!

254
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,200
Yes, little tiny plants.

255
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,000
Wait a second.

256
00:11:09,467 --> 00:11:14,967
Does that mean the scum on Arnold's
shoe is some kind of phytoplankton?

257
00:11:15,233 --> 00:11:19,066
Ah! Care to try my marvelous
mega magnifier, mayhaps?

258
00:11:21,133 --> 00:11:22,266
Sea scum.

259
00:11:24,533 --> 00:11:25,900
Shoe scum.

260
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,166
Not exactly the same, but not far off.

261
00:11:32,633 --> 00:11:34,000
What do you think, Keisha?

262
00:11:34,367 --> 00:11:36,133
Should we take a closer look?

263
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,767
Sure. Why not?

264
00:11:37,967 --> 00:11:40,100
Keisha, you don't
know what you're saying.

265
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,467
I know that tone of voice.

266
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:43,700
It means something
weird is going to happen.

267
00:11:44,367 --> 00:11:46,000
Wahoo!

268
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,133
Uh, did we just shrink?

269
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,400
We did.

270
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,867
We are now as tiny as phytoplankton.

271
00:12:02,233 --> 00:12:04,000
And that's seriously tiny.

272
00:12:04,367 --> 00:12:07,000
Class, you will notice that
the buses equipping each of us

273
00:12:07,266 --> 00:12:10,000
With a specially designed
underwater breathing mask.

274
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,700
So, get messy!

275
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,166
Make mistakes!

276
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,000
Get out there and explore!

277
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,633
Wanda: I'll go first.

278
00:12:20,967 --> 00:12:22,834
This is so cool!

279
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:24,867
Arnold: And so wet.

280
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:26,633
Wow.

281
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:30,266
And remember, look for connections.

282
00:12:30,367 --> 00:12:31,033
Got it.

283
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:44,867


284
00:12:45,133 --> 00:12:46,300
I don't get it.

285
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,400
How are we supposed
to find a tuna fish sandwich,

286
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:53,266
In the middle of the ocean when
we're the size of phytoplankton?

287
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:54,000
Who knows?

288
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:57,900
Maybe there's teeny, tiny
phytoplankton-operated sandwich stands.

289
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:01,667
And to think that when we're big,
all this just looks like green scum.

290
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,333
Amazing, isn't it?

291
00:13:04,834 --> 00:13:07,333
Arnold, what are you doing?

292
00:13:07,533 --> 00:13:08,767
Who, me?

293
00:13:08,867 --> 00:13:09,867
Arnold.

294
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:14,266
We have to figure out what all this
has got to do with my tuna fish sandwich.

295
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:16,667
And we have to figure it out now.

296
00:13:16,734 --> 00:13:17,900
Hey, Keisha!

297
00:13:18,066 --> 00:13:19,867
Look at me!

298
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,533


299
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,934
Is it my imagination
or do they look hungry?

300
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:30,000


301
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:33,934
It's not just you, Ralphie.

302
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:37,033
These bigger creatures
<i>are</i> eating the phytoplankton.

303
00:13:37,266 --> 00:13:41,000
So, as I always say, it's
better to be in the bus...

304
00:13:42,734 --> 00:13:44,333
Whoa!

305
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,200
Than to be in something else.

306
00:13:49,567 --> 00:13:52,767
Ah, nature never ceases to amaze me.

307
00:13:52,867 --> 00:13:55,300


308
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,834
Phew, we were nearly lunch at first sight.

309
00:14:00,033 --> 00:14:02,600
Just your average day
at the beach with the Frizz.

310
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,300
Okay, bus.

311
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,066
Do your stuff!

312
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,467
Congratulations!

313
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,967
We are now the size of zooplankton.

314
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,367
Zooplankton?

315
00:14:15,767 --> 00:14:18,233
I wonder if that's what
just tried to eat us.

316
00:14:18,734 --> 00:14:20,200
Very good, Keisha.

317
00:14:20,433 --> 00:14:22,367
Zooplankton eat phytoplankton.

318
00:14:22,867 --> 00:14:25,667
Zooplankton are tiny
animals that live in the water.

319
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:29,233
This way, class, we've got to take chances.

320
00:14:29,367 --> 00:14:30,367
Get messy!

321
00:14:30,467 --> 00:14:31,500
Get eaten.

322
00:14:31,967 --> 00:14:35,033
And don't forget to look for connections.

323
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,800
But Miss Frizzle, this is a big ocean.

324
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,700
I'll never find a connection between
scum and a tuna fish sandwich.

325
00:14:42,934 --> 00:14:45,100
Of course you will, Keisha.

326
00:14:45,433 --> 00:14:46,800
Stay with your partner.

327
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:47,600
But,

328
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:48,867
Mmm.

329
00:14:49,233 --> 00:14:52,567
Hey, Keisha, we thought
phytoplankton looked weird,

330
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,333
Get a load of these guys!

331
00:14:54,667 --> 00:14:56,800
They are not guys, Carlos.

332
00:14:57,033 --> 00:14:58,233
They're zooplankton.

333
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,800
There don't seem to be as many of
them as there were of the phytoplankton.

334
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:03,700
Good observation, Tim.

335
00:15:03,934 --> 00:15:05,100
What else do you notice?

336
00:15:05,266 --> 00:15:05,867
Anyone?

337
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,300
Those giant things.

338
00:15:09,767 --> 00:15:11,066
Very good, Phoebe.

339
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,667
Those giant things are anchovies.

340
00:15:15,033 --> 00:15:16,400
They're a kind of fish.

341
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,400
Anchovies?

342
00:15:18,467 --> 00:15:22,467
You mean the salty things my dad puts on
his pizza when he doesn't want me to eat it?

343
00:15:23,767 --> 00:15:27,233
You may not like anchovies,
Ralphie, but they might like you.

344
00:15:27,266 --> 00:15:30,133
I wonder if that's because
we're the size of zooplankton.

345
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,900
Keisha's right, class.

346
00:15:33,834 --> 00:15:36,467
As you can see, anchovies eat zooplankton.

347
00:15:39,667 --> 00:15:42,000
Can anyone guess where this is leading?

348
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:42,900
To lunch?

349
00:15:42,967 --> 00:15:43,834
Precisely.

350
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,066
All right, everyone.

351
00:15:45,266 --> 00:15:46,200
Back in the bus.

352
00:15:46,467 --> 00:15:49,033


353
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,433
Ready, bus?

354
00:15:52,066 --> 00:15:53,700
Wee!

355
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,734
Well done.

356
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,367
We are now the size of an anchovy.

357
00:15:57,734 --> 00:16:00,667
I suggest we stay in the
bus while we have our lunch.

358
00:16:00,934 --> 00:16:03,433
But there's so much to see out there!

359
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,900
Oh, excellent observation, Wanda.

360
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,367
At my old school, we always had to stay
in the bus if we ate lunch in the ocean.

361
00:16:12,533 --> 00:16:16,533
Since we can't eat our report, do
you want some organic potato chips?

362
00:16:16,867 --> 00:16:17,700
No, thanks.

363
00:16:17,767 --> 00:16:19,667
I had some phytoplankton earlier.

364
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,767
You did?

365
00:16:21,467 --> 00:16:23,867
Listen, Arnold. Time is running out.

366
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,867
And we don't have our report yet.

367
00:16:26,066 --> 00:16:26,667
Scum.

368
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,800
Tuna fish sandwich.

369
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,400
Scum.

370
00:16:28,433 --> 00:16:29,567
Tuna fish sandwich.

371
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,800
What's in a tuna fish sandwich anyway?

372
00:16:32,066 --> 00:16:34,100
Mayonnaise, tuna fish.

373
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,900
Maybe a little vinegar,
some chopped celery.

374
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:40,133
Did you say tuna <i>fish</i>?

375
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,533
Um, yeah.

376
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:44,633
Arnold, you may accidentally be a genius.

377
00:16:45,066 --> 00:16:46,767
What does a tuna fish look like?

378
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,734
I don't know.

379
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,734
I never saw one without mayonnaise.

380
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,500
D.A., quick.

381
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,600
There's got to be a picture of a
tuna fish in one of your books.

382
00:16:57,133 --> 00:16:59,066
Here, an albacore tuna.

383
00:17:03,767 --> 00:17:06,000
I got it. I got the connection!

384
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,467
What eats phytoplankton? Zooplankton!

385
00:17:10,567 --> 00:17:13,767
And what eats zooplankton?
Little fish like anchovies!

386
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,834
And what eats little fish like anchovies?

387
00:17:17,934 --> 00:17:18,533
Well?

388
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,367
Tuna fish!

389
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:25,367
AAAAAAAAAAAAH!

390
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:39,166
Arnold: I knew I should’ve stayed home today.

391
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:43,367
Class, we are now inside an albacore tuna.

392
00:17:44,867 --> 00:17:45,934
Cheer up, Arnold. 

393
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,433
We’re off the hook.

394
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,633
We know how your scum and
my tuna fish sandwich are connected!

395
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,533
Ugh, you know,

396
00:17:53,767 --> 00:17:56,600
It’s a tuna-eat-scum world out there.

397
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,500
No, no, no, listen!

398
00:17:58,734 --> 00:17:59,934
Tuna don’t eat scum.

399
00:18:00,266 --> 00:18:05,900
Scum gets eaten by zooplankton, which get eaten
by little fish like anchovies, which get eaten by tuna!

400
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,000
Our report’s in the bag!

401
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:11,166
The bag’s in a tuna’s tummy.

402
00:18:11,767 --> 00:18:14,600
Who knows what you call
something that’s connected? 

403
00:18:14,934 --> 00:18:16,033
Linked together.

404
00:18:16,734 --> 00:18:18,166
You mean like a chain?

405
00:18:18,767 --> 00:18:20,800
Oh! Very good, Tim!

406
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,233
Tuna are linked to phytoplankton
by what they eat.

407
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,467
Tuna and phytoplankton belong
to the same food chain!

408
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,834
Food chain? 

409
00:18:30,066 --> 00:18:33,200
A chain of food? I could get into that!

410
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:34,066
Me too!

411
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,166
Phytoplankton, zooplankton, fish, and people too!

412
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:39,233
We’re all in a food chain.

413
00:18:39,433 --> 00:18:41,033
Scum, this fish, and you!

414
00:18:42,367 --> 00:18:45,400
Humans are usually at the
very top of the food chain.

415
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:49,066
But for once, we’re actually inside it!

416
00:18:49,867 --> 00:18:50,567
Hmm,

417
00:18:51,233 --> 00:18:56,100
We are also in the perfect position
to study a tuna’s digestive system.

418
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:58,033
What? 

419
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:58,900
Now?

420
00:18:59,066 --> 00:19:02,033
Miss Frizzle, do you think we
can go back to school now?

421
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,066
Arnold and I need to do our report!

422
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,400
Well, if you insist.

423
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,934
I guess we could leave the tuna’s
digestive system for another day.

424
00:19:10,467 --> 00:19:12,100
Whoo, way to go!

425
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:13,200
Close one.

426
00:19:23,934 --> 00:19:24,734
Hmm.

427
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,767
Yes, very good!

428
00:19:32,233 --> 00:19:34,567
Okay class, take your seats!

429
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,700
Here we go!

430
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,967
Class: Help!

431
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:45,000
Yow!

432
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:49,500
Nope.

433
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,533
Already have a bus.

434
00:19:52,867 --> 00:19:53,700
Look out!

435
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:04,333
Look out! Whoa!

436
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,633
This is it, Ralphie.

437
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,800
The wave of our dreams!

438
00:20:08,066 --> 00:20:11,900
When we get back to the classroom,
we will discuss our observations!

439
00:20:12,033 --> 00:20:13,033
Surf’s up!

440
00:20:14,133 --> 00:20:17,000
Arnold, do you observe what I observe?

441
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:19,000
She’s hanging 10!

442
00:20:19,367 --> 00:20:22,400
There really is more to Ms.
Frizzle than meets the eye!

443
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,900
So to wrap up our report, allow us to show
you the artwork we’ve commissioned.

444
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,600
An original tale.

445
00:20:35,266 --> 00:20:37,300
Here we have our recent experience. 

446
00:20:37,433 --> 00:20:38,734
The ocean food chain. 

447
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,100
It works like this: 

448
00:20:40,367 --> 00:20:43,133
Scum, or phytoplankton, are eaten by zooplankton,

449
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:45,633
Which are eaten by small fish like anchovies,

450
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,500
Which are eaten by big fish, like tuna!

451
00:20:49,033 --> 00:20:50,967
It’s so e-fish-cient!

452
00:20:51,233 --> 00:20:52,333
Carlos!

453
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,000
And this, class, is a land food chain.

454
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,667
Yeah, a mouse eats grass seeds, 

455
00:20:58,834 --> 00:21:00,433
A snake eats the mouse, 

456
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,100
And the hawk eats the snake!

457
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,734
The hawk is at the top of this food chain.

458
00:21:09,066 --> 00:21:10,667
What’s at the bottom? Hmm?

459
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,333
Grass!

460
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,400
So, what’s at the bottom of the ocean food chain?

461
00:21:17,967 --> 00:21:18,700
I think,

462
00:21:19,033 --> 00:21:20,200
Phytoplankton!

463
00:21:20,467 --> 00:21:23,300
And what do phytoplankton and
grass have in common?

464
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,000
You step on them both.

465
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:26,367
Arnold!

466
00:21:27,033 --> 00:21:28,633
They’re both plants!

467
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,967
Hey wait a minute.

468
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,867
Do food chains begin with plants?

469
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,033
Yes, they do!

470
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,000
Each and every one of them!

471
00:21:37,133 --> 00:21:39,934
Yay!

472
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:44,100
Well, if scum and a tuna fish
sandwich are connected, 

473
00:21:44,467 --> 00:21:47,934
I guess just about everything
must be connected somehow, huh?

474
00:21:48,633 --> 00:21:50,667
Hey, where’s my shoe?

475
00:22:21,767 --> 00:22:24,166
Nature never ceases to amaze me.

476
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,367
As I always say, if the shoe is clean,

477
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,467
Wear it. 

478
00:22:30,033 --> 00:22:33,600


479
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,567


480
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,400


481
00:22:42,533 --> 00:22:43,734
Is this the Magic School Bus?

482
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,133
Is this the Magic School Bus?

483
00:22:45,133 --> 00:22:46,867
Magic School Bus?
Magic School Bus?

484
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:49,500
 Magic School Bus?

485
00:22:49,567 --> 00:22:50,533
Magic School Bus?

486
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,000
Magic School Bus?

487
00:22:52,433 --> 00:22:54,000
I want the Magic School Bus!

488
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:56,367
I want the Magic School Bus!

489
00:22:57,633 --> 00:23:06,333


490
00:23:07,834 --> 00:23:08,500
Hello.

491
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,700
Hi, is this Big Al’s Total Pigout Emporium?

492
00:23:12,033 --> 00:23:14,600
I’d like to order a toasted Big Al special with-

493
00:23:14,734 --> 00:23:18,900
Whoa, wait a second, wrong number,
this is the Magic School Bus show.

494
00:23:19,367 --> 00:23:21,967
No way! I was just watching it!

495
00:23:22,266 --> 00:23:23,867
That’s why I was so hungry!

496
00:23:24,133 --> 00:23:25,900
Maybe you can clear up a few things for me. 

497
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:27,066
I’ll try.

498
00:23:27,433 --> 00:23:29,433
People are on top of the food chain, right?

499
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,900
Except I don’t eat just tuna,
I eat lots of things!

500
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:35,166
So am I on top of lots of food chains?

501
00:23:35,367 --> 00:23:35,967
You are.

502
00:23:36,767 --> 00:23:39,266
What do you call a lot of chains put together?

503
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,233
A pile?

504
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,667
Am I at the top of the food pile?

505
00:23:42,934 --> 00:23:47,266
Actually a lot of different chains mixed
together are called a food web.

506
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,800
I get it!

507
00:23:49,066 --> 00:23:51,233
So if things are connected in a chain,

508
00:23:51,467 --> 00:23:54,033
What if something happens to
one part of the chain?

509
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:56,700
Well, it will make something happen
to everything else in the chain. 

510
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,233
It’s all connected.

511
00:23:58,567 --> 00:24:02,600
OK, but you know, it’s not true that
all the food chains start with plants.

512
00:24:02,867 --> 00:24:07,567
I read about some plants and animals living deep
in the ocean that get their energy from chemicals.

513
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,300
Yes, but,

514
00:24:09,734 --> 00:24:10,633
They’re weird.

515
00:24:10,834 --> 00:24:13,433
Weird?! You say they’re weird, 

516
00:24:13,533 --> 00:24:15,533
Since when does a tuna eat a school bus?

517
00:24:16,367 --> 00:24:20,567
They could if the bus was small enough
and looked like a delicious anchovy

518
00:24:20,867 --> 00:24:23,934
Yes, but you and I both know
school buses don’t shrink.

519
00:24:24,133 --> 00:24:25,433
And they don’t go in the ocean.

520
00:24:25,667 --> 00:24:28,033
Magic school buses do.

521
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:30,133
Being magic can make all the difference.

522
00:24:30,433 --> 00:24:32,967
And Miss Frizzle must be magic.

523
00:24:33,967 --> 00:24:35,233
Why do you say that?

524
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:38,800
'Cause somehow she can hang 10 between
math lessons and report marking!

525
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,467
 I guess you’re right.

526
00:24:41,867 --> 00:24:43,700
Uh, thanks for calling, bye.

527
00:24:51,266 --> 00:24:53,700
Why, thank you Liz, this looks de-

528
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,300
