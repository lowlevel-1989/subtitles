1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:00:29,816 --> 00:00:32,718
<i>They say, if you wanna
tell a story right,</i>

3
00:00:32,798 --> 00:00:35,106
<i>you gotta start
at the beginning.</i>

4
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:40,214
<i>Too far? Fine.</i>

5
00:00:40,763 --> 00:00:43,737
<i>This is me, Harleen Quinzel.</i>

6
00:00:43,818 --> 00:00:46,761
<i>When I was a kid, my dad
traded me for a six-pack of beer.</i>

7
00:00:46,841 --> 00:00:48,617
<i>But however many times
he tried to ditch me...</i>

8
00:00:48,697 --> 00:00:51,308
<i>- Daddy!
- ...I kept coming back.</i>

9
00:00:51,525 --> 00:00:53,705
<i>Eventually,
he found me a new home.</i>

10
00:00:53,785 --> 00:00:57,262
<i>The good sisters of St.
Bernadette's taught me a lot.</i>

11
00:00:58,831 --> 00:01:02,141
<i>But I was never
an establishment kinda gal.</i>

12
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:05,789
<i>All things considered, I did good.
I even went to college.</i>

13
00:01:05,869 --> 00:01:09,730
<i>Got my PhD.
Had my heart broken once or twice.</i>

14
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,784
<i>Finding love, it's not easy.</i>

15
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:15,704
<i>So I threw myself into my work,
became a psychiatrist.</i>

16
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:20,564
<i>That's when I met him.
Mr. J. My Joker.</i>

17
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:24,764
<i>Oh, I fell hard. Like out
of a plane without a parachute,</i>

18
00:01:24,844 --> 00:01:26,860
<i>right in your dumb
fucking face kinda hard.</i>

19
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,779
<i>I lost all sense of who I was.</i>

20
00:01:29,859 --> 00:01:33,845
<i>I only had eyes for Puddin'.
We all know the saying,</i>

21
00:01:33,925 --> 00:01:37,724
<i>"Behind every successful man
"there's a badass broad."</i>

22
00:01:37,804 --> 00:01:40,873
<i>Well, that was me.
I was the brains behind some of</i>

23
00:01:40,953 --> 00:01:44,516
<i>Mr. J's greatest stunts.
Not that he let anyone know it.</i>

24
00:01:44,576 --> 00:01:45,310
Puddin'?

25
00:01:45,431 --> 00:01:49,193
<i>I guess all good things
have to come to an end.</i>

26
00:01:49,888 --> 00:01:50,969
<i>So...</i>

27
00:01:53,634 --> 00:01:55,851
<i>...we broke up.</i>

28
00:01:56,915 --> 00:01:59,743
<i>I handled it real mature.</i>

29
00:01:59,824 --> 00:02:03,227
<i>But Mr. J was
super broke up about it.</i>

30
00:02:05,933 --> 00:02:11,244
<i>I got an amazing new place
that was all mine.</i>

31
00:02:13,815 --> 00:02:15,883
<i>It gave me the space
to really reflect</i>

32
00:02:15,963 --> 00:02:18,271
<i>on the mistakes of my past.</i>

33
00:02:21,905 --> 00:02:25,235
<i>I had to find a new identity.</i>

34
00:02:25,941 --> 00:02:27,615
<i>A new me.</i>

35
00:02:30,903 --> 00:02:34,889
<i>It wasn't easy. But after a while,
I even opened myself up</i>

36
00:02:34,969 --> 00:02:38,247
<i>to the possibility
of new love.</i>

37
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,724
Hi. Hello, nice baby.

38
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:52,354
<i>- Here's the thing about new love...</i>
- I take payment-in-kind.

39
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:55,200
<i>...you have to feed it.</i>

40
00:03:05,663 --> 00:03:07,898
<i>Soon enough,
I was back on my feet.</i>

41
00:03:07,978 --> 00:03:11,849
<i>Ready to move on,
to make new friends.</i>

42
00:03:11,929 --> 00:03:14,821
<i>She means fucking business!</i>

43
00:03:14,901 --> 00:03:15,968
<i>- Oh, here we go!</i>
- Whip me!

44
00:03:16,048 --> 00:03:19,856
<i>She has taken a whip from the
pivot, catapulted to the high side!</i>

45
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:22,027
<i>Oh!</i>

46
00:03:28,986 --> 00:03:31,472
Yeah! Come on!

47
00:03:31,895 --> 00:03:35,465
<i>It was time for Gotham
to meet the new Harley Quinn,</i>

48
00:03:35,951 --> 00:03:37,997
<i>so I really
put myself out there.</i>

49
00:03:38,077 --> 00:03:41,397
Ride that pole
like you ride your man!

50
00:03:46,054 --> 00:03:48,924
God damn it.
Sit the fuck down.

51
00:03:49,004 --> 00:03:51,216
- What?
- I said...

52
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:53,950
Sit your skinny ass down,
you dumb slut.

53
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,031
Okay.

54
00:03:59,076 --> 00:04:01,822
You broke my fucking legs!

55
00:04:01,902 --> 00:04:03,904
Oh, boo-hoo.

56
00:04:07,082 --> 00:04:08,941
What?

57
00:04:09,021 --> 00:04:12,324
It's not a party without
a little drama, am I right?

58
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:14,873
Come on! Turn it up!

59
00:04:14,953 --> 00:04:17,011
Shots on the house.

60
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:21,035
Call me dumb.
I have a PhD, motherfucker.

61
00:04:21,115 --> 00:04:23,445
- Miss Quinn.
- Romy.

62
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:25,998
- That was my driver.
- Oh, whoops.

63
00:04:26,078 --> 00:04:28,021
Well, I'm sure it was his fault.
Consider him fired.

64
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,917
Consider me grateful. Especially
since I know you don't like me.

65
00:04:32,032 --> 00:04:34,912
I agitate his already delicate
sense of mental equilibrium.

66
00:04:34,992 --> 00:04:37,967
That and his obsessive-compulsive
need to be the center of attention.

67
00:04:38,047 --> 00:04:40,449
Will your paramour
be joining us this evening?

68
00:04:40,977 --> 00:04:44,443
Not tonight, Romy.
Not tonight.

69
00:04:44,949 --> 00:04:48,007
Well, enjoy yourself, Miss Quinn.
And do give the Joker my best.

70
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:50,969
<i>Okay, fine, so I hadn't
told people about the breakup.</i>

71
00:04:51,049 --> 00:04:54,044
<i>- But you don't understand.</i>
- Find me a new driver.

72
00:04:54,124 --> 00:04:57,527
<i>Being Joker's girl
gave me immunity.</i>

73
00:04:58,034 --> 00:05:01,905
<i>I could do whatever I wanted
to whoever I wanted,</i>

74
00:05:01,985 --> 00:05:05,325
<i>and no one
ever dared to object.</i>

75
00:05:18,104 --> 00:05:22,393
And don't let him give you shit, okay?
You have to stick up for yourself.

76
00:05:41,187 --> 00:05:44,881
Oh, please. I give it a few days
before they're back together.

77
00:05:44,961 --> 00:05:47,874
<i> Even when I did try and tell
people, they didn't believe me.</i>

78
00:05:47,954 --> 00:05:50,876
Come on. She told me they're
really broken up this time.

79
00:05:50,956 --> 00:05:54,515
Sure they are, Shell. That's why she's
still wearing that tacky "J" necklace.

80
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:59,946
She is going to be running right back into
his arms the minute he snaps his fingers.

81
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:03,033
If not him, the next closest
alpha male with a pulse.

82
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:06,105
Some people just aren't
born to stand on their own.

83
00:06:06,186 --> 00:06:08,038
- Oh, girl, let's drink. Come on.
- All right.

84
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:10,967
<i>I knew I needed to find
some way to show the world</i>

85
00:06:11,047 --> 00:06:14,043
<i>that I'd cut ties with Mr. J
for good.</i>

86
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:16,125
Harley!

87
00:06:18,022 --> 00:06:20,676
<i>Some people have the
Eiffel Tower, or Olive Garden.</i>

88
00:06:20,733 --> 00:06:24,046
<i>The Joker and I?
Our love bloomed in a highly toxic</i>

89
00:06:24,287 --> 00:06:26,676
<i>industrial processing plant.</i>

90
00:06:33,015 --> 00:06:36,536
<i>And luckily for me,
I have all my best ideas drunk.</i>

91
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:39,768
I have the best idea!

92
00:06:48,101 --> 00:06:51,588
The fuck?
Hey! Hey! Come back here!

93
00:07:02,072 --> 00:07:04,463
This is
where it all began, Puddin'.

94
00:07:05,231 --> 00:07:07,581
You motherfucker!

95
00:07:34,226 --> 00:07:36,680
<i>It was the closure I needed.</i>

96
00:07:37,072 --> 00:07:40,589
<i>A fresh start.
A chance to be my own woman.</i>

97
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:57,163
<i>But I wasn't the only dame
in Gotham looking for emancipation.</i>

98
00:07:58,216 --> 00:08:01,473
<i>This is our story.</i>

99
00:08:03,148 --> 00:08:06,499
<i>And I'm telling it,
so I'll start where I fucking want.</i>

100
00:08:08,225 --> 00:08:11,148
<i>- Meet the cop.</i>
- I got 50 says it was turf war.

101
00:08:11,228 --> 00:08:14,108
<i>- Not him.</i>
- Well, as always, you're wrong, Munroe.

102
00:08:14,188 --> 00:08:16,384
<i>Her. Renee Montoya.</i>

103
00:08:16,465 --> 00:08:20,010
<i>Raised on '80s cop shows,
she's always saying cheesy shit like...</i>

104
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:24,117
There was only one shooter.
Inside.

105
00:08:24,197 --> 00:08:27,141
This guy shot out the glass.
Serrano.

106
00:08:27,221 --> 00:08:29,223
Yo. Hey.

107
00:08:30,151 --> 00:08:32,198
Have Ballistics check for a bullet
in one of those parked cars.

108
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:35,210
<i>Ten years ago, she broke
a career-making case.</i>

109
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:37,160
- Did I stutter?
- Go ahead.

110
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,080
<i>But her partner at the time
took all the credit.</i>

111
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,740
So while he made captain, she got stuck
at detective level with this idiot.

112
00:08:44,132 --> 00:08:47,065
- Okay, you think one guy got all four?
- Wait, wait, wait.

113
00:08:47,145 --> 00:08:49,140
I'm just saying, we got four
dead bodies here, you know.

114
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,257
- One guy... Bullet holes.
- I'm trying to work.

115
00:08:51,337 --> 00:08:54,594
I'm sorry.
Go ahead and work. Go ahead.

116
00:08:59,146 --> 00:09:02,130
The shooter got close
before drawing. Six rounds.

117
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:05,164
- Two for each of these three.
- Yo, mind your debt.

118
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:07,771
I'm telling you.
That girl, Angelina, she's a princess.

119
00:09:07,815 --> 00:09:11,246
- Look at this. Is it Halloween?
- Hey. How you doing?

120
00:09:22,301 --> 00:09:24,609
And it wasn't about them.

121
00:09:25,179 --> 00:09:28,561
It was all about this guy,
right here.

122
00:09:32,258 --> 00:09:34,587
Do you know who I am?

123
00:09:35,292 --> 00:09:37,590
You fucking bitch.

124
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:49,580
And this arrow through his throat...

125
00:09:51,233 --> 00:09:53,270
She wanted him to die slowly.

126
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,773
- She?
- We got a hair.

127
00:09:56,322 --> 00:10:00,286
- And he's got a new assassin.
- Who does?

128
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:03,310
Roman Beauvais Sionis.

129
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:06,240
Jesus Christ.

130
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,701
This is Montoya.
What the hell was that?

131
00:10:10,334 --> 00:10:12,336
Shit.

132
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:15,154
Wow.

133
00:10:15,234 --> 00:10:18,627
Detective.
Found this necklace.

134
00:10:20,332 --> 00:10:22,334
Holy shit.

135
00:10:23,231 --> 00:10:25,233
Good work, Officer.

136
00:10:25,337 --> 00:10:27,339
What is it?

137
00:10:28,434 --> 00:10:32,190
- Harley Quinn and the Joker broke up.
- What?

138
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:36,371
This was their spot. She just publicly
updated her relationship status.

139
00:10:36,451 --> 00:10:41,209
Harley Quinn just called
open season on herself.

140
00:10:41,289 --> 00:10:43,148
She did not
think this one through.

141
00:10:43,228 --> 00:10:45,379
<i>Yeah, no shit
I didn't think it through.</i>

142
00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:49,372
<i>I'm about to learn that a lot of
people in this city want me dead.</i>

143
00:10:49,452 --> 00:10:53,658
<i>And at the top of that list
is this guy.</i>

144
00:10:54,322 --> 00:10:57,818
Mr. Keo and his lovely
wife and daughter.

145
00:10:58,335 --> 00:11:02,854
You kinda forced my hand here.
Gotta say, I'm a little disappointed.

146
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:10,673
I gave you a great pitch.
Didn't I?

147
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,402
And I thought... Shh!

148
00:11:15,329 --> 00:11:18,262
I thought we could build
something beautiful together.

149
00:11:18,342 --> 00:11:20,660
I thought we could be family.

150
00:11:33,501 --> 00:11:35,872
I'm gonna set you free.

151
00:11:37,306 --> 00:11:39,308
Mmm...

152
00:11:40,278 --> 00:11:43,879
What about her?

153
00:11:48,888 --> 00:11:50,653
I think we can let her go.

154
00:11:50,657 --> 00:11:53,773
I mean, this is a pretty loud
fucking shitshow of a message.

155
00:11:58,523 --> 00:12:01,405
Baby. Aww.

156
00:12:01,485 --> 00:12:03,699
Don't cry.

157
00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:07,922
Thank you.
Thank you.

158
00:12:08,314 --> 00:12:10,316
You're welcome.

159
00:12:11,389 --> 00:12:13,310
Is that a snot bubble?

160
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:15,427
- Ew. Gross.
- What?

161
00:12:15,507 --> 00:12:17,899
Oh, I've changed my mind.
Peel it off.

162
00:12:18,406 --> 00:12:20,408
No. No!

163
00:12:22,336 --> 00:12:26,406
<i>The wack job with the penchant
for peeling faces is Roman Sionis,</i>

164
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,878
<i>aka Black Mask.</i>

165
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:36,300
<i>The fact that he wants me dead
hasn't yet hit my radar.</i>

166
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,959
<i>See, I was halfway across town,</i>

167
00:12:39,352 --> 00:12:42,922
<i>hungover,
and thinking about breakfast.</i>

168
00:12:44,439 --> 00:12:48,906
<i>Egg, bacon, American cheese.</i>

169
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:54,306
<i>Soft, toasted buttered roll.</i>

170
00:12:54,386 --> 00:12:56,464
<i>Just a dash of hot sauce.</i>

171
00:12:56,544 --> 00:13:00,426
Not too much, Sal.
I wanna taste the cheese.

172
00:13:00,506 --> 00:13:03,868
<i>What a way to
start my new life.</i>

173
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:08,986
<i>With the perfect egg sandwich.</i>

174
00:13:09,494 --> 00:13:11,495
Mmm!

175
00:13:11,588 --> 00:13:13,939
You're a lifesaver, Sal.

176
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:19,861
And I'm good for the 75 cents,
okay? I promise.

177
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:24,865
That's all the money I got
in the world, and it's so worth it.

178
00:13:27,551 --> 00:13:30,525
<i>I don't know if it's
the stray Armenian arm hair,</i>

179
00:13:30,606 --> 00:13:34,415
or the fact that his cheese slices
are always six months out of date,

180
00:13:34,495 --> 00:13:38,355
but no one makes
an egg sandwich like Sal.

181
00:13:38,436 --> 00:13:40,828
I mean it, Sal. No one.

182
00:13:55,894 --> 00:13:57,950
Freeze! Gotham PD.

183
00:13:57,965 --> 00:14:00,736
<i>Yeah, I don't think so.</i>

184
00:14:01,004 --> 00:14:03,396
Are you fucking kidding me?

185
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,466
Yo! Police.

186
00:14:08,546 --> 00:14:12,449
<i>It had been six short hours
since my little stunt at Ace Chemicals</i>

187
00:14:12,529 --> 00:14:16,515
<i>announced to the world
that Mr. J and I were dunzo.</i>

188
00:14:16,595 --> 00:14:20,937
<i>The immunity I'd enjoyed
for so long was gone.</i>

189
00:14:21,578 --> 00:14:24,397
<i>Cops who never would've dared
come after me before</i>

190
00:14:24,477 --> 00:14:26,848
<i>were suddenly doing this.</i>

191
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:35,417
- Ooh!
- Freeze!

192
00:14:35,498 --> 00:14:39,067
<i>And what's worse? Every person
I ever wronged now felt free</i>

193
00:14:39,438 --> 00:14:41,440
<i>to come and
take their pound of flesh.</i>

194
00:14:57,631 --> 00:15:01,013
<i>Turns out
I wronged a lot of people.</i>

195
00:15:02,657 --> 00:15:05,935
Come on, boy. Get him!

196
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,672
Oh...

197
00:15:22,644 --> 00:15:24,646
Finally.

198
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:35,637
<i>- And then...</i>
- We're gonna get through this, okay?

199
00:15:35,717 --> 00:15:37,963
<i>...tragedy struck.</i>

200
00:15:48,542 --> 00:15:52,232
<i>It took losing
something I truly love</i>

201
00:15:52,248 --> 00:15:55,435
<i>for me to see that
the target on my back</i>

202
00:15:55,527 --> 00:15:57,529
<i>was bigger than I thought.</i>

203
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,576
Freeze!

204
00:15:59,656 --> 00:16:02,200
<i>With the walls
closing in around me,</i>

205
00:16:02,267 --> 00:16:06,927
<i>I made a carefully calculated,
highly strategic move.</i>

206
00:16:14,731 --> 00:16:18,489
<i>Fine. It was dumb luck.
But still...</i>

207
00:16:18,569 --> 00:16:20,571
<i>That felt pretty great.</i>

208
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:26,454
Sorry for busting in on you like that,
but thanks for the shortcut.

209
00:16:26,534 --> 00:16:29,676
- See ya. Oh!
- There she is.

210
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:32,825
- Harley Quinn.
- Yeah?

211
00:16:33,686 --> 00:16:37,568
- I've waited a long time for this.
- You have?

212
00:16:37,648 --> 00:16:41,124
Oh... I haven't had breakfast yet.

213
00:16:42,538 --> 00:16:46,003
- What did I do to you?
- Are you serious?

214
00:16:46,688 --> 00:16:48,690
Look at my face.

215
00:16:48,773 --> 00:16:51,988
Look at my face!

216
00:16:57,645 --> 00:16:59,647
Oh...

217
00:17:00,595 --> 00:17:03,223
- That wasn't me.
- But you dared him to do it.

218
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,887
Yeah, but I dare a lot of people
to do a lot of things, okay?

219
00:17:05,888 --> 00:17:08,669
- Come on. I'm not even with him anymore.
- I know.

220
00:17:08,749 --> 00:17:13,576
That means there's
no one here to stop me.

221
00:17:14,754 --> 00:17:16,610
- Right.
- You're gonna die, Quinn.

222
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:18,792
Ooh. A penny.

223
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,008
They're shooting arrows now?

224
00:17:35,731 --> 00:17:38,282
Ah, crap. Him, too?

225
00:17:48,722 --> 00:17:50,724
Parley?

226
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:56,650
Fuck, Montoya, you smell
like a dead rat's asshole.

227
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:59,189
- Not today, Simpson.
- Hey, it's Detective Montoya.

228
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:02,623
Respect your elders.
I mean, your elderly.

229
00:18:02,703 --> 00:18:04,771
You're only a few years younger than me,
and you're still behind that desk.

230
00:18:04,851 --> 00:18:06,626
You wanna go there?

231
00:18:06,707 --> 00:18:08,660
Come on. Empty your pockets.
All of it.

232
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,766
Cassandra Cain,
back already?

233
00:18:10,846 --> 00:18:14,249
Thought by now you'd figure
out how not to get caught.

234
00:18:15,726 --> 00:18:17,727
What? No comeback?

235
00:18:20,688 --> 00:18:22,690
You all right?

236
00:18:22,846 --> 00:18:25,134
You smell like shit.

237
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:29,675
Yo, Simpson.

238
00:18:29,768 --> 00:18:32,191
Any clean clothes
in lost and found?

239
00:18:34,658 --> 00:18:38,176
These are serious accusations,
Miss Montoya.

240
00:18:38,661 --> 00:18:41,699
The Sionis family name is on half
the museums and schools in Gotham.

241
00:18:41,779 --> 00:18:44,275
And that makes him
immune to the law, Captain?

242
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:47,756
<i>Montoya's day is going
almost as badly as mine.</i>

243
00:18:47,836 --> 00:18:50,280
Remember the guy
who stole her promotion?

244
00:18:50,652 --> 00:18:53,679
That's him. He had four people
killed alone last night.

245
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:57,703
If Sionis is such a mastermind, how'd he
get fired from his own fucking company?

246
00:18:57,783 --> 00:19:00,716
The Janus Corporation
is his father's company, thank you.

247
00:19:00,796 --> 00:19:02,812
And by the way,
they cut him off.

248
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:05,710
Where does the DA's office
stand on all this?

249
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:08,765
To make matters worse, the assistant DA?
That's her ex.

250
00:19:08,845 --> 00:19:11,309
The evidence that Sionis is
linked to these murders...

251
00:19:11,702 --> 00:19:13,729
There's a shipment coming in.

252
00:19:13,811 --> 00:19:15,771
- Drugs?
- A diamond.

253
00:19:15,851 --> 00:19:18,004
Wow, Montoya. Should we call
the Feds for backup?

254
00:19:18,071 --> 00:19:20,307
Listen,
I had a source at the club.

255
00:19:20,342 --> 00:19:23,674
His driver. He said that Roman
couldn't stop talking about this thing.

256
00:19:23,754 --> 00:19:25,780
And he said that he overheard
something about laser-encoding.

257
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:29,836
Now, I did some research.
I think it's the Bertinelli diamond.

258
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:32,776
You remember the Bertinelli
massacre, right?

259
00:19:32,856 --> 00:19:36,633
<i>Quick history lesson. Fifteen years
ago, one of the wealthiest</i>

260
00:19:36,713 --> 00:19:38,823
<i>Mafia families in Gotham
was gunned down.</i>

261
00:19:38,903 --> 00:19:41,732
<i>It was a power grab,
but the real target</i>

262
00:19:41,812 --> 00:19:46,019
<i>was the Bertinellis' super-secret
offshore bank accounts,</i>

263
00:19:46,024 --> 00:19:49,163
<i>the details of which were said
to be encoded in the atomic structure</i>

264
00:19:49,244 --> 00:19:53,669
<i>of a 30-carat diamond.
The rock was lost.</i>

265
00:19:53,749 --> 00:19:56,745
<i>And with it, the only key
to the Bertinelli fortune.</i>

266
00:19:56,825 --> 00:20:01,344
Which is exactly why Roman Sionis
is trying to get his hands on it.

267
00:20:01,777 --> 00:20:04,856
That's what makes him so dangerous.
He's already building an army.

268
00:20:04,936 --> 00:20:07,839
If he gets the diamond, he'll
have all the money and connections

269
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,697
to bribe every single judge and cop
he needs to get a monopoly on the city.

270
00:20:12,777 --> 00:20:17,368
- You said you had someone on the inside?
- Yes. He's...

271
00:20:17,938 --> 00:20:21,684
- He's no longer there, but...
- So basically, you have nothing.

272
00:20:21,764 --> 00:20:23,759
You are trying to go after

273
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:26,720
one of the most litigious and
wealthiest families in Gotham,

274
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,753
and all you've got is
rumors and a hunch?

275
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:32,756
Well, you know, the DA's office
is building a case against him, too.

276
00:20:32,836 --> 00:20:35,874
- Isn't that right, Miss Yee?
- If the DA is willing to throw himself

277
00:20:35,954 --> 00:20:39,857
- out in front of this, it's fine with me.
- Captain, no.

278
00:20:39,937 --> 00:20:44,393
Listen, Munroe, find me some tangible
connection to Sionis, all right?

279
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,738
- Yes, sir.
- Wait, wait, wait. Captain.

280
00:20:46,818 --> 00:20:49,834
This is my case, okay? I've been
working on this for six months.

281
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:54,235
We need something that we
can actually use, Detective.

282
00:20:54,815 --> 00:20:56,817
And, Miss Montoya,
we do have a dress code.

283
00:21:00,565 --> 00:21:02,732
Look, I'm sorry about
that, but I...

284
00:21:02,812 --> 00:21:05,797
That is my job you are fucking with.
What is wrong with you, Renee?

285
00:21:05,877 --> 00:21:08,368
- Me? He gave my case away.
- Oh, poor Renee.

286
00:21:08,413 --> 00:21:10,739
Why don't you pour yourself
a drink? It's almost noon.

287
00:21:10,819 --> 00:21:12,821
Wow.

288
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:17,745
Jesus. Who the fuck is this?
What?

289
00:21:17,825 --> 00:21:20,758
<i>Why the fuck haven't you been picking
up your phone? We've got a situation.</i>

290
00:21:20,838 --> 00:21:23,740
- What... What situation?
- You didn't hear this from me,

291
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,805
but you gotta find her
before someone else does.

292
00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:27,900
She's got the diamond, and
trust me, Roman will kill her.

293
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,850
- My diamond? Who? Who's got it?
- This kid.

294
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:33,885
She's a pickpocket.
Her name's Cassandra Cain.

295
00:21:33,965 --> 00:21:36,346
Holy fuck.

296
00:21:46,871 --> 00:21:48,970
- Can I help you?
- Why, yes. Yes, you can.

297
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:52,224
I'm here to
report a terrible crime.

298
00:21:53,034 --> 00:21:55,446
And what terrible crime is that?

299
00:21:57,902 --> 00:21:59,904
This one.

300
00:22:16,065 --> 00:22:18,269
Hi, boys.

301
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:24,927
Meeting's over.

302
00:23:22,926 --> 00:23:25,319
Run, piggy, run.

303
00:23:33,018 --> 00:23:35,020
Where can I find
Cassandra Cain?

304
00:23:36,561 --> 00:23:40,893
<i> Hold up, hold up. I'm telling
this all wrong. Let's rewind.</i>

305
00:23:40,974 --> 00:23:43,969
<i>For you to understand why me,
the cop, and that dame on the toilet...</i>

306
00:23:44,049 --> 00:23:45,043
Her name's Cassandra Cain.

307
00:23:45,123 --> 00:23:47,984
<i>...are all looking for
this Cain character.</i>

308
00:23:48,064 --> 00:23:50,487
<i>I gotta take you back
a few days,</i>

309
00:23:51,015 --> 00:23:54,449
<i>to that night I got shitfaced
at the Black Mask Club.</i>

310
00:23:56,988 --> 00:24:02,373
<i>This is a man's world</i>

311
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:09,545
<i>This is a man's world...</i>

312
00:24:09,937 --> 00:24:13,549
<i>- This is Dinah Lance.</i>
- But it would be nothing

313
00:24:13,941 --> 00:24:18,553
<i>- But she prefers Black Canary.
- Nothing...</i>

314
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,931
<i>- She's got a killer voice.
- Without a woman or a girl...</i>

315
00:24:23,011 --> 00:24:25,069
<i>But there was some other shit
going down that night.</i>

316
00:24:25,149 --> 00:24:26,956
...short notice like this.

317
00:24:27,036 --> 00:24:29,062
I'm not talking
superficial partnerships.

318
00:24:29,142 --> 00:24:33,557
I'm talking you and me
having each other's backs.

319
00:24:33,636 --> 00:24:37,101
The Golden Lions can't just
wander into Gotham National Bank.

320
00:24:37,181 --> 00:24:41,574
I can.
Loans, liquidity, laundering.

321
00:24:41,987 --> 00:24:44,931
Look, if you bring your boys
into the fold,

322
00:24:45,011 --> 00:24:48,027
there are no limits to what
we could achieve together.

323
00:24:48,107 --> 00:24:51,081
I'm building something special.

324
00:24:51,161 --> 00:24:53,980
I appreciate your offer,
Mr. Sionis.

325
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:57,056
But with all due respect,

326
00:24:57,136 --> 00:24:59,528
the Golden Lions
are a family business.

327
00:25:00,003 --> 00:25:03,040
Fuck family. All due respect,
but fuck that.

328
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,013
Family's a fucking illusion. You know
what my family gave me? Nothing.

329
00:25:07,093 --> 00:25:10,119
I know what everyone says.
"Here comes Roman Sionis.

330
00:25:10,199 --> 00:25:12,623
"He was handed life
on a silver spoon."

331
00:25:13,015 --> 00:25:14,958
"Gin and tonics at 5:00."
"I'll have the duck."

332
00:25:15,038 --> 00:25:17,575
Blah, blah, blah.
Fake fucking fucks.

333
00:25:19,113 --> 00:25:21,631
But look at me now.

334
00:25:22,023 --> 00:25:26,082
I've located the Bertinelli diamond.
I'm about to own this city.

335
00:25:26,162 --> 00:25:30,054
Not just the East End.
I am thinking big, baby.

336
00:25:30,134 --> 00:25:35,080
And I want you there with me.
We could make our own family.

337
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,988
Mr. Sionis,
the Golden Lions have operated

338
00:25:38,068 --> 00:25:40,070
in Gotham
for nearly 100 years.

339
00:25:41,205 --> 00:25:43,628
We have no need
of your protection.

340
00:25:44,115 --> 00:25:46,579
He's gonna regret that.

341
00:25:55,104 --> 00:25:57,181
Will you sleep on it?
Will you do that for me?

342
00:25:57,261 --> 00:25:59,110
Run it by
that beautiful wife of yours,

343
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:01,999
and I'll come see you at
the docks, day after tomorrow.

344
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:04,081
Okay?

345
00:26:10,096 --> 00:26:14,187
<i>This is a man's world</i>

346
00:26:14,267 --> 00:26:16,991
<i>It would be nothing</i>

347
00:26:17,071 --> 00:26:19,073
<i>Without a woman or a girl...</i>

348
00:26:20,157 --> 00:26:23,038
Who's having a good time?
You are.

349
00:26:23,118 --> 00:26:26,040
<i>- Lost in the wilderness...</i>
- Food is good?

350
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,148
- Do you need any more cocktails?
<i>- Lost in the bitterness...</i>

351
00:26:29,228 --> 00:26:33,621
- Your good health.
<i>- He's lost in the loneliness...</i>

352
00:26:34,285 --> 00:26:37,082
<i>He's lost</i>

353
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:40,638
<i>This is a man's world</i>

354
00:26:41,114 --> 00:26:43,713
<i>It wouldn't be nothing</i>

355
00:26:53,165 --> 00:26:57,496
<i>Without a woman or a girl</i>

356
00:26:59,317 --> 00:27:02,167
<i>Canary's been singing
at Roman's club for years.</i>

357
00:27:02,247 --> 00:27:05,169
- Come on!
<i>- He calls her his little bird,</i>

358
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:09,580
<i>and he's got her wrapped
right around his fancy little finger.</i>

359
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:17,281
- Here you go, Canary.
- Thank you.

360
00:27:18,146 --> 00:27:20,705
How do you spell "mercenary"?

361
00:27:21,285 --> 00:27:23,520
Merceninny...

362
00:27:24,204 --> 00:27:26,206
Merceran?

363
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:34,247
Singer lady woman!

364
00:27:34,327 --> 00:27:37,188
You're really, really good.

365
00:27:37,268 --> 00:27:39,270
Yeah.

366
00:27:44,294 --> 00:27:46,769
Know what a harlequin is?

367
00:27:49,164 --> 00:27:51,293
Janky-ass clown
with bad eye makeup?

368
00:27:51,374 --> 00:27:53,254
Oof!

369
00:27:53,334 --> 00:27:55,579
Ouch!

370
00:27:58,339 --> 00:28:01,565
A harlequin's role

371
00:28:02,258 --> 00:28:04,608
is to serve.

372
00:28:05,147 --> 00:28:07,121
An audience.

373
00:28:07,201 --> 00:28:09,582
A master.

374
00:28:11,391 --> 00:28:15,566
You know, a harlequin's
nothing without a master.

375
00:28:17,231 --> 00:28:21,801
And no one gives two fucks
who we are beyond that.

376
00:28:30,388 --> 00:28:34,360
Yeah, I don't know who you think
I am, lady, but I'm not her.

377
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:38,671
Puddin' and I broke up.

378
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:48,617
I haven't told that to anyone.

379
00:28:49,342 --> 00:28:51,295
Yeah.

380
00:28:51,375 --> 00:28:53,704
For good this time.

381
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:58,803
And for the first time
in a long time,

382
00:29:00,237 --> 00:29:02,660
I'm all on my lonesome.

383
00:29:07,202 --> 00:29:09,204
It's great.

384
00:29:11,445 --> 00:29:13,764
Welcome to the club.

385
00:29:14,438 --> 00:29:16,318
Thanks.

386
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:20,332
Hey, don't be lonesome.
How about another drink?

387
00:29:20,412 --> 00:29:22,292
- Yes!
- Yeah?

388
00:29:22,372 --> 00:29:24,179
- Yeah.
- It's on me.

389
00:29:24,259 --> 00:29:26,724
- Sure. Drinks!
- Hey, two shots.

390
00:29:29,357 --> 00:29:31,359
Hey.

391
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:42,842
We're all good here.

392
00:29:56,246 --> 00:29:58,334
- I don't wanna go home.
- Oh, no? No.

393
00:29:58,414 --> 00:30:00,681
No.

394
00:30:02,283 --> 00:30:04,351
Let me know
if you're gonna get sick.

395
00:30:04,431 --> 00:30:07,290
Your chariot's arrived.
Oh, there you go.

396
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:10,293
- Are we getting breakfast?
- Hey, buddy, I'm gonna need some help.

397
00:30:10,373 --> 00:30:13,233
This is my friend.
I told you all about...

398
00:30:13,314 --> 00:30:16,821
- Hey, get the door, man. There we go.
- Wait.

399
00:30:17,421 --> 00:30:20,209
- Isn't that Joker's girl?
- Not anymore.

400
00:30:20,289 --> 00:30:23,304
- Got room for one more?
- Hey.

401
00:30:23,385 --> 00:30:25,386
Huh?

402
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,823
I don't need your help.
I got this.

403
00:30:31,372 --> 00:30:33,784
You got this?
You sure about that?

404
00:30:34,311 --> 00:30:36,313
Yeah, no wonder
everyone hates you.

405
00:30:39,347 --> 00:30:41,708
Uh...

406
00:30:51,369 --> 00:30:53,370
You got this!

407
00:30:54,308 --> 00:30:56,773
You motherfucker!

408
00:30:58,385 --> 00:31:00,387
Whoo!

409
00:31:03,358 --> 00:31:05,907
Well, well, well,
well, well, well.

410
00:31:06,444 --> 00:31:09,430
Could that be
our little Miss Lance?

411
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:12,257
All these years,
I thought she was just a pretty face

412
00:31:12,338 --> 00:31:14,728
and a fine set of lungs.

413
00:31:15,431 --> 00:31:17,353
Ooh.

414
00:31:17,433 --> 00:31:21,900
Mr. Zsasz,
I've had an amazing idea.

415
00:31:29,517 --> 00:31:31,867
That's my little bird.

416
00:31:34,469 --> 00:31:37,945
Don't touch
what you can't afford, mister.

417
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:40,391
Shut up.

418
00:31:41,381 --> 00:31:43,889
Oh, songbird.

419
00:31:44,457 --> 00:31:46,828
You drive
as good as you fight?

420
00:31:49,368 --> 00:31:52,353
- Who's asking?
- The boss.

421
00:31:52,433 --> 00:31:54,435
You're getting promoted.

422
00:31:56,593 --> 00:31:59,379
- You're his new driver.
- Huh. Thanks,

423
00:31:59,461 --> 00:32:02,393
but I think I'm good
with the singing gig.

424
00:32:02,473 --> 00:32:04,834
You'll be good
at the driving gig.

425
00:32:05,508 --> 00:32:09,515
Be here tomorrow.
9:00 a.m. Sharp.

426
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:12,413
<i>So, that's how Canary
got herself a job</i>

427
00:32:12,493 --> 00:32:14,978
<i>driving around
Gotham's newest Godfather.</i>

428
00:32:15,548 --> 00:32:18,502
<i>A position, I might add,
that wouldn't have been vacant</i>

429
00:32:18,582 --> 00:32:21,871
<i>without the help of yours truly.</i>

430
00:32:28,581 --> 00:32:30,582
Morning.

431
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:44,911
- You're the one who wanted the kid!
- I never wanted her!

432
00:32:46,618 --> 00:32:48,915
Let me guess. Parents?

433
00:32:49,484 --> 00:32:52,479
- Foster parents.
- Right.

434
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,512
Sorry, kid.

435
00:32:54,592 --> 00:32:57,025
Sorry about your face.

436
00:32:57,532 --> 00:33:00,361
Shit, you do have something
on your face.

437
00:33:00,441 --> 00:33:03,906
You should've seen
the other guy.

438
00:33:05,644 --> 00:33:07,513
Uh...

439
00:33:07,593 --> 00:33:10,370
I want that kid out
of my fucking house!

440
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:12,935
You know, kid, not every day
is gonna be like this.

441
00:33:13,547 --> 00:33:15,938
You just gotta hang in there.

442
00:33:21,595 --> 00:33:23,862
Get something to eat.

443
00:33:24,671 --> 00:33:27,939
Stay outta that.
It's not worth it.

444
00:33:36,546 --> 00:33:38,548
Don't talk to me like that.

445
00:33:40,633 --> 00:33:42,409

- Dinah Lance?
- Who the hell are you?

452
00:34:08,502 --> 00:34:11,967
I'm Renee Montoya,
detective with GCPD.

453
00:34:14,497 --> 00:34:18,025
Your predecessor
and I had an arrangement.

454
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,557
Oh, really?

455
00:34:19,637 --> 00:34:23,999
He told me that there was a
shipment coming in. A diamond.

456
00:34:24,485 --> 00:34:26,487
A very special diamond.

457
00:34:27,592 --> 00:34:30,974
Yeah, not interested, lady.
Thanks for the coffee.

458
00:34:32,597 --> 00:34:34,598
Do you know
who you're working for?

459
00:34:34,723 --> 00:34:38,543
Damn right, I do. He's the man who
gave me a job. Took me off the streets.

460
00:34:38,623 --> 00:34:41,503
Yeah, well, he's also
a very dangerous man.

461
00:34:41,584 --> 00:34:44,464
A criminal. A murderer.

462
00:34:44,544 --> 00:34:47,568
What would your mother think of you
working for a guy like that, huh?

463
00:34:47,683 --> 00:34:51,659
You have the same power she had. Don't
you think she would want you to use it?

464
00:34:51,739 --> 00:34:53,639
The hell do you know
about my mother?

465
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:56,673
Back in the day,
she used to help the GCPD.

466
00:34:56,753 --> 00:34:59,134
- She was a good woman.
- Yeah.

467
00:34:59,652 --> 00:35:01,657
She was a damn good woman.

468
00:35:01,737 --> 00:35:05,922
The kind of woman who put
everyone else's lives before her own.

469
00:35:06,533 --> 00:35:08,632
And when she was found
dead in the street,

470
00:35:08,712 --> 00:35:12,136
where the fuck were you
and your boys in blue then?

471
00:35:12,757 --> 00:35:16,670
Now you wanna come and knock on
my door and ask me to help you out

472
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:19,132
and make
the same mistake she did?

473
00:35:20,713 --> 00:35:24,032
Yeah. Good luck with that.

474
00:35:24,757 --> 00:35:29,130
That's fair enough.
And I'm sorry for your loss.

475
00:35:30,585 --> 00:35:32,587
For the record,

476
00:35:32,723 --> 00:35:36,188
that would never happen
on my watch.

477
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:41,173
The Sprang Bridge
Soldiers capituated.

478
00:35:41,637 --> 00:35:44,155
"Capitulated."
Of course they did.

479
00:35:44,547 --> 00:35:46,980
I told you that Keo scene
would send a message.

480
00:35:47,685 --> 00:35:51,577
It sure did, boss.
It sure fucking did.

481
00:35:51,657 --> 00:35:54,132
Crossbow Killer

482
00:35:54,753 --> 00:35:58,698
struck again last night.
Rossi and four of his guys.

483
00:35:58,778 --> 00:36:01,700
People don't kill people I own
without my permission.

484
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:03,702
Why doesn't this crossbow guy
know that?

485
00:36:03,782 --> 00:36:05,611
- You know that!
- I know it.

486
00:36:05,691 --> 00:36:08,644
Why doesn't this crossbow guy?
Why don't I own the crossbow guy?

487
00:36:08,725 --> 00:36:11,168
- You should own him.
- I mean, I like crossbows.

488
00:36:11,768 --> 00:36:13,711
Oh, good morning.
Good morning.

489
00:36:13,791 --> 00:36:15,672
- Morning.
- Come in. Come in.

490
00:36:15,752 --> 00:36:18,580
We're just finishing up a
little business. Look around.

491
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,613
- You're late.
- It's fine.

492
00:36:20,693 --> 00:36:22,605
Should she come back another
time, 'cause she's late?

493
00:36:22,685 --> 00:36:25,045
No. Isn't this stunning?

494
00:36:26,594 --> 00:36:29,236
That is a Chokwe mask.

495
00:36:29,753 --> 00:36:32,645
I got it when I was embedded
with the Mbangani tribe

496
00:36:32,725 --> 00:36:34,689
in Congo-Kinshasa.
Have you ever been?

497
00:36:34,769 --> 00:36:37,524
I've never been.
I've heard it's beautiful.

498
00:36:37,604 --> 00:36:42,737
It's dirty. Here, look at this.
Genuine tsantsa or shrunken head.

499
00:36:42,817 --> 00:36:46,553
Shuar of Ecuador. They're
amazing people. Surprisingly gentle.

500
00:36:46,633 --> 00:36:48,576
- I think you might like them.
- Really?

501
00:36:48,656 --> 00:36:52,621
They boil the heads of their enemies
and they make these little fellas.

502
00:36:52,701 --> 00:36:54,592
- Exquisite, aren't they? Look.
- Mmm-hmm.

503
00:36:54,672 --> 00:36:57,667
Look at those little ears.
And his little haircut.

504
00:36:57,747 --> 00:36:59,658
- Yeah, he's 1,000 years old.
- Wow.

505
00:36:59,738 --> 00:37:01,608
And now he's just an ornament
in my living room.

506
00:37:01,688 --> 00:37:03,662
- Ew! I love it.
- Yeah?

507
00:37:03,742 --> 00:37:05,611
These are
ancient acupuncture models.

508
00:37:05,691 --> 00:37:07,790
As you can see, they have
all the acupuncture points.

509
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:11,273
And we found these
buried in the mountains.

510
00:37:11,666 --> 00:37:14,609
Ace Chemicals
got blown sky high last night.

511
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:18,103
All right, all right, let's find
the Crossbow Killer. I get it.

512
00:37:18,662 --> 00:37:21,720
- Is he an acupuncture model, too?
- He is not an acupuncture model.

513
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,796
This is a statue of me. It was made
by a very famous Gotham artist...

514
00:37:24,876 --> 00:37:27,195
Harley Quinn did it.

515
00:37:27,805 --> 00:37:30,270
Some kind of "fuck you"
to the Joker.

516
00:37:30,787 --> 00:37:32,789
They split.

517
00:37:32,893 --> 00:37:35,223
What's wrong with you, Victor?

518
00:37:35,781 --> 00:37:38,746
- Talk about burying the lede.
- Yeah.

519
00:37:38,826 --> 00:37:41,300
This is spectacular news!

520
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:44,283
She doesn't belong to him,
she belongs to me.

521
00:37:44,674 --> 00:37:47,733
Have the boys go find her. Round her up,
bring her back. I want her.

522
00:37:47,813 --> 00:37:49,745
You, I have something
I want you to pick me up.

523
00:37:49,825 --> 00:37:52,290
Something super-duper
important, okay?

524
00:37:52,314 --> 00:37:54,552
- I'll go with you.
- Yeah, go with Victor.

525
00:37:54,633 --> 00:37:56,814
- It's just a pickup.
- No, he's harmless.

526
00:37:56,894 --> 00:37:59,244
Do as you're told. Go.

527
00:38:13,773 --> 00:38:16,780
- All right. We can go.
- I'll take that.

528
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:20,739
- Mr. S said for me to hold on to it.
- Go get your car.

529
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:25,840
<i>That rock. That rock's
about to become the key</i>

530
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,188
<i>to whether or not I live to
enjoy my newfound independence.</i>

531
00:38:33,739 --> 00:38:36,683
- Get off me.
- What the hell are you doing here?

532
00:38:36,763 --> 00:38:40,172
You're not the only one who makes
money off of dumb, rich, white people.

533
00:38:40,253 --> 00:38:43,731
Well, you know what? One day you're
gonna pick the wrong pocket, sis.

534
00:38:43,811 --> 00:38:46,244
Okay. Whatever.

535
00:38:48,857 --> 00:38:51,238
Dumb-ass kids.

536
00:38:52,839 --> 00:38:55,169
Excuse me. Sorry.

537
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:08,274
- I really like your earrings.
- Why, thank you.

538
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:12,153
There's the thief.
There's the thief.

539
00:39:13,942 --> 00:39:17,835
- Get off of me!
- That little girl took my watch.

540
00:39:17,915 --> 00:39:20,233
I didn't do nothing.

541
00:39:22,783 --> 00:39:25,769
Where the fuck's the diamond?
I just fucking had it.

542
00:39:25,849 --> 00:39:27,851
Cass!

543
00:39:28,987 --> 00:39:30,710
Wait!

544
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:32,792
Wait, wait!

545
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:34,756
Halt!

546
00:39:34,836 --> 00:39:36,838
Fuck!

547
00:39:55,980 --> 00:40:00,893
<i>In the storytelling business,
this dummy swallowing that diamond</i>

548
00:40:00,973 --> 00:40:03,964
<i>is called a complication.</i>

549
00:40:04,914 --> 00:40:09,203
<i>A complication I didn't
exactly need right now.</i>

550
00:40:11,805 --> 00:40:13,807
Parley?

551
00:40:15,903 --> 00:40:18,888
- We lost the diamond.
- What?

552
00:40:18,968 --> 00:40:20,858
We're really sorry, Mr. S.
This kid...

553
00:40:20,938 --> 00:40:23,372
We never even
got our hands on it.

554
00:40:24,828 --> 00:40:26,759
Ow!

555
00:40:26,839 --> 00:40:28,813
Help!

556
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:32,017
Get out! Get out of here!
You, too! Go!

557
00:40:32,098 --> 00:40:35,383
With your fucking sage
stinking my place up. Fuck off!

558
00:40:35,816 --> 00:40:37,977
- Here she is.
- She's a child!

559
00:40:38,057 --> 00:40:40,793
- She's just a kid.
- She's... What?

560
00:40:40,873 --> 00:40:42,899
We have Harley Quinn
downstairs, as requested.

561
00:40:42,979 --> 00:40:45,922
Fuck off! Get out.
Fucking out!

562
00:40:46,003 --> 00:40:49,759
Fuck! These are my things.
This diamond is my things.

563
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:52,866
My things! Fucking fuck!
I don't ask for much, do I?

564
00:40:52,946 --> 00:40:54,784
- No.
- Why is this happening to me?

565
00:40:54,864 --> 00:40:56,866
Why?

566
00:40:57,836 --> 00:41:01,906
I'm gonna get your diamond back.
I promise.

567
00:41:01,986 --> 00:41:07,339
Why don't we go downstairs
and kill that Harley bitch?

568
00:41:08,053 --> 00:41:10,414
Blow off a little steam.

569
00:41:10,931 --> 00:41:13,489
Yeah, I have wanted to do that
for quite some time.

570
00:41:15,081 --> 00:41:18,380
Okay. I'll go get changed.

571
00:41:33,087 --> 00:41:35,374
Shit, Cass.

572
00:41:40,061 --> 00:41:43,485
I don't care what it
takes, I want my diamond back.

573
00:41:43,877 --> 00:41:45,913
We're working on it.

574
00:41:45,993 --> 00:41:49,282
Now, let's go have a little fun.

575
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:58,049
Harleen Quinzel.

576
00:41:58,129 --> 00:42:00,131
Whoo!

577
00:42:01,007 --> 00:42:03,008
Hiya, Romy.

578
00:42:03,926 --> 00:42:05,983
Do you know why you're here?
Hmm?

579
00:42:06,063 --> 00:42:07,975
<i>When it comes to
me and Roman Sionis,</i>

580
00:42:08,055 --> 00:42:10,467
<i>there are a lot of possible
answers to this question.</i>

581
00:42:10,954 --> 00:42:13,865
<i>Breaking his driver's legs. There's
that time I called it an "expresso."</i>

582
00:42:13,945 --> 00:42:16,410
<i>Having a vagina in the first
place pisses this guy off.</i>

583
00:42:20,129 --> 00:42:22,998
<i>Constantly interrupting him,
like I'm doing right now.</i>

584
00:42:23,078 --> 00:42:25,333
- You're here because...
- Oh, God, stop.

585
00:42:25,432 --> 00:42:29,067
You're gonna do that thing where you open
up a weird-ass case of torture devices

586
00:42:29,147 --> 00:42:33,039
while inexplicably detailing your
master plan and how I don't fit into it.

587
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:36,052
- I'm building a better...
- Seriously, you don't have to. Really!

588
00:42:36,132 --> 00:42:39,355
You're building a criminal empire because
Daddy kicked you out of Janus Corp.

589
00:42:39,392 --> 00:42:41,025
And you think this is a big
"fuck you," but in actuality

590
00:42:41,106 --> 00:42:43,016
it's a very misguided attempt
to win back his respect.

591
00:42:43,096 --> 00:42:46,895
I get it. You're really not
as complicated as you think.

592
00:42:46,975 --> 00:42:48,918
And you're really not as
clever as you think, because

593
00:42:48,998 --> 00:42:50,971
- now I'm gonna slice your...
- Oh, Jesus Christmas.

594
00:42:51,051 --> 00:42:54,119
Now you're gonna say that you
wanna kill me to set an example.

595
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:57,492
- Christ, you're boring.
- I wanna kill you...

596
00:42:57,573 --> 00:43:00,471
- Shit.
- ...because without the Joker around,

597
00:43:01,988 --> 00:43:03,990
I can.

598
00:43:06,138 --> 00:43:10,948
For all your noise and bluster,
you're just a silly little girl

599
00:43:11,028 --> 00:43:13,690
with no one around
to protect her.

600
00:43:17,578 --> 00:43:19,281
- Whoa. Wait.
- What?

601
00:43:19,368 --> 00:43:21,019
- Don't kill me.
- Ha! Right.

602
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:24,919
No, no, no. Seriously. Romy, Roman.
Come on. There's gotta be something,

603
00:43:24,999 --> 00:43:27,001
something we can figure out.
Hey!

604
00:43:27,116 --> 00:43:29,120
Wait, wait!
You lost something, right?

605
00:43:29,201 --> 00:43:33,069
You lost something.
I heard you say it. A diamond.

606
00:43:37,979 --> 00:43:39,981
Yeah.

607
00:43:40,127 --> 00:43:42,122
I can help you find it.

608
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:45,594
Seriously. Look in my pocket.

609
00:43:48,989 --> 00:43:50,991
Other pocket.

610
00:43:59,133 --> 00:44:01,055
I'm starting up
my own business.

611
00:44:01,135 --> 00:44:03,137
See what it says?
Second from the bottom.

612
00:44:07,099 --> 00:44:09,522
I know the East End
better than anybody.

613
00:44:10,133 --> 00:44:13,066
You want this diamond back?
I'm your gal.

614
00:44:13,146 --> 00:44:16,944
Mr. J once lost a rare photograph
of a nude Eleanor Roosevelt,

615
00:44:17,024 --> 00:44:19,061
and I found it in a bird's
nest in Robinson Park.

616
00:44:19,141 --> 00:44:21,125
If you let me go,

617
00:44:21,205 --> 00:44:25,129
just for now,
I'll get you that rock back.

618
00:44:25,209 --> 00:44:27,632
What have you got to lose?
If your boys find it first,

619
00:44:28,024 --> 00:44:29,575
swear to God,
you can kill me later.

620
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:32,073
Pinky swear.
Cross my heart, hope to fart.

621
00:44:32,153 --> 00:44:34,155
You're so tiresome!

622
00:44:35,145 --> 00:44:40,142
If you want my mercy, shut that hole
in the middle of your face and listen.

623
00:44:40,222 --> 00:44:43,511
You're gonna
get me my diamond.

624
00:44:49,137 --> 00:44:54,040
<i>A kiss on the hand
May be quite continental</i>

625
00:44:54,121 --> 00:44:57,680
<i>But diamonds are
a girl's best friend</i>

626
00:44:59,073 --> 00:45:01,203
<i>A kiss may be grand</i>

627
00:45:01,283 --> 00:45:05,666
<i>But it won't pay the rental
On your humble flat</i>

628
00:45:06,058 --> 00:45:08,680
<i>Or help you at the automat</i>

629
00:45:11,146 --> 00:45:13,067
<i>Diamonds</i>

630
00:45:13,148 --> 00:45:14,089
<i> I will be waiting.</i>

631
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:15,121
<i>Diamonds</i>

632
00:45:15,201 --> 00:45:16,164
<i>Diamonds</i>

633
00:45:16,244 --> 00:45:18,083
<i> The diamond.</i>

634
00:45:18,163 --> 00:45:19,156
<i>Diamonds</i>

635
00:45:19,236 --> 00:45:21,231
Romy, Roman.

636
00:45:21,311 --> 00:45:23,557
<i>I will be waiting.</i>

637
00:45:25,127 --> 00:45:26,183
<i>But diamonds</i>

638
00:45:26,263 --> 00:45:29,552
<i>Diamonds are a girl's best</i>

639
00:45:33,176 --> 00:45:35,579
I'll give you till midnight.

640
00:45:36,241 --> 00:45:39,216
And then I'm gonna peel off
that pretty face

641
00:45:39,296 --> 00:45:41,625
and pickle it.

642
00:45:42,153 --> 00:45:44,154
Okay?

643
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,246
<i>Call me old-fashioned,
but I always thought the guy</i>

644
00:45:49,326 --> 00:45:51,645
<i>was meant to
get the girl a diamond.</i>

645
00:45:56,332 --> 00:45:59,234
I won't let you down, Romy.
I promise.

646
00:45:59,314 --> 00:46:01,257
Let's make it half a mil.

647
00:46:01,337 --> 00:46:04,071
It's more fun
if she's got competition.

648
00:46:04,151 --> 00:46:06,752
Send it to
every mercenary in Gotham.

649
00:46:07,227 --> 00:46:09,191
Oh, hey, you're that singer
no one listens to.

650
00:46:09,271 --> 00:46:11,725
Hey, you're the asshole
no one likes.

651
00:46:29,279 --> 00:46:32,169
Jesus. Who the fuck is this?
What?

652
00:46:32,249 --> 00:46:35,131
<i>We've got a situation.
This kid, she's got the diamond.</i>

653
00:46:35,211 --> 00:46:37,122
Her name's Cassandra Cain.

654
00:46:37,202 --> 00:46:39,204
Holy fuck.

655
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:44,066
Where can I find
Cassandra Cain?

656
00:46:44,146 --> 00:46:46,148
<i>Okay. Now we're good.</i>

657
00:46:49,286 --> 00:46:51,287
Cell seven.

658
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:57,797
Thanks, doll. You're a peach.

659
00:47:00,316 --> 00:47:02,318
Hey, I know that guy.

660
00:47:20,396 --> 00:47:23,266
<i>Access denied. Access denied.</i>

661
00:47:23,346 --> 00:47:25,728
<i>Access denied. Access denied.</i>

662
00:47:26,391 --> 00:47:28,208
<i>Access denied.
Access denied. Denied.</i>

663
00:47:28,288 --> 00:47:31,628
<i>Denied. Denied. Denied.
Denied. Denied. Denied.</i>

664
00:47:34,304 --> 00:47:36,644
Hmm. Perfect.

665
00:47:51,371 --> 00:47:54,336
- Hold up, hold up. Remember me?
- She stole my car!

666
00:47:54,416 --> 00:47:56,191
- Harley Quinn.
- Hey, Quinn!

667
00:47:56,271 --> 00:47:58,141
- Let us out, see what happens.
- Don't mind me, guys.

668
00:47:58,221 --> 00:48:00,164
- You killed my chinchilla!
- Here for the kid.

669
00:48:00,244 --> 00:48:02,176
What's up, girl?
You're the reason I'm in here!

670
00:48:02,256 --> 00:48:05,199
- Yeah, sorry about that.
- You're dead!

671
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,254
- I'm gonna kill you, Quinn!
- Hey, kid.

672
00:48:08,334 --> 00:48:10,371
- You're that psycho from the roller derby.
- Yeah, yeah.

673
00:48:10,451 --> 00:48:13,224
- Are you Cassandra Cain?
- Yeah.

674
00:48:25,361 --> 00:48:27,362
I need to know where...

675
00:48:38,247 --> 00:48:41,302
- Hold, please.
- Harley...

676
00:50:01,425 --> 00:50:03,427
Hmm.

677
00:50:06,482 --> 00:50:08,749
I got you, you little shit.

678
00:50:09,495 --> 00:50:11,496
Who are you guys?

679
00:50:12,414 --> 00:50:14,416
Go, go, go.

680
00:50:16,501 --> 00:50:18,503
Keep the kid alive.

681
00:51:16,493 --> 00:51:18,494
Mmm!

682
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:21,582
A little help.

683
00:52:27,587 --> 00:52:29,589
Mmm...

684
00:52:39,567 --> 00:52:41,917
Does she have to keep running?

685
00:53:10,522 --> 00:53:13,132
Roman,
you trustafarian fuckbag.

686
00:53:15,557 --> 00:53:17,573
- You!
- You!

687
00:53:17,653 --> 00:53:19,951
Step away from the kid.

688
00:53:20,604 --> 00:53:24,423
- Drop it.
- The phone?

689
00:53:24,503 --> 00:53:26,505
Sure.

690
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,601
Mmm.

691
00:54:00,535 --> 00:54:02,457
Whoa.

692
00:54:02,537 --> 00:54:06,013
Oh, good. You're awake.
Toss that for me, will ya?

693
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:21,536
What the fuck?

694
00:54:21,616 --> 00:54:23,517
Who did I just blow up?

695
00:54:23,597 --> 00:54:25,540
Either someone
who wants me dead,

696
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:28,991
or someone looking to collect the
half-million dollar reward on your head.

697
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:32,503
- Half a million dollars?
- Yeah.

698
00:54:32,583 --> 00:54:35,090
Do I look like I'm
worth half a million dollars?

699
00:54:35,576 --> 00:54:37,497
- Not really.
- You've got the wrong kid.

700
00:54:37,578 --> 00:54:40,719
- Now, uncuff me.
- Oh, sure.

701
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:44,636
- As soon as you give me the diamond.
- What diamond?

702
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:52,664
Fuck you!

703
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:55,667
Look at me.

704
00:54:57,721 --> 00:55:01,561
What? I don't know
nothing about no diamond.

705
00:55:01,641 --> 00:55:03,646
The inflection in your voice,
the way you can't hold eye contact,

706
00:55:03,726 --> 00:55:05,544
and the fact that
you're a filthy little thief,

707
00:55:05,624 --> 00:55:09,557
all suggest that you do. Now, you
can give it to me, or I can give you

708
00:55:09,637 --> 00:55:12,758
to the man that diamond belongs to. But
trust me when I say, you're not gonna like

709
00:55:12,838 --> 00:55:15,001
what he's gonna do to ya.

710
00:55:15,602 --> 00:55:18,129
Now, hand it over.

711
00:55:18,666 --> 00:55:21,131
Yeah, not gonna happen.

712
00:55:22,628 --> 00:55:24,728
- Come again?
- I said I can't.

713
00:55:24,808 --> 00:55:27,378
- One more time.
- I can't give it to you.

714
00:55:27,713 --> 00:55:30,223
- Why not?
- Because I ate it, okay?

715
00:55:37,641 --> 00:55:39,643
Yes.

716
00:55:39,727 --> 00:55:42,122
What are we even doing here?

717
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:45,028
There are two ways that
diamond's coming outta ya.

718
00:55:45,669 --> 00:55:47,671
This way,

719
00:55:47,859 --> 00:55:50,125
or this way.

720
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:55,647
That's what I thought.
Also, I'm outta groceries.

721
00:55:58,723 --> 00:56:02,053
So, how long you been
a mercenary?

722
00:56:02,654 --> 00:56:04,321
Hey, where did you get...

723
00:56:04,383 --> 00:56:06,586
You're so busy
looking at my right hand,

724
00:56:06,678 --> 00:56:08,569
you haven't even
thought about my left...

725
00:56:08,649 --> 00:56:11,051
Your left hand is
cuffed to mine.

726
00:56:14,810 --> 00:56:17,171
I'll have to learn that one.

727
00:56:17,802 --> 00:56:19,662
Can we get this?

728
00:56:19,742 --> 00:56:21,789
You're not gonna try
to run, are you?

729
00:56:21,869 --> 00:56:24,302
Look, if there's really
a half mil on my head,

730
00:56:24,694 --> 00:56:27,679
I figure I'm better off with the person
who's not gonna cut me open.

731
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:30,651
Fine. But if you try to run,
I will kill you.

732
00:56:30,731 --> 00:56:33,175
I do not care
that you're a kid.

733
00:56:35,756 --> 00:56:37,758
I saw that.

734
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:40,754
Seriously though,
how'd you get to be here?

735
00:56:40,834 --> 00:56:44,310
I mean,
shopping at fancy-ass stores,

736
00:56:44,701 --> 00:56:47,822
you're making bank,
you have your own business.

737
00:56:47,902 --> 00:56:52,639
How'd you do it? Come on, tell me.
Woman to woman.

738
00:56:52,719 --> 00:56:56,674
Being a pickpocket's fine and
all, but I got real potential.

739
00:56:56,754 --> 00:56:58,687
I mean, how do I be like you?

740
00:56:58,767 --> 00:57:02,315
Well, except for the crazy
part. But other than that.

741
00:57:02,811 --> 00:57:05,776
Number one, no one is like me.

742
00:57:05,856 --> 00:57:08,831
If you wanted to even come close,
you would have to go to medical school.

743
00:57:08,911 --> 00:57:13,710
Become a psychiatrist, work in an
asylum. Fall in love with your patient,

744
00:57:13,790 --> 00:57:16,775
break said patient out of said asylum.
Begin a life of crime.

745
00:57:16,855 --> 00:57:18,861
Jump into a vat of chemicals
to prove yourself to a madman.

746
00:57:18,941 --> 00:57:20,821
Get arrested by the Batman.

747
00:57:20,901 --> 00:57:22,749
Go back to jail, get out of
jail with a bomb on your neck.

748
00:57:22,829 --> 00:57:24,647
Save the world, go back to
jail, and break out of jail

749
00:57:24,727 --> 00:57:26,784
before breaking up
with the aforementioned madman

750
00:57:26,864 --> 00:57:29,173
and going out on your own.

751
00:57:31,733 --> 00:57:34,885
Number two...
Six bucks for tap water

752
00:57:34,965 --> 00:57:38,855
with a fucking cucumber stick in it?
That's crazy.

753
00:57:39,824 --> 00:57:42,226
I'm not shopping
at this store.

754
00:57:43,838 --> 00:57:47,897
I'm robbing this store.
Consider this your first lesson.

755
00:57:47,977 --> 00:57:51,151
Paying is for dummies.

756
00:57:56,871 --> 00:57:58,667
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

757
00:57:58,747 --> 00:58:00,749
Move it!

758
00:58:05,764 --> 00:58:07,766
Whoops. Ah...

759
00:58:08,996 --> 00:58:12,316
This is Doc's Place.
And this is Doc.

760
00:58:14,876 --> 00:58:16,767
Lotus flower!

761
00:58:16,847 --> 00:58:18,925
- Hiya, Doc. How are ya?
- Good.

762
00:58:19,005 --> 00:58:21,719
He's the Taiwanese grandpa
I never had.

763
00:58:21,799 --> 00:58:24,920
He knows everything and everyone. Nothing
happens around here, let me tell you,

764
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:29,393
without Doc knowing about it.
And he happens to be the only person

765
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,811
who actually cares about me.

766
00:58:31,891 --> 00:58:33,730
- I do?
- Yes, you do.

767
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:36,910
She's been ordering #32
with extra chili for many years.

768
00:58:36,990 --> 00:58:40,746
Lesson number two,
you always want extra chili with #32.

769
00:58:40,826 --> 00:58:42,725
So you don't have
to taste his cooking.

770
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:45,345
Lotus flower, you have to get
upstairs before someone sees.

771
00:58:45,810 --> 00:58:50,214
- Everyone's looking for you. And you.
- We know.

772
00:58:50,294 --> 00:58:53,310
I'm telling you, if you want
boys to respect you,

773
00:58:53,390 --> 00:58:55,760
you have to show them
that you're serious.

774
00:58:56,289 --> 00:58:58,805
Blow something up.
Shoot someone.

775
00:58:59,458 --> 00:59:01,902
Nothing gets a guy's attention
like violence.

776
00:59:02,294 --> 00:59:04,268
Shut that door. Lock it.

777
00:59:04,348 --> 00:59:06,802
Keep your sticky paws
to yourself, okay?

778
00:59:17,349 --> 00:59:20,460
This place... Well, it ain't much,
but it's better than a prison cell.

779
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:22,858
...is so fucking dope.

780
00:59:24,501 --> 00:59:27,445
Oh, shit. Is that
a hyena in a bathtub?

781
00:59:27,525 --> 00:59:30,886
I named him Bruce after
that hunky Wayne guy.

782
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:33,429
He's my little dumpling,
aren't you?

783
00:59:33,509 --> 00:59:37,955
Aren't you, my little baby?
Aren't you, Brucey? Yes.

784
00:59:38,347 --> 00:59:40,348
I love you.

785
00:59:41,474 --> 00:59:44,491
I never said that.
I love you both equally.

786
00:59:44,571 --> 00:59:49,747
Who, that? It's Cass.

787
00:59:51,535 --> 00:59:53,537
You're so pretty.

788
00:59:55,352 --> 00:59:57,354
Who's this?

789
00:59:57,437 --> 00:59:59,369
It's a beaver.

790
00:59:59,449 --> 01:00:01,451
Hmm.

791
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:07,784
Does Brucey want a treat?
Does Brucey want a treat?

792
01:00:09,416 --> 01:00:11,418
What's this?

793
01:00:14,452 --> 01:00:16,833
It's art. Don't touch.

794
01:00:19,467 --> 01:00:21,472
He your ex or something?

795
01:00:21,552 --> 01:00:23,850
You don't know who that is?

796
01:00:24,576 --> 01:00:26,331
The Joker.

797
01:00:26,411 --> 01:00:30,490
The Clown Prince of Crime?
My former partner in madness?

798
01:00:30,570 --> 01:00:33,348
The Harlequin of Hate?
The Jester of Genocide?

799
01:00:33,428 --> 01:00:37,852
- You've never heard of him?
- Well, sounds like a dick.

800
01:00:40,496 --> 01:00:42,498
Huh.

801
01:00:51,527 --> 01:00:53,529
Milk.

802
01:01:03,496 --> 01:01:07,378
<i>I'm not going soft
or nothing, but I gotta admit,</i>

803
01:01:07,458 --> 01:01:09,913
it was kinda nice
having the kid around.

804
01:01:20,522 --> 01:01:23,393
Give me a #32. Mild.

805
01:01:23,473 --> 01:01:25,864
Uh... Yeah, sure.

806
01:01:28,904 --> 01:01:33,683
{\an8}I've been told that you know all
the scum of this disgusting city.

807
01:01:34,323 --> 01:01:36,658
{\an8}I need you to help me find someone.

808
01:01:41,571 --> 01:01:44,974
{\an8}I know everybody,
apparently, except for you.

809
01:01:46,554 --> 01:01:49,863
- Who are you?
- They call me...

810
01:01:51,538 --> 01:01:52,480
H...

811
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:54,491
<i>My bad.
I should've introduced you.</i>

812
01:01:54,571 --> 01:01:56,573
<i>I'll make it quick.</i>

813
01:02:00,484 --> 01:02:05,481
<i>Meet the daughter of the richest,
most powerful Mafia don in Gotham City.</i>

814
01:02:05,561 --> 01:02:08,078
<i>Helena Bertinelli.</i>

815
01:02:08,470 --> 01:02:10,966
<i>Yep, that Bertinelli.</i>

816
01:02:12,536 --> 01:02:16,106
<i>One day, she comes home to find
her whole family in the living room.</i>

817
01:02:16,498 --> 01:02:18,500
Momma.

818
01:02:19,584 --> 01:02:23,978
<i>Anyone and everyone with
Bertinelli blood is there.</i>

819
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:28,606
<i>Oh, and that?
That's Stefano Galante.</i>

820
01:02:28,686 --> 01:02:32,986
<i>The guy making the play
for the Bertinelli turf and fortune.</i>

821
01:02:56,586 --> 01:02:59,623
<i>When one of the goons
finds the kid alive,</i>

822
01:02:59,703 --> 01:03:04,492
<i>the big softy sneaks her outta
there and hides her away in Sicily.</i>

823
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:08,520
<i>Where she is raised by his own
father and brother.</i>

824
01:03:08,601 --> 01:03:10,757
<i>Both assassins.</i>

825
01:03:17,563 --> 01:03:21,957
<i>She spends the next 15 years
thinking only of revenge.</i>

826
01:03:22,588 --> 01:03:24,590
<i>So, she starts training.</i>

827
01:03:25,768 --> 01:03:28,545
<i>When she was ready,
and by "ready" I mean</i>

828
01:03:28,625 --> 01:03:35,624
<i>a badass motherfucking killing
machine, she moves back to Gotham.</i>

829
01:03:35,704 --> 01:03:37,706
<i>Starts working
on that kill list.</i>

830
01:03:45,755 --> 01:03:48,178
<i>She has the murder stuff down,
but the rest?</i>

831
01:03:48,569 --> 01:03:51,701
Do you know who I am?
Do you know who I am?

832
01:03:51,781 --> 01:03:53,783
<i>Still a work in progress.</i>

833
01:03:55,743 --> 01:03:59,489
- Do you know who I am?
- The Crossbow Killer.

834
01:03:59,569 --> 01:04:02,565
- They call me...
- The Crossbow Killer.

835
01:04:02,645 --> 01:04:06,704
- They call me...
- The Crossbow Killer?

836
01:04:06,784 --> 01:04:08,978
They call me...

837
01:04:11,653 --> 01:04:15,546
- Huntress.
<i>- She calls herself Huntress.</i>

838
01:04:15,626 --> 01:04:18,111
<i>Fucking fabulous, if you ask me.</i>

839
01:04:18,617 --> 01:04:21,124
And who are you looking for?

840
01:04:27,594 --> 01:04:30,527
- Great club.
- Quinn got the girl.

841
01:04:30,607 --> 01:04:34,083
- And?
- And they disappeared.

842
01:04:35,685 --> 01:04:38,046
Fuck!

843
01:04:38,771 --> 01:04:40,773
Fuck!

844
01:04:46,779 --> 01:04:49,045
What is she laughing at?

845
01:04:50,646 --> 01:04:52,766
- Is she laughing at me?
- She is.

846
01:04:52,846 --> 01:04:55,216
No, she's not. She's...

847
01:04:55,221 --> 01:04:57,635
What are you laughing at,
Erika?

848
01:04:57,673 --> 01:05:01,753
- You gotta hear this. It's hilarious.
- Get on the table.

849
01:05:01,833 --> 01:05:03,599
- Oh.
- Ooh.

850
01:05:03,679 --> 01:05:06,039
You're being a total kook.

851
01:05:06,775 --> 01:05:09,052
Get on the fucking table.

852
01:05:10,695 --> 01:05:13,274
This is my club. Get up now.

853
01:05:13,834 --> 01:05:16,059
- Okay.
- Now.

854
01:05:17,858 --> 01:05:20,051
Whoa.

855
01:05:21,757 --> 01:05:23,759
Now, dance.

856
01:05:28,836 --> 01:05:31,270
Dance. Dance, Erika!

857
01:05:31,662 --> 01:05:33,663
Okay.

858
01:05:40,691 --> 01:05:43,187
This dress is fucking hideous.

859
01:05:44,746 --> 01:05:46,748
Take it off.

860
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,762
Take your dress off.

861
01:05:51,711 --> 01:05:54,103
Get up there
and fucking cut it off her.

862
01:05:54,745 --> 01:05:56,740
Do it now!

863
01:05:56,820 --> 01:06:00,806
Take her fucking dress off.
Just rip it off her. Hurry up!

864
01:06:00,886 --> 01:06:05,779
- Hurry up! Fucking do it.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

865
01:06:05,859 --> 01:06:07,861
Do it.

866
01:06:10,728 --> 01:06:13,328
Yeah. Beautiful.

867
01:06:28,838 --> 01:06:31,334
You wouldn't betray me,
would you?

868
01:06:33,811 --> 01:06:35,785
I was just gonna
go look for the girl.

869
01:06:35,865 --> 01:06:38,429
Oh, no, no, no. I want you to
stay here with me.

870
01:06:38,483 --> 01:06:41,135
I want you to stay here
with me close.

871
01:06:41,745 --> 01:06:44,231
You soothe me, little bird.

872
01:06:58,740 --> 01:07:00,849
Oh, good. You got it.
Did you trace the messages?

873
01:07:00,930 --> 01:07:03,716
You stole evidence
from an active crime scene,

874
01:07:03,796 --> 01:07:07,824
and then had it sent to my office.
Renee, what were you thinking?

875
01:07:07,904 --> 01:07:12,787
Roman is the one that put a price
on the kid's head. Okay? I had to.

876
01:07:12,867 --> 01:07:15,790
- I can't get into it right now...
- Renee, you need help.

877
01:07:15,870 --> 01:07:19,761
- What are you talking about?
- She's right.

878
01:07:20,811 --> 01:07:24,256
You are a good cop, Montoya,
but you've lost your way.

879
01:07:24,930 --> 01:07:26,748
What?

880
01:07:26,828 --> 01:07:29,875
I'm sorry. Okay?
You gave me no choice.

881
01:07:29,955 --> 01:07:32,295
- Did you sell me out?
- I'm sorry.

882
01:07:32,843 --> 01:07:34,845
You're suspended.

883
01:07:35,001 --> 01:07:37,403
Your badge and your gun, now.

884
01:07:41,830 --> 01:07:44,878
<i>If you've ever watched
any cop movie ever,</i>

885
01:07:44,958 --> 01:07:47,755
you know that
this is when shit gets real.

886
01:07:47,835 --> 01:07:53,376
What's the point of the badge,
when it means fuck all anyway?

887
01:07:55,791 --> 01:07:57,702
Right, Captain?

888
01:07:57,782 --> 01:08:01,405
No cop ever gets anything done
until after they've been suspended.

889
01:08:03,871 --> 01:08:08,317
<i>Which would've had me worried,
only I had more pressing concerns.</i>

890
01:08:08,823 --> 01:08:12,289
<i>And that is why you should never
partake in paying federal income taxes.</i>

891
01:08:12,879 --> 01:08:14,881
Hey, you'll ruin your nails.

892
01:08:17,883 --> 01:08:20,921
- Thank you.
- Anyway, lesson 37.

893
01:08:21,001 --> 01:08:23,003
Why...

894
01:08:23,952 --> 01:08:28,771
- You said they wouldn't find us.
- Chillax. No one knows we're here.

895
01:08:28,851 --> 01:08:31,431
Harleen Quinzel,
this is Gotham Police.

896
01:08:31,823 --> 01:08:33,745
Okay. So they know.

897
01:08:33,825 --> 01:08:35,826
Let's scram.

898
01:08:36,994 --> 01:08:39,813
- Open the door.
- Holy back door, Beavy.

899
01:08:39,894 --> 01:08:41,888
This is getting outta hand.
Bruce, come here.

900
01:08:41,968 --> 01:08:43,970
I can hear you!
Open the door.

901
01:08:44,887 --> 01:08:46,871
What is that?

902
01:08:46,951 --> 01:08:49,406
See you in hell, Harley!

903
01:08:51,944 --> 01:08:54,232
Get under the table!

904
01:08:55,906 --> 01:08:57,849
Bruce? Bruce!

905
01:08:57,929 --> 01:08:59,931
Come here! No!

906
01:09:09,867 --> 01:09:11,869
Bruce?

907
01:09:12,901 --> 01:09:15,355
Come here, boy. Bruce?

908
01:09:17,957 --> 01:09:19,959
Bruce?

909
01:09:20,877 --> 01:09:22,879
Bruce?

910
01:09:23,879 --> 01:09:25,842
This doesn't make sense.

911
01:09:25,922 --> 01:09:29,961
It doesn't make sense. I don't
understand. No one knew we were here.

912
01:09:30,041 --> 01:09:32,328
No one knew we were here,
except...

913
01:09:32,929 --> 01:09:35,973
Doc. Oh, my God. Doc?

914
01:09:37,005 --> 01:09:39,407
Doc? Where is he?

915
01:09:40,905 --> 01:09:44,068
Doc?
I can't find Bruce.

916
01:09:44,150 --> 01:09:46,400
I can't find him. I...

917
01:09:52,103 --> 01:09:53,971
No.

918
01:09:54,051 --> 01:09:58,028
- I'm sorry, lotus flower.
- You sold me out?

919
01:09:58,108 --> 01:10:01,438
Too many people offering me
too much money.

920
01:10:02,987 --> 01:10:05,494
I have enough now
to open up a new restaurant.

921
01:10:06,083 --> 01:10:09,830
- A really nice one.
- But, Doc,

922
01:10:09,910 --> 01:10:11,852
it's me.

923
01:10:11,932 --> 01:10:13,934
It's just business.

924
01:10:40,958 --> 01:10:44,351
<i>This next bit
ain't very pretty.</i>

925
01:10:45,035 --> 01:10:47,092
- You're right.
- Harley?

926
01:10:47,172 --> 01:10:49,345
He's right.

927
01:10:51,029 --> 01:10:53,031
Business is business.

928
01:10:53,939 --> 01:10:55,941
I've got the kid.

929
01:10:56,045 --> 01:10:58,967
But I'm gonna need to renegotiate
the terms of our deal.

930
01:10:59,048 --> 01:11:03,085
If I hand her over, I want everyone
who's after me to back off.

931
01:11:03,165 --> 01:11:06,912
<i>Quinn,
bring me the rock now</i>

932
01:11:06,992 --> 01:11:08,913
and I guarantee your safety.

933
01:11:08,993 --> 01:11:12,093
I own this town.
You'll have my protection.

934
01:11:12,173 --> 01:11:14,002
Fine.

935
01:11:14,082 --> 01:11:18,517
Meet me at Amusement Mile.
The Booby Trap. In one hour.

936
01:11:28,063 --> 01:11:30,064
Quit judging.

937
01:11:32,191 --> 01:11:34,193
Zsasz!

938
01:11:40,167 --> 01:11:44,060
Come on, kid.
Let's get you somewhere safe.

939
01:11:44,140 --> 01:11:46,142
We got them.

940
01:11:49,165 --> 01:11:51,087
Little bird!

941
01:11:51,167 --> 01:11:54,476
You're gonna be
driving Mr. Zsasz tonight.

942
01:11:54,994 --> 01:11:58,574
Go. Fetch. Amusement Mile.
The Booby Trap.

943
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:01,082
Do we have to bring them back?

944
01:12:01,207 --> 01:12:04,631
I think you can manage
a couple of little girls.

945
01:12:06,087 --> 01:12:08,088
Just bring me back my diamond.

946
01:12:55,088 --> 01:12:57,090
What is it?

947
01:12:57,205 --> 01:12:59,207
Nothing.

948
01:13:11,260 --> 01:13:14,140
- Pull over.
- What?

949
01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:17,519
Pull the fucking car over now.

950
01:13:19,225 --> 01:13:21,585
I gotta take a leak.

951
01:13:24,250 --> 01:13:27,152
<i>She betrayed you, boss.
She betrayed you.</i>

952
01:13:27,232 --> 01:13:31,698
- Are you sure?
<i>- Your little bird's a fucking rat.</i>

953
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:41,520
You want me to kill her?

954
01:13:44,958 --> 01:13:47,608
No. No. No.

955
01:13:48,105 --> 01:13:50,107
I'll come to you.

956
01:14:25,263 --> 01:14:27,748
I thought we were friends.
And you...

957
01:14:28,204 --> 01:14:31,240
You saw what it's like for me out there.
I didn't have a choice.

958
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:34,702
And if you go before he gets here,
everything will be fine.

959
01:14:36,304 --> 01:14:38,164
Harley.

960
01:14:38,244 --> 01:14:40,750
I'm sorry, kid. I am.

961
01:14:51,182 --> 01:14:53,184
That was fast.

962
01:14:55,321 --> 01:14:57,160
She's in...

963
01:14:57,240 --> 01:15:01,644
- Where's Cassandra Cain?
- You? Again?

964
01:15:10,334 --> 01:15:13,195
- Are you drunk?
- Come on.

965
01:15:13,275 --> 01:15:15,277
Okay.

966
01:15:36,410 --> 01:15:38,615
Right in the tit.

967
01:15:44,261 --> 01:15:46,642
Where's Cassandra Cain?

968
01:15:47,294 --> 01:15:49,296
Cass.

969
01:15:55,261 --> 01:15:57,777
You killed my sandwich!

970
01:16:05,216 --> 01:16:07,218
Bye-bye, birdie.

971
01:16:07,426 --> 01:16:09,428
Ow!

972
01:16:10,408 --> 01:16:12,268
No fair.

973
01:16:12,348 --> 01:16:16,344
- Was that really necessary?
- You don't know her like I do.

974
01:16:16,424 --> 01:16:18,426
Cass?

975
01:16:22,089 --> 01:16:25,320
Oh, thank God.
I'm gonna get you outta here.

976
01:16:25,401 --> 01:16:29,269
Did she really tape you
to a damn toilet?

977
01:16:30,353 --> 01:16:31,316
Hmm.

978
01:16:31,396 --> 01:16:33,662
This is nice.

979
01:16:34,273 --> 01:16:36,275
You're still conscious.

980
01:16:38,256 --> 01:16:42,754
You can still feel? Look at me.
Are you a good girl, now?

981
01:16:44,292 --> 01:16:48,728
"I'm a good girl.
I'm a good girl."

982
01:16:59,379 --> 01:17:03,240
I got one
for all the little birds

983
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:06,797
I helped fly away
from this world.

984
01:17:07,272 --> 01:17:09,809
I'm saving
a special spot for you.

985
01:17:11,286 --> 01:17:13,287
Right here.

986
01:17:17,416 --> 01:17:19,432
- You're gonna have to be quiet.
- Hi.

987
01:17:19,512 --> 01:17:21,747
What are you guys doing?

988
01:17:25,402 --> 01:17:28,325
Oh, I know
where the diamond is.

989
01:17:28,405 --> 01:17:31,798
Is that rock still inside you?

990
01:17:34,410 --> 01:17:36,412
Oh, God.

991
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:41,322
Stop.

992
01:17:42,417 --> 01:17:45,455
- The hell, Zsasz?
- Cut her open.

993
01:17:45,535 --> 01:17:48,437
- Stop fucking around.
- You heard me.

994
01:17:48,517 --> 01:17:50,742
Cut her fucking open.

995
01:17:51,384 --> 01:17:53,943
Okay. No, no. No, no, no.
See, she's just a kid.

996
01:17:54,407 --> 01:17:57,476
- You're a filthy fucking rat.
- I'm a rat?

997
01:17:57,556 --> 01:18:01,479
I knew you couldn't be
trusted. Roman's little bird.

998
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:03,879
You little fucking bird.

999
01:18:04,458 --> 01:18:06,943
That's why he needs me
to look out for him.

1000
01:18:08,556 --> 01:18:11,938
That's why he needs me
to take care of him.

1001
01:18:13,518 --> 01:18:16,431
You know you're just
being paranoid, Zsasz.

1002
01:18:16,511 --> 01:18:18,275
- Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

1003
01:18:18,356 --> 01:18:20,357
Prove it to me.

1004
01:18:20,472 --> 01:18:22,948
Rip open her little tummy.

1005
01:18:23,340 --> 01:18:26,899
- Yeah, that's not gonna happen.
- Now! Rip it open!

1006
01:18:40,459 --> 01:18:42,850
You piece of shit!

1007
01:18:50,551 --> 01:18:52,553
Freeze!

1008
01:18:55,577 --> 01:18:57,802
Don't fucking move.

1009
01:18:59,528 --> 01:19:01,815
Who the fuck are you?

1010
01:19:08,473 --> 01:19:11,334
- Go get the kid.
- All right.

1011
01:19:11,414 --> 01:19:13,378
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Back the fuck up!

1012
01:19:13,458 --> 01:19:15,463
- Get away from me. All of you.
- Put that shit down.

1013
01:19:15,543 --> 01:19:17,997
Shoot them, kid.

1014
01:19:18,389 --> 01:19:21,541
You, put that stupid-ass
Robin Hood piece of shit down!

1015
01:19:21,621 --> 01:19:24,523
- Cass, it's okay. Just calm...
- Don't move!

1016
01:19:24,603 --> 01:19:26,504
Okay.

1017
01:19:26,584 --> 01:19:28,557
I don't know
what the fuck is going on.

1018
01:19:29,310 --> 01:19:34,445
But I know that this shit stick...
just tried to gut me.

1019
01:19:34,633 --> 01:19:36,635
And you.

1020
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:40,482
Thought you were different.

1021
01:19:42,598 --> 01:19:44,813
I'm sorry, kid.

1022
01:19:46,580 --> 01:19:49,848
I'm just a terrible person,
I guess.

1023
01:19:56,443 --> 01:19:58,345
Ooh!

1024
01:19:58,425 --> 01:19:59,471
Ooh, I'm back.

1025
01:19:59,551 --> 01:20:02,578
Okay, I feel like I've just walked in on
something I don't give two shits about.

1026
01:20:02,658 --> 01:20:05,413
This guy's dead, so I'm just
gonna get outta your hair. Cool?

1027
01:20:05,493 --> 01:20:08,458
No. Wait. She's lying.
She works for Sionis.

1028
01:20:08,538 --> 01:20:10,919
Excuse me? I work for Sionis?

1029
01:20:12,448 --> 01:20:14,558
I'm not letting you
sell the kid to him.

1030
01:20:14,638 --> 01:20:17,601
I wasn't going to sell the kid.
I was going to trade the kid.

1031
01:20:17,681 --> 01:20:19,562
Yeah. To save
your own stupid skin. Huh?

1032
01:20:19,642 --> 01:20:22,585
I'm not proud of what I did,
but I had half the city after me.

1033
01:20:22,665 --> 01:20:26,515
- Even the fucking Crossbow Killer.
- I'm not the Crossbow Killer!

1034
01:20:26,595 --> 01:20:28,597
Whoa.

1035
01:20:29,578 --> 01:20:32,438
They call me...
Helena Bertinelli.

1036
01:20:32,518 --> 01:20:35,523
For fuck's sake.
As in the Bertinelli massacre?

1037
01:20:35,603 --> 01:20:39,945
Sheesh kebab. That is
childhood trauma, right there.

1038
01:20:45,519 --> 01:20:47,521
<i>I killed Galante.</i>

1039
01:20:51,473 --> 01:20:53,474
I killed his firing squad.

1040
01:20:57,613 --> 01:21:00,078
I killed Victor Zsasz.

1041
01:21:05,683 --> 01:21:07,960
And now I'm done.

1042
01:21:09,509 --> 01:21:11,510
Bravo.

1043
01:21:15,619 --> 01:21:17,489
So if you don't mind,
I'm gonna leave now.

1044
01:21:17,569 --> 01:21:19,571
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1045
01:21:19,696 --> 01:21:23,525
I hate to be the one to break it to
you, sweetheart, but you are not done.

1046
01:21:23,605 --> 01:21:26,517
Who do you think funded
Galante's little power grab, huh?

1047
01:21:26,597 --> 01:21:28,457
Galante was working with Sionis.

1048
01:21:28,537 --> 01:21:30,584
Roman killed your whole family
looking for that rock.

1049
01:21:30,664 --> 01:21:33,097
You don't think
he's gonna kill this kid?

1050
01:21:33,635 --> 01:21:36,474
That diamond is our
only chance of stopping him.

1051
01:21:36,554 --> 01:21:40,082
You guys.
Hey, I think you should see this.

1052
01:21:42,403 --> 01:21:43,356
Oh.

1053
01:21:43,436 --> 01:21:45,733
It's Sionis.

1054
01:21:57,449 --> 01:21:59,757
We're fucked.

1055
01:22:00,284 --> 01:22:02,286
He bought himself an army.

1056
01:22:10,460 --> 01:22:12,462
They're all here for me.

1057
01:22:13,515 --> 01:22:15,771
Aren't they?

1058
01:22:22,325 --> 01:22:24,245
- No.
- They're not?

1059
01:22:24,308 --> 01:22:26,211
No, they're not.

1060
01:22:26,359 --> 01:22:29,344
Do you know what that means? That means
he's not just after the kid anymore.

1061
01:22:29,424 --> 01:22:33,473
He's after all of us. He's sure as hell
after me. I just robbed him.

1062
01:22:33,553 --> 01:22:36,946
You just betrayed him.
You just killed his BFF.

1063
01:22:37,338 --> 01:22:40,427
And you're dumb enough
to be building a case against him.

1064
01:22:40,507 --> 01:22:44,012
So, unless we all wanna
die very unpleasant deaths

1065
01:22:44,093 --> 01:22:47,378
and let Roman go finger-fishing
in the kid's intestinal tract,

1066
01:22:48,410 --> 01:22:52,313
- we're gonna have to work together.
- With you?

1067
01:22:52,393 --> 01:22:55,253
Yeah.
We're gonna work together,

1068
01:22:55,333 --> 01:22:57,335
and we'll get outta here
in one piece, okay?

1069
01:23:00,567 --> 01:23:02,750
Okay.

1070
01:23:03,393 --> 01:23:05,868
Yeah. Okay.

1071
01:23:08,439 --> 01:23:11,310
- Sure.
- Yes!

1072
01:23:11,390 --> 01:23:15,445
But we are gonna need
some serious hardware.

1073
01:23:18,426 --> 01:23:20,953
Will this do?

1074
01:23:22,652 --> 01:23:25,657
No. Not at all.

1075
01:23:27,413 --> 01:23:29,877
We're dead.
We're fucking dead.

1076
01:23:29,932 --> 01:23:33,463
That slimy jizznozzle! I can't believe
he took it all! - We're fucked.

1077
01:23:33,544 --> 01:23:35,988
- Fuck!
- Uh, there's this.

1078
01:23:42,458 --> 01:23:44,459
Okay.

1079
01:23:55,407 --> 01:23:59,925
Friends, brothers,
men of Gotham.

1080
01:24:00,610 --> 01:24:04,941
I have funded you.
I've protected you.

1081
01:24:05,530 --> 01:24:09,017
I've scratched your backs
and kept you outta jail.

1082
01:24:09,545 --> 01:24:12,802
Well, now it's time
to say thank you.

1083
01:24:13,537 --> 01:24:19,046
Go show those little bitches
you don't mess with Roman Sionis.

1084
01:24:19,543 --> 01:24:23,030
Half a mil to whoever
brings me the girl alive.

1085
01:24:23,421 --> 01:24:25,834
The rest you can kill.

1086
01:24:31,470 --> 01:24:33,472
Dope.

1087
01:24:34,473 --> 01:24:38,032
Oh, no, no, no. Not that one.
Sentimental value. Try this.

1088
01:24:40,468 --> 01:24:43,088
- You're kidding.
- What? Gotta take care of the girls.

1089
01:24:43,138 --> 01:24:45,403
Isn't this fun?
It's just like a sleepover.

1090
01:24:45,483 --> 01:24:47,509
We should order pizza.
Make cosmos.

1091
01:24:47,589 --> 01:24:49,960
- Harley, focus. Yeah.
- Okay.

1092
01:24:50,655 --> 01:24:53,504
Hey, nice. What the hell is up
with this bow and arrow shtick?

1093
01:24:53,584 --> 01:24:57,248
It's not a fucking bow and arrow.
It's a crossbow. I'm not 12.

1094
01:24:57,297 --> 01:25:00,426
- Love this chick. She's got rage issues.
- I don't have rage issues.

1095
01:25:00,506 --> 01:25:03,076
You know,
psychologically speaking,

1096
01:25:03,468 --> 01:25:05,525
vengeance rarely brings
the catharsis we hope for.

1097
01:25:05,605 --> 01:25:06,557
Yeah.

1098
01:25:06,637 --> 01:25:09,947
Are we ready?
Bad guys, just outside.

1099
01:25:13,643 --> 01:25:15,879
Shit. Get down.

1100
01:25:16,678 --> 01:25:18,871
Down here!

1101
01:25:19,691 --> 01:25:21,404
Cass!

1102
01:25:21,484 --> 01:25:23,489
- Follow me!
- Go, go, go, go!

1103
01:25:23,569 --> 01:25:25,571
Go!

1104
01:25:29,512 --> 01:25:31,514
Holy shit!

1105
01:25:51,636 --> 01:25:53,422
What?

1106
01:25:53,502 --> 01:25:55,466
You are so cool.

1107
01:25:55,546 --> 01:25:57,547
Okay. This way.

1108
01:26:05,628 --> 01:26:07,629
Get ready, ladies.

1109
01:26:17,721 --> 01:26:20,603
Don't worry. You're gonna make it.
Okay? Okay.

1110
01:26:20,683 --> 01:26:23,678
What the... Go! Go, go, go!

1111
01:26:23,758 --> 01:26:25,760
Fuck.

1112
01:26:27,616 --> 01:26:29,618
Shit.

1113
01:26:38,615 --> 01:26:40,617
Whoa. Shit!

1114
01:26:59,582 --> 01:27:01,584
Motherfucker.

1115
01:27:13,741 --> 01:27:15,693
Let me go!

1116
01:27:15,773 --> 01:27:18,050
Gotcha.

1117
01:27:18,703 --> 01:27:19,666
This way!

1118
01:27:19,746 --> 01:27:21,595
Come on. Come on. It's okay.
Come on.

1119
01:27:21,675 --> 01:27:23,617
You shouldn't
have to see this.

1120
01:27:23,697 --> 01:27:26,589
Here, hold on to this for me, okay?
That's all you think about.

1121
01:27:26,669 --> 01:27:28,671
Just close your eyes
and hold it tight. Okay?

1122
01:27:29,620 --> 01:27:32,053
Here. Get down. Come on.
You'll be safe.

1123
01:28:13,731 --> 01:28:15,733
Canary!

1124
01:28:16,641 --> 01:28:18,552
You okay?

1125
01:28:18,632 --> 01:28:20,633
We gotta go this way!

1126
01:28:21,863 --> 01:28:23,629
Ugh. More?

1127
01:28:23,709 --> 01:28:26,273
When the fuck did she have
time to do a shoe change?

1128
01:28:26,293 --> 01:28:27,955
Come on.

1129
01:28:33,812 --> 01:28:35,814
Thanks.

1130
01:28:48,722 --> 01:28:50,723
Duck!

1131
01:28:53,819 --> 01:28:55,814
- Hair tie?
- Yeah.

1132
01:28:55,894 --> 01:28:58,067
Ah, fuck!

1133
01:29:02,702 --> 01:29:04,704
I got him!

1134
01:29:06,873 --> 01:29:08,875
Get back here, kid!

1135
01:29:11,908 --> 01:29:14,123
Who's got the kid?

1136
01:29:26,682 --> 01:29:28,684
Get down!

1137
01:29:37,817 --> 01:29:41,126
Please, no more.

1138
01:29:45,677 --> 01:29:48,785
- So, forgive me yet?
- Get off me!

1139
01:29:52,779 --> 01:29:54,815
Anyone else hungry?
I know a great taco spot.

1140
01:29:54,895 --> 01:29:56,629
- I'm starving.
- I love tacos.

1141
01:29:56,709 --> 01:29:58,711
Really?

1142
01:30:05,874 --> 01:30:07,733
Down! Get down!

1143
01:30:07,813 --> 01:30:09,682
You're okay.
You're okay.

1144
01:30:09,762 --> 01:30:12,227
Just breathe. Just breathe.
Let me check it.

1145
01:30:14,725 --> 01:30:16,813
- Get off!
- I got you.

1146
01:30:16,893 --> 01:30:18,690
Ooh!

1147
01:30:18,770 --> 01:30:21,339
Aren't you glad you wore that?
Sexy and bulletproof.

1148
01:30:21,732 --> 01:30:23,893
Harley! No! Get off me!

1149
01:30:23,973 --> 01:30:26,884
- Harley!
- They got the kid. Shit!

1150
01:30:26,964 --> 01:30:31,149
We can't let them get her.
I trust you.

1151
01:30:31,813 --> 01:30:34,003
- One bullet?
- Please help me!

1152
01:30:34,036 --> 01:30:37,197
- Has anyone got any bullets?
- Fuck! I'm out.

1153
01:30:37,786 --> 01:30:40,261
I can't get out there.
I just need to get through.

1154
01:30:40,789 --> 01:30:44,681
- We gotta go. We gotta move.
- Guys, they're in the car.

1155
01:30:44,761 --> 01:30:48,195
- They're getting away.
- Get in there! -Get off!

1156
01:30:49,933 --> 01:30:51,907
Shit! I'm out.

1157
01:30:51,987 --> 01:30:54,233
Guys, come on.
They're closing in.

1158
01:30:54,999 --> 01:30:58,340
Canary, you know
what you have to do!

1159
01:30:58,858 --> 01:31:02,177
Cover your ears!
You better get her back.

1160
01:31:21,858 --> 01:31:24,291
<i>Told ya she had
a killer voice.</i>

1161
01:31:45,013 --> 01:31:47,015
Need a ride?

1162
01:32:12,037 --> 01:32:14,039
Get her!

1163
01:32:44,097 --> 01:32:46,437
Oh!

1164
01:32:56,974 --> 01:32:58,978
- Whip me!
- What?

1165
01:32:59,058 --> 01:33:01,060
- Whip me!
- Okay.

1166
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:12,022
- Kid!
- Harley!

1167
01:33:12,102 --> 01:33:14,104
Shoot her!

1168
01:33:22,006 --> 01:33:25,357
- Harley!
- Hit the brakes!

1169
01:33:44,922 --> 01:33:46,924
No!

1170
01:33:59,102 --> 01:34:01,104
Uh-oh.

1171
01:34:27,158 --> 01:34:29,160
Kid!

1172
01:34:40,994 --> 01:34:42,995
Harley!

1173
01:35:00,073 --> 01:35:03,005
Well, we always did share
a love of the dramatic.

1174
01:35:03,085 --> 01:35:05,087
Didn't we?

1175
01:35:06,193 --> 01:35:08,490
And look at us now.

1176
01:35:09,258 --> 01:35:12,076
But don't you see?
You're trying to kill me.

1177
01:35:12,157 --> 01:35:14,632
I'm the only one
who can protect you!

1178
01:35:17,234 --> 01:35:20,011
You know you can't
stand on your own, Quinn.

1179
01:35:20,091 --> 01:35:22,092
You're not the type!

1180
01:35:22,249 --> 01:35:25,590
But me? You need me!

1181
01:35:40,161 --> 01:35:43,533
Here's the thing, Romy baby.

1182
01:35:45,165 --> 01:35:49,183
Your protection is based on the fact
that people are scared of you.

1183
01:35:49,263 --> 01:35:51,634
Just like
they're scared of Mr. J.

1184
01:35:57,134 --> 01:35:59,641
But I'm the one
they should be scared of.

1185
01:36:00,084 --> 01:36:02,163
Not you, and not Mr. J.

1186
01:36:02,243 --> 01:36:05,625
'Cause
I'm Harley fucking Quinn.

1187
01:36:13,169 --> 01:36:15,171
Shit.

1188
01:36:16,110 --> 01:36:19,178
- That was super embarrassing.
- Hmm. Sure was.

1189
01:36:19,259 --> 01:36:23,537
You think you can beat me?
You're a fucking moron.

1190
01:36:24,304 --> 01:36:26,602
I'm sorry, kid.

1191
01:36:27,141 --> 01:36:30,616
And I'm sorry I tried to sell you.
That was a dick move.

1192
01:36:32,155 --> 01:36:34,157
For what it's worth,

1193
01:36:35,127 --> 01:36:38,603
you made me want to be
a less terrible person.

1194
01:36:39,244 --> 01:36:40,207
Ew.

1195
01:36:40,287 --> 01:36:44,086
If we're apologizing for shit,
I should tell you something.

1196
01:36:44,166 --> 01:36:48,079
- Excuse me!
- I stole something from you.

1197
01:36:48,159 --> 01:36:51,248
- You slippery-fingered little turd.
- I took your ring.

1198
01:36:51,328 --> 01:36:53,522
My ring?

1199
01:36:55,332 --> 01:36:57,334
Dope.

1200
01:37:17,143 --> 01:37:19,971
- Cass! Harley!
- We're okay.

1201
01:37:24,160 --> 01:37:26,161
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1202
01:37:26,266 --> 01:37:28,578
- He's gone?
- Mmm-hmm.

1203
01:37:28,587 --> 01:37:32,588
- Good. Fuck that guy.
- Yeah. Tacos?

1204
01:37:33,830 --> 01:37:36,288
No, but seriously.
You were very impressive with that bow.

1205
01:37:36,369 --> 01:37:39,124
- Very impressive.
- It's a crossbow.

1206
01:37:39,204 --> 01:37:41,292
- I appreciate that. Thank you.
- Morning margaritas!

1207
01:37:41,372 --> 01:37:43,096
Thank you. I got you.

1208
01:37:43,176 --> 01:37:46,150
- You drink, right, kid?
- I don't think so.

1209
01:37:46,230 --> 01:37:48,283
And I love that fucking
name, Huntress.

1210
01:37:48,308 --> 01:37:49,334
- Really?
- Yeah.

1211
01:37:49,390 --> 01:37:52,261
- Oh, great name.
- Wow.

1212
01:37:52,341 --> 01:37:55,158
Um... I really like
how you were able

1213
01:37:55,238 --> 01:37:57,713
to kick so high
in those tight pants.

1214
01:37:57,776 --> 01:38:00,288
- Yeah, that is cool.
- Thanks.

1215
01:38:00,368 --> 01:38:03,594
Thanks for the car.

1216
01:38:04,341 --> 01:38:06,210
You're welcome.

1217
01:38:06,290 --> 01:38:10,642
Kid, if that burrito doesn't
make you shit, I don't know what will.

1218
01:38:12,234 --> 01:38:14,235
Give me a minute.

1219
01:38:14,423 --> 01:38:16,167
Yes!

1220
01:38:16,247 --> 01:38:18,597
Right.

1221
01:38:19,985 --> 01:38:22,150
I've given her prune juice,
laxatives.

1222
01:38:22,156 --> 01:38:24,241
I mean, the kid's got
a stomach made of steel.

1223
01:38:24,292 --> 01:38:26,363
And you know what?
I owe you an apology.

1224
01:38:26,443 --> 01:38:28,324
Me?

1225
01:38:29,102 --> 01:38:31,848
I underestimated you.
And I'm sorry.

1226
01:38:33,677 --> 01:38:35,679
I'm used to it.

1227
01:38:35,762 --> 01:38:39,082
Uh, Harley!
Bring the colander.

1228
01:38:40,703 --> 01:38:44,054
- Ladies.
- Have fun with that.

1229
01:38:44,749 --> 01:38:47,162
So, what now?

1230
01:38:47,699 --> 01:38:50,726
Sionis is gone, but it's just a matter
of time before some other asshole

1231
01:38:50,806 --> 01:38:53,604
- tries to finish what he started.
- Right.

1232
01:38:53,684 --> 01:38:57,025
We gotta clean this city
from the inside out.

1233
01:38:57,646 --> 01:39:00,725
Does she always talk like the cop in
a bad '80s movie, or is that just me?

1234
01:39:00,805 --> 01:39:03,655
- Fuck you. And fuck you.
- What?

1235
01:39:03,735 --> 01:39:07,585
- I mean, we were amazing there.
- Yeah! Hell yeah!

1236
01:39:07,665 --> 01:39:10,630
I agree completely.
So I'll do that, as well.

1237
01:39:10,710 --> 01:39:12,705
- Thank you.
- Right.

1238
01:39:12,785 --> 01:39:14,787
Whoa. Whoa, whoa!

1239
01:39:16,746 --> 01:39:19,811
- She stole my fucking car!
- What?

1240
01:39:22,856 --> 01:39:25,649
- I'm sorry.
<i>- I know what you're thinking.</i>

1241
01:39:25,709 --> 01:39:28,604
You think I'm a dick
after all that.

1242
01:39:28,684 --> 01:39:31,763
But you heard what the cop
said. Sionis is gone.

1243
01:39:31,843 --> 01:39:37,196
And those guys?
They're gonna be just fine.

1244
01:39:37,796 --> 01:39:41,585
<i>Montoya's boss picked up
the gangbangers at the Booby Trap.</i>

1245
01:39:41,665 --> 01:39:44,608
<i>And took all the credit
while he was at it.</i>

1246
01:39:44,688 --> 01:39:46,690
<i>Again.</i>

1247
01:39:51,674 --> 01:39:54,742
<i>It was the kick in the balls she needed
to see that she had nothing to prove</i>

1248
01:39:54,822 --> 01:39:57,119
<i>to those blowhard assholes.</i>

1249
01:39:57,710 --> 01:40:00,112
<i>She quit the same day.</i>

1250
01:40:04,726 --> 01:40:06,711
<i>We got the secret bank codes
off the diamond.</i>

1251
01:40:06,791 --> 01:40:09,266
<i>And Huntress
got her family money back.</i>

1252
01:40:10,712 --> 01:40:13,797
<i>She's using it to fund
a little crime-fighting outfit.</i>

1253
01:40:16,685 --> 01:40:20,099
<i>They call themselves
the Birds of Prey.</i>

1254
01:40:20,741 --> 01:40:23,320
<i>I call them
dorky little do-gooders.</i>

1255
01:40:25,850 --> 01:40:29,836
<i>The rock itself was worth a
chunk of change, so I pawned it.</i>

1256
01:40:29,916 --> 01:40:32,630
<i>And I invested the cash
in a little startup</i>

1257
01:40:32,710 --> 01:40:34,712
<i>making waves in the East End.</i>

1258
01:40:37,871 --> 01:40:39,793
<i>Oh! And I found Bruce.</i>

1259
01:40:39,873 --> 01:40:42,659
<i>He was wandering
around Chinatown.</i>

1260
01:40:42,739 --> 01:40:46,257
<i>I guess it proves the theory that
hyenas really do have nine lives.</i>

1261
01:41:06,814 --> 01:41:10,175
<i>Yeah, yeah.
I made the kid my apprentice.</i>

1262
01:41:10,723 --> 01:41:12,725
<i>Call me a softy.</i>

1263
01:41:13,726 --> 01:41:15,728
I dare ya.
