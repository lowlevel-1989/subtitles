1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
_

2
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:30,450
Come in.

3
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:35,756
- What is it, Poole?
- It's 2:45, sir...

4
00:01:35,828 --> 00:01:38,490
and your address at the University
is at 3:00.

5
00:01:38,564 --> 00:01:40,156
So it is, Poole.

6
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:47,597
- You know, Poole? You're a nuisance.
- Yes, sir.

7
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:50,074
But I don't know what I should do
without you.

8
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:51,167
Thank you, sir.

9
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:55,112
Your sense of duty
is as impregnable as Gibraltar.

10
00:01:55,214 --> 00:01:59,116
- Even Bach can't move it.
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

11
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:01,551
I'm afraid you'll be late, sir.

12
00:02:01,754 --> 00:02:04,120
I see you want to get rid of me.

13
00:02:05,124 --> 00:02:06,785
All right, Poole.

14
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:18,263
They're lovely roses, Poole.

15
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:20,797
Thank you, sir.

16
00:02:31,617 --> 00:02:35,348
- Will you wear your overcoat or cape, sir?
- Give me my cape.

17
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:21,026
- Good afternoon, Jasper.
- Good afternoon, sir.

18
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:24,092
- Nice day, isn't it?
- Isn't it, sir?

19
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,104
- St. Simon's.
- Yes, sir.

20
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,419
Constable.

21
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:46,985
- How are you, sir?
- Very good. Thank you, sir.

22
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:52,154
I won't need you anymore today, Jasper.

23
00:03:52,231 --> 00:03:54,495
Dr. Lanyon will take me
where I'm going later.

24
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:55,829
Yes, sir.

25
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,564
- How do you do, Dr. Jekyll?
- How do you do?

26
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,441
- Hello, Hampton.
- Afternoon, sir.

27
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:13,683
The auditorium's full, sir.
It always is when you speak, sir.

28
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,517
Flattery!

29
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:39,811
- I hope Jekyll's in form today.
- He's always in form.

30
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,938
The old codgers are in for another jolt.

31
00:04:42,014 --> 00:04:45,506
I'd wager your friend has something
up his sleeve again, Dr. Lanyon.

32
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:49,043
Jekyll is always sensational,
always indulging in spectacular theories.

33
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,111
Gentlemen...

34
00:04:51,657 --> 00:04:53,386
London is so full of fog...

35
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,955
that it has penetrated our minds...

36
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,589
set boundaries for our vision.

37
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:03,358
As men of science, we should be curious...

38
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,664
and bold enough to peer beyond it...

39
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:08,204
into the many wonders it conceals.

40
00:05:08,774 --> 00:05:11,766
I shall not dwell today
on the secrets of the human body...

41
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:13,607
in sickness and in health.

42
00:05:14,046 --> 00:05:16,606
Today, I want to talk to you
of a greater marvel:

43
00:05:16,682 --> 00:05:18,445
The soul of man.

44
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:24,314
My analysis of this soul,
the human psyche...

45
00:05:25,057 --> 00:05:28,254
leads me to believe
that man is not truly one...

46
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:30,558
but truly two.

47
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:35,160
One of him strives for the nobilities of life.

48
00:05:35,701 --> 00:05:37,794
This we call his good self.

49
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:41,703
The other
seeks an expression of impulses...

50
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:45,437
that bind him to some dim animal relation
with the earth.

51
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:48,737
This, we may call the bad.

52
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:53,774
These two carry out an eternal struggle
in the nature of man...

53
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:56,011
yet they are chained together.

54
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:59,220
And that chain spells
repression to the evil.

55
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:01,055
Remorse to the good.

56
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:05,923
Now, if these two selves
could be separated from each other...

57
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:09,095
how much freer the good in us would be.

58
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:11,362
What heights it might scale.

59
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:14,873
And the so-called evil, once liberated...

60
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:18,274
would fulfill itself and trouble us no more.

61
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:21,469
I believe the day is not far off...

62
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:24,246
when this separation will be possible.

63
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:26,917
In my experiments, I have found...

64
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:29,784
that certain chemicals have the power...

65
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:36,420
Tell me, he can split me in two
like a jolly amoeba.

66
00:06:36,495 --> 00:06:39,726
- By Jove, it's marvelous.
- I confess it's too much for me.

67
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:42,996
Why don't you stay at home
and send your other self to the lecture?

68
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,867
To divide a human being in two?
Ridiculous!

69
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:48,031
I'm going to try to analyze my psyche.

70
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:52,100
- I didn't expect you to agree with me.
- Agree with you? You talk like a lunatic.

71
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:54,112
But I hope
you're sane enough to remember...

72
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,910
that we have a consultation
at the Duchess of Densmore's.

73
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:58,280
- I'm not going.
- What?

74
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:01,912
Please give the duchess my compliments
and some castor oil.

75
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:06,616
I saw her yesterday. She's a bit bilious,
more in spirit than in body, I'm afraid.

76
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:09,786
- I'm going along the free wards.
- My dear fellow, be reasonable.

77
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:12,956
You know how insistent the duchess was
on your coming.

78
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:15,262
You can't neglect her
for a lot of charity cases.

79
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:16,323
Can't I?

80
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:19,070
It's the things one can't do
that always tempt me.

81
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:20,571
Just as you like.

82
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,609
But you'll remember we're having dinner
at the Carews' tonight.

83
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:26,577
- I'll pick you up later.
- Thanks. You'll find me in the wards.

84
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:27,738
See you at 9:00.

85
00:07:30,182 --> 00:07:32,742
Mary, what are you doing
with those crutches?

86
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:35,910
I can't do without them, sir.

87
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:38,047
Yes, you can do without them, Mary.

88
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:41,958
I told you yesterday.
Believe me, I can't do anything for you.

89
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:46,057
I believe you, sir...

90
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,566
but I can't walk without them, sir.

91
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,829
Yes, you can. Give them to me.

92
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,062
Don't be afraid.

93
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:57,271
Now walk, Mary. Come on. Come to me.

94
00:07:57,476 --> 00:07:58,773
Yes, sir.

95
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:03,980
Walk, Mary. Come on.

96
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:10,219
All right, sir. I can walk, sir.

97
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:13,258
- Of course you can.
- I can walk, sir!

98
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:29,468
There, there, Mrs. Lucas.

99
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:34,170
- It hurts, doesn't it?
- Yes, sir.

100
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,645
Sometimes a doctor must hurt you a little
to make you well.

101
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:38,775
Yes, sir.

102
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,445
And if a doctor thinks
a slight operation is necessary...

103
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,249
there's no need to be afraid, is there?

104
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:46,120
- No, sir.
- I want you to know it's going to cure you.

105
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,887
I believe you, sir.

106
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:51,260
Jekyll, we haven't much time, you know.

107
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:53,758
I'm sorry.
I'm afraid I must miss the dinner.

108
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,528
I'll come afterwards for the dancing.

109
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:58,536
- What's keeping you?
- I must operate on this patient at once.

110
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:01,038
Why not leave it
to one of the house surgeons?

111
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:02,506
They're quite competent.

112
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:05,237
Perhaps, but I prefer to do it myself.

113
00:09:05,911 --> 00:09:08,903
Will you make my excuses
to General Carew and Muriel, please?

114
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:10,141
As you like.

115
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:13,079
Lanyon, you make my excuses
to the General...

116
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:15,514
and I'll make mine to Muriel myself.

117
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:16,777
All right.

118
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:17,948
Yes, Miss Muriel.

119
00:09:18,023 --> 00:09:20,150
Will it be almond cakes
with coffee, Hobson?

120
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:23,559
- I'm sorry, miss. I don't think so.
- But we must have almond cakes.

121
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:25,722
- Send for them immediately.
- Very good, miss.

122
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:29,666
- What's this about almond cakes?
- Dr. Jekyll likes them, Father.

123
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,896
You know you'll spoil that fiancÃ© of yours.

124
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:34,371
- I like spoiling him.
- So I observe.

125
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,871
And what about your father?

126
00:09:35,941 --> 00:09:38,375
You're already the most spoiled darling
in the world.

127
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:39,843
Dr. Lanyon.

128
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:42,012
Lanyon. Delighted to see you.

129
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,242
Punctual for dinner,
punctual in everything.

130
00:09:44,316 --> 00:09:45,305
How do you do, sir?

131
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:47,648
- What an astonishing motto.
- How do you do?

132
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,120
- Where's Jekyll?
- He stayed to perform an operation.

133
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:52,214
- Isn't he coming?
- He will be in after dinner.

134
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,918
He asked me to make his excuses.

135
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:56,553
I hope the patient is worthy
of Jekyll's attention.

136
00:09:56,629 --> 00:10:00,030
- A woman in the free wards.
- Free ward.

137
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,300
Jekyll gives entirely too much time
to his charity patients.

138
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:04,563
I love him for that.

139
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:07,470
Nonsense, my dear.
He ought to come down to earth.

140
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,407
- Mr. Utterson.
- Utterson.

141
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,106
However, I promised Harry the first waltz.

142
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,546
If he's late, I shall be furious with him.

143
00:10:16,615 --> 00:10:17,946
No.

144
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:35,462
You know, I'm very glad Jekyll is late.

145
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:39,162
I'm obliged to him
for a most delightful waltz.

146
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,811
Thank you.

147
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:53,209
Hello, General.
I'm very sorry to be late, sir.

148
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:57,711
Repentance is a virtue, Jekyll,
but it's better to be punctual.

149
00:10:58,123 --> 00:11:00,387
In 40 years, I've never been late for dinner.

150
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,256
It's indeed a remarkable record, sir.

151
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,796
Merely a matter of training, my boy.
At the age of...

152
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:08,823
General, you've not forgotten
this is our dance?

153
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:11,961
Certainly not, Lady Dakin.
I've been looking forward to it.

154
00:11:12,037 --> 00:11:13,629
See you later, Jekyll.

155
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:14,963
May I?

156
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,837
- I shouldn't.
- But you will.

157
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:22,840
- Was she pretty?
- Ravishing.

158
00:11:23,048 --> 00:11:24,811
- Who?
- Your patient.

159
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:26,943
I was thinking of someone else.

160
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:29,084
Someone to make you late again?

161
00:11:29,154 --> 00:11:31,145
- Are you chiding me?
- Of course.

162
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:34,023
- Because you hate me?
- Of course, silly.

163
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:37,457
Then, will you come into the garden
where I can bear it?

164
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,225
- Certainly not.
- Why not?

165
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:42,998
- Father. He'd be furious.
- It would do him good.

166
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:47,168
He's not looking.
He's teaching Lady Dakin how to waltz.

167
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:57,505
- Can't stay long.
- Just forever.

168
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,517
Not even half as long as that.

169
00:12:09,194 --> 00:12:12,527
Now, my farthing,
chide me, mock me, hate me...

170
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:14,425
but don't send me away.

171
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:17,393
Silly. Are you sorry you were late?

172
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,328
- No.
- You're not?

173
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,340
- If I wasn't late, you wouldn't have pouted.
- I won't forgive...

174
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:25,002
If you hadn't pouted,
you wouldn't have looked so pretty.

175
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,635
Do you talk this way to your patients?

176
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:29,510
If you hadn't looked so pretty,
I might have postponed...

177
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,277
- Pardon me.
- Not another word.

178
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,374
Well?

179
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:37,086
I might have postponed telling you
that I love you so much...

180
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:39,249
and I don't want to wait any longer.

181
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:41,418
I want you to marry me now.

182
00:12:41,493 --> 00:12:44,929
Darling, I want to with all my heart.
You know I do.

183
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:46,931
But Father's so difficult.

184
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:49,092
I don't want to marry your father.

185
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:51,193
I don't mind
having a difficult father-in-law.

186
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,204
You'll be worth it, my darling.

187
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,263
I don't think you love me seriously.

188
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:59,573
I love you better than that.
I love you gaily, happily, high-heartedly.

189
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:02,971
I love you so much
that I could laugh and sing and...

190
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:05,539
I shouldn't spoil it by trying to sing.

191
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:09,754
My darling, I shall persuade your father
to let us marry now.

192
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:11,684
I can't wait any longer.

193
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:15,754
We shall go to Devon for our honeymoon
and live on love and strawberries...

194
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:17,261
and the sight of the sea.

195
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:19,797
- And moonlight.
- Endless moonlight.

196
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,498
I do love you seriously.

197
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:28,103
So seriously that it frightens me.

198
00:13:31,176 --> 00:13:34,339
You've opened a gate for me
into another world.

199
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:37,849
Before that, my work was everything.

200
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:41,010
I was drawn to the mysteries of science,
to the unknown.

201
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:45,348
But now, the unknown wears your face...

202
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:50,293
looks back at me with your eyes.

203
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,865
Darling, I wish this moment
would last forever.

204
00:13:55,934 --> 00:14:00,098
You can make it last, dear. I love you.

205
00:14:00,939 --> 00:14:02,566
Be near me always.

206
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:06,436
Always you and I.

207
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,070
Apart from the world.

208
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,904
I love you, darling.

209
00:14:11,216 --> 00:14:12,444
I love you.

210
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:15,686
Then who shall ever separate us?

211
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,185
- My sweet friend.
- My love.

212
00:14:52,357 --> 00:14:54,587
You ought to wear
squeaky shoes, Hobson.

213
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,127
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

214
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:58,629
The General asks you
to come into the house, miss.

215
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:02,133
- Your guests are inquiring about you.
- Coming, Hobson.

216
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:47,837
- Glad you came.
- Good night, Muriel.

217
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:50,313
- You looked perfectly lovely tonight.
- Thank you.

218
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:52,612
- Good-bye, my dear.
- Good night, General.

219
00:15:52,684 --> 00:15:55,312
I don't know
when I've enjoyed myself so much.

220
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:59,415
- I'll see you at tea tomorrow, dear.
- Yes. I won't forget, Lady Dakin.

221
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:01,186
- Good night.
- Good night.

222
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:04,027
Jekyll, my boy. Waiting to see me?

223
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:06,860
I beg your pardon, sir,
but you would make us very happy...

224
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:09,366
if you'd set an earlier date
for our wedding.

225
00:16:09,434 --> 00:16:10,901
I've already announced to you...

226
00:16:10,969 --> 00:16:13,938
that you would be married
on the anniversary of my own wedding.

227
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:16,634
- That's eight months from now, sir.
- What of it?

228
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,869
We've already been engaged
two months, sir.

229
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:20,104
We see no reason to...

230
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:22,374
I presume I have some rights
in the matter.

231
00:16:22,447 --> 00:16:26,110
- Quite right. That's why we're asking you.
- Why this impatience?

232
00:16:26,451 --> 00:16:28,612
It isn't done.

233
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:31,986
I'm sorry, sir, but I cannot regard that
as a serious objection.

234
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:33,786
Do you hear this, Lanyon?

235
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:37,024
Is this another evidence
of your eccentricity?

236
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:40,288
If it is eccentric to be impatient
in love, sir, I am.

237
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:42,362
This is positively indecent.

238
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:45,096
Father, do you think it fair
to keep us apart for so long?

239
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:49,163
- I waited five years for your mother.
- You have a sturdy temperament, General.

240
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:51,641
Yes, I pride myself on it.

241
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,905
Please don't make me wait that long
for Muriel.

242
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:56,345
Now, my boy, you must leave
these matters to me.

243
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:59,316
There's such a thing
as decent observance, you know.

244
00:16:59,484 --> 00:17:01,884
- Good night.
- Good night, sir.

245
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:04,582
- Good night, Lanyon.
- Good night, sir.

246
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:06,146
<i>Au revoir</i>, my sweet.

247
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:08,582
Come, Lanyon.

248
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,685
- Good night, Muriel.
- Good night.

249
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:21,538
- I'm afraid you offended the General.
- Offended him?

250
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:24,766
It's a pity I didn't strangle the old walrus.

251
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:27,539
Did you hear him? "Wait!"

252
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,973
What the devil does one wait for?

253
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:35,315
I hope the responsibilities of marriage
will sober you up.

254
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:38,217
I'm not marrying to be sober.
I'm marrying to be drunk.

255
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:42,192
- Drunk with love and life and experiments.
- Your experiments are absurd.

256
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:46,220
You have no interest in science at all.
You have no dreams, no curiosities.

257
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:48,789
There are bounds beyond which
one should not go.

258
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:52,735
Yes. It isn't done, I suppose.
I tell you, there are no bounds, Lanyon.

259
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:54,130
Look at that gas lamp.

260
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:56,697
But for some man's curiosity,
we shouldn't have had it.

261
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:58,970
London would still be lighted by linkboys.

262
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:02,207
And wait. One day,
London will glow with incandescence...

263
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:05,216
and will be so beautiful
that even you will be moved by it.

264
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,684
I find London quite satisfactory as it is...

265
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,551
and I'm not interested
in your shortcuts and your byways.

266
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:13,614
But it's in the byways
that the secrets and wonders lie:

267
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:15,387
In science and in life.

268
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,757
Look at the...

269
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:22,658
Fine, you big brute, hit me!
I'll put the police on you!

270
00:18:30,842 --> 00:18:32,571
Are you badly hurt?

271
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:34,470
Where does this girl live?

272
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:36,673
First door on the left
at the top of the stairs.

273
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:38,238
Bring her up here.

274
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:42,684
Make way for the governor.

275
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:44,551
Have you got her, governor?

276
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:48,218
- Right up here?
- Yes. Look out for her head.

277
00:18:49,594 --> 00:18:50,856
Shut up, you lot!

278
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:56,862
What was this all about?

279
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:00,167
- One of Ivy Pearson's callers...
- I can tell you...

280
00:19:00,238 --> 00:19:02,035
Now shut up! One of Ivy...

281
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:06,403
That swine. Hit me, will he?

282
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:09,641
He'll wish he hadn't!

283
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:13,014
I ain't afraid of him, I ain't.
Blast his dirty mug!

284
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,616
He's killed me, that's what he's done.

285
00:19:15,887 --> 00:19:19,618
He's broken me jaw and me knee, too.
I'll get him for this!

286
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:26,458
Look where he kicked me.

287
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,301
It's only a bruise.
It will be quite well in a few days.

288
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:34,931
Either way, you mustn't wear
so tight a garter. It's bad for you.

289
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:38,835
It impedes the circulation.

290
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:44,946
It's awful kind of you to look after me.

291
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,111
Anybody can see now
that you're a real gent, you are.

292
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,883
Now you're the kind
a woman would do something for.

293
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:58,523
- What is it?
- He's hit me here, too, the blighter.

294
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:02,431
He's broken me rib. That's what he's done.
I'm going to faint.

295
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:06,866
You're not seriously hurt.

296
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:10,264
A bit of rest
would do you no harm, though.

297
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,700
You think I ought to go to bed?

298
00:20:13,311 --> 00:20:15,575
I know of no better place for a rest.

299
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,874
All right. You turn your eyes away now.

300
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:23,203
How is the pain now?

301
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,247
I say!

302
00:21:32,023 --> 00:21:33,251
Lanyon.

303
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:35,053
Coming.

304
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:40,989
I'm a doctor, you know,
and I'll call that kiss my fee.

305
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:46,095
Well?

306
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:51,702
Come back soon, won't you?

307
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:54,741
- Sorry. I'm afraid I can't.
- Yes, you can.

308
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:56,139
Soon.

309
00:21:57,516 --> 00:21:59,848
- Good night.
- Come back.

310
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:10,593
<i>Come back soon, won't you?</i>

311
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,295
<i>Yes, you can.</i>

312
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:17,465
<i>Soon, come back...</i>

313
00:22:19,337 --> 00:22:23,671
- I thought your conduct quite disgusting.
- Conduct? Why, a pretty girl kissed me.

314
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:25,369
Should I have called the constable?

315
00:22:25,443 --> 00:22:27,240
- Even suppose I'd liked it.
- What?

316
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:30,304
Yes. That's not a matter of conduct,
but of elementary instinct.

317
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:32,509
You ought to control those instincts.

318
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:35,144
Are you pretending
that you either can or do?

319
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,011
We may control our actions,
but not our impulses.

320
00:22:38,089 --> 00:22:40,922
Perhaps you've forgotten
you're engaged to Muriel.

321
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:42,454
Forgotten it?

322
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:46,153
Can a man dying of thirst forget water?

323
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:51,100
Did you know what would happen
to that thirst if it were denied water?

324
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:54,332
If I understand you correctly,
you sound almost indecent.

325
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,966
What names you give things.

326
00:22:57,042 --> 00:23:00,876
Why aren't you frank enough to admit
that other indecent self in you?

327
00:23:00,946 --> 00:23:03,244
No. You prefer to hide it,
pretend it isn't there.

328
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:06,079
- You have to accept certain things.
- I don't want to accept.

329
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:10,383
I want to be clean, not only in my conduct,
but in my innermost thoughts and desires.

330
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:12,650
- There's only one way to do it.
- How?

331
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:16,525
- Separate the two natures in us.
- That absurd theory of yours.

332
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:20,190
I tell you, it's unscientific
not to admit the possibility of anything.

333
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:21,630
You're mad.

334
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:24,702
Mad, Lanyon? We'll see.

335
00:24:06,811 --> 00:24:08,073
Come in.

336
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:17,847
What is it, Poole?

337
00:24:17,922 --> 00:24:21,949
Begging your pardon for the intrusion, sir,
but did you sleep last night, sir?

338
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:23,255
Don't worry about me.

339
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:27,628
Yes, sir, but you had only a cup of tea
for breakfast for three days. Your health!

340
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:30,998
Now, Poole, you didn't come here
to inquire after my health, did you?

341
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:33,902
One of General Carew's servants
brought this, sir.

342
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:46,411
Miss Muriel is scolding me
for having missed her dinner last night.

343
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:49,214
Go and tell her that I shall come
to dinner tomorrow night.

344
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:50,584
Very good, sir.

345
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:35,015
<i>Marry me now. I cannot wait any longer.</i>

346
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:36,815
<i>Positively indecent.</i>

347
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:38,321
<i>Look where he kicked me.</i>

348
00:27:38,389 --> 00:27:39,879
<i>Your conduct was disgusting.</i>

349
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:42,552
<i>It isn't done!</i>

350
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:45,892
<i>Pity I didn't strangle him. Strangle him!</i>

351
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:47,955
<i>Indecent!</i>

352
00:27:48,032 --> 00:27:51,524
<i>Can a man dying of thirst forget water?</i>

353
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:53,002
<i>Disgusting.</i>

354
00:27:53,137 --> 00:27:54,229
<i>You're mad.</i>

355
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:56,398
<i>Come back soon, won't you?</i>

356
00:27:57,575 --> 00:27:58,974
<i>Come back.</i>

357
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:04,533
Free!

358
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,600
Free at last!

359
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,844
Mad, Lanyon? Carew?

360
00:29:15,386 --> 00:29:18,253
You hypocrites, deniers of life.

361
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:20,753
If you could see me now...

362
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:22,588
what would you think?

363
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:02,999
- Who is it?
- Who is there?

364
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:13,233
Dr. Jekyll, sir.

365
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:15,745
Is that you?

366
00:30:17,181 --> 00:30:18,944
Do you hear me, sir?

367
00:30:20,284 --> 00:30:23,117
Please let me in, sir!

368
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:38,235
I beg your pardon, sir.
I thought I heard a strange voice.

369
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:41,362
That's quite all right.
There was someone here. A friend of mine.

370
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:44,431
His name is Hyde. Mr. Hyde.

371
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:46,869
He's just gone out the back door.

372
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:20,470
Marry me now, my darling.
You don't know how much I need you.

373
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:24,342
I want to with all my heart, but Father...

374
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:27,873
- I'll speak to him. I'll convince him.
- No. Let me talk to him.

375
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:30,614
I'll try to change his mind
while we're away.

376
00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:32,053
- Away?
- Yes.

377
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,888
Darling, I've dreaded telling you...

378
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:37,553
but Father's taking me to Bath tomorrow.

379
00:31:37,628 --> 00:31:40,028
He has no right to take you away from me.

380
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:41,998
Why must we put up with this?

381
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,828
- You want to marry me?
- With all my heart.

382
00:31:45,903 --> 00:31:48,633
We'll marry without his consent.
Say you will, my darling.

383
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:50,674
We'll go to Paris for our honeymoon.

384
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,869
We'll be so gloriously happy...

385
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:55,276
that even the French will be jealous of us.

386
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:58,975
I'm so thrilled and tempted,
but I don't want to hurt my father.

387
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:01,450
It's only a little hurt to his vanity.

388
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,851
You'll do me a greater hurt if you refuse.

389
00:32:03,921 --> 00:32:06,048
Do be patient, just a little while.

390
00:32:06,924 --> 00:32:09,119
I'm sure I can persuade him
while we're gone.

391
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:12,094
- But, Muriel...
- Darling, don't you love me enough...

392
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,257
to wait a little while?

393
00:32:17,568 --> 00:32:19,695
Of course I love you enough, dear.

394
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:22,862
And I'll wait.

395
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:34,548
And wait.

396
00:32:53,571 --> 00:32:54,833
Come in.

397
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,875
A letter from Bath, sir.

398
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:18,060
Miss Muriel won't be home
for another month.

399
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:21,788
- Can't even go to see her.
- I'm sorry to hear it, sir.

400
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:25,167
- Another month.
- I beg your pardon, sir...

401
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:28,501
but may I suggest
that you ought to amuse yourself.

402
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:31,835
Amuse myself?
What do you suggest, Poole?

403
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:33,774
You ought to go out, sir.

404
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:37,576
London offers many amusements
for a gentleman like you, sir.

405
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:40,684
Yes, but a gentleman like me
daren't take advantage of them.

406
00:33:40,751 --> 00:33:44,687
Gentlemen like me must be very careful
of what they do and say.

407
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,619
- That's all.
- Yes, sir.

408
00:37:18,235 --> 00:37:21,602
Here! What are you after down there?

409
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:26,335
I was calling on the young lady
who occupies the little nest.

410
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:29,038
If it's Ivy Pearson you mean, she ain't in.

411
00:37:30,714 --> 00:37:32,978
Do you know where I can find her?

412
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:36,645
If I was wanting her,
I'd try the Variety Music Hall.

413
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,655
I thank you!

414
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:44,522
You get out!
What do you take me for? Get out!

415
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:09,379
- Stay out!
- I didn't do nothing.

416
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:47,079
Bottle of champagne and be quick about it.

417
00:38:47,858 --> 00:38:50,190
- What are you staring at?
- Nothing, sir.

418
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:36,868
What are you waiting for? A tip? Get out!

419
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:39,506
Blighter.

420
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,710
- I'm sorry, sir.
- You swine!

421
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:50,952
He's a rum one.

422
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,027
Let's have a drink.

423
00:40:29,126 --> 00:40:30,354
I will.

424
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,626
You're a bit of something
to look at and listen to, dearie.

425
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:37,860
Not half bad, so they say.

426
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:41,561
- You ain't conceited, are you?
- I has me points.

427
00:40:43,307 --> 00:40:46,743
- Charlie!
- Blimey, there's Irv. I'll be back.

428
00:40:48,045 --> 00:40:49,171
Hey, you!

429
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:55,450
Tell that wenching brat to come over
and have a bottle of wine with me.

430
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:57,214
- Yes, sir.
- That's right.

431
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:04,653
The gent there wants you
to have wine with him.

432
00:41:04,728 --> 00:41:07,094
He does, does he? What of it?

433
00:41:07,164 --> 00:41:09,064
Come if you know what's good for you.

434
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,896
He ain't one to be trifled with.

435
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:13,493
Strike me pink. You interest me.

436
00:41:14,471 --> 00:41:15,961
I'll take a chance.

437
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:20,203
- Where is he?
- I'll take you to him.

438
00:41:31,588 --> 00:41:35,183
This is indeed a great honor.
I noticed you as you came in, my dear.

439
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:36,749
"There," I said to myself...

440
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:39,762
"is too pretty a girl to waste
on such a companion."

441
00:41:41,131 --> 00:41:42,723
But you are pretty.

442
00:41:42,966 --> 00:41:45,662
And what a figure, my dear.

443
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:52,498
A glass of champagne. To you, my dear.

444
00:41:52,943 --> 00:41:54,342
To your beauty.

445
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:04,483
- I must be going now.
- Going. Where?

446
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:07,317
- Home.
- You call that home?

447
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:11,724
- That pigsty of yours in Diadem Court.
- Sty, is it? You come off that.

448
00:42:12,062 --> 00:42:14,553
I like you when your temper's up, my dear.

449
00:42:14,832 --> 00:42:16,697
How do you know where I live?

450
00:42:17,668 --> 00:42:19,898
I saw you on the street and followed you.

451
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:22,029
My pretty, you deserve better than that.

452
00:42:22,106 --> 00:42:24,267
You ought to live in a place worthy of you.

453
00:42:24,341 --> 00:42:26,241
Buckingham Palace, I suppose.

454
00:42:28,645 --> 00:42:32,581
That's the spirit I like. Sit down, my dear.
Sit down just for a moment.

455
00:42:32,783 --> 00:42:36,549
You should have a place
that would set off that fine body of yours...

456
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:39,155
yellow hair and pale face.

457
00:42:39,656 --> 00:42:42,489
Clothes to match, too, my dear. Silk, eh?

458
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:45,194
And a bracelet, too?

459
00:42:45,596 --> 00:42:49,191
Champagne to drink?
How would you like that?

460
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:51,533
And how am I to get it?

461
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:56,906
How do you think you're going to get it,
my bright little bird?

462
00:43:00,144 --> 00:43:04,080
I am no gentleman, no, but I have money.

463
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:07,276
Perhaps my looks don't please you.

464
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:11,685
- You ain't no beauty.
- Quite right. I am no beauty.

465
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:14,516
Perhaps you prefer a gentleman?

466
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:18,793
One of those fine-mannered, virtuous,
and honorable gentlemen.

467
00:43:19,663 --> 00:43:22,860
One of those canting hypocrites
who like your legs...

468
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:24,798
but talk about your garter.

469
00:43:24,868 --> 00:43:26,995
What are you talking about?

470
00:43:27,371 --> 00:43:28,929
My poor little innocent.

471
00:43:29,306 --> 00:43:32,298
It doesn't know what I'm talking about.

472
00:43:33,477 --> 00:43:35,877
Well, it's afraid of me, isn't it?

473
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:39,541
- No! I ain't afraid of you.
- Aren't you? Good.

474
00:43:39,616 --> 00:43:43,108
Hey, you. Trying to steal my girl, are you,
you dirty blighter?

475
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:45,781
- Come back, you. I'll fix you...
- Sit down!

476
00:43:45,856 --> 00:43:48,791
- I'll knock your blooming...
- Get out of here, you!

477
00:43:58,635 --> 00:44:02,071
- You couldn't have done it.
- Couldn't I, though? Why not?

478
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:04,933
This place was just made for it.

479
00:44:05,442 --> 00:44:07,342
- Come on.
- Stop that. Let me go.

480
00:44:07,411 --> 00:44:10,437
- No. You're not going.
- Let me go! I'm going!

481
00:44:11,748 --> 00:44:13,215
I'm going home!

482
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:15,246
Sit down!

483
00:44:16,353 --> 00:44:18,412
Forgive me, my dear.

484
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:21,049
You see, I hurt you because I love you.

485
00:44:21,525 --> 00:44:23,356
I want you...

486
00:44:23,894 --> 00:44:27,159
and what I want, I get.

487
00:44:27,698 --> 00:44:29,859
I grant you, I am no beauty...

488
00:44:30,467 --> 00:44:32,833
but under this exterior...

489
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:37,802
you'll find a very flower of man.

490
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:39,540
Look at me.

491
00:44:40,377 --> 00:44:43,244
Do you suppose I'd let anybody
stand in my way?

492
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:45,106
I love you.

493
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:47,809
I love you. Do you understand?

494
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:50,319
You'll come with me?

495
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:55,720
You'll come with me.

496
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:09,695
Come in, sir.

497
00:45:11,408 --> 00:45:14,969
- I presume your master is out.
- Yes, sir. So he is, sir.

498
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:16,876
He's always out when I call.

499
00:45:17,314 --> 00:45:19,942
Tell your master I've had a letter
from General Carew.

500
00:45:20,017 --> 00:45:23,612
He tells me that Dr. Jekyll has not replied
to any of Miss Muriel's letters.

501
00:45:23,687 --> 00:45:26,281
- She's worried about him.
- I'll tell him, sir.

502
00:45:26,423 --> 00:45:29,085
Anyway, I'm relieved to know
he's not confined to his bed.

503
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:32,959
Begging your pardon, sir,
it's my opinion that my master isn't well.

504
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:35,225
He hardly sees his patients, sir.

505
00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:38,166
I haven't seen him myself
for days at a time.

506
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:41,895
He often comes and goes
by the back door of the laboratory, sir.

507
00:45:43,106 --> 00:45:44,937
I must be going, Poole. Good day.

508
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:57,216
- Who's there?
- It's me, dearie, your landlady.

509
00:45:57,287 --> 00:45:58,879
Come in, Mrs. Hawkins.

510
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:02,451
How are you, dearie?

511
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:05,350
You don't have to answer.

512
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:08,159
I can see for myself
you ain't as fit as you ought to be...

513
00:46:08,231 --> 00:46:09,721
and no wonder.

514
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:13,860
- Here, I brought you the newspaper.
- Thank you, Mrs. Hawkins.

515
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:16,095
You're having a cup of tea, I see.

516
00:46:16,173 --> 00:46:18,733
If you don't mind, dearie,
I'll sit with you a minute.

517
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:20,606
I'm that done in.

518
00:46:22,245 --> 00:46:24,110
Will you have a cup of tea, Mrs. Hawkins?

519
00:46:24,181 --> 00:46:26,513
Thank you, dearie. I don't mind if I do.

520
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:29,143
After all, a neighbor's a neighbor, says I.

521
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,047
Here's a bit of a surprise for you.

522
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:35,482
He's a lodger of mine,
and a very likely lad he is, too.

523
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:38,187
His name's Arvis,
and he says to me, says he:

524
00:46:38,328 --> 00:46:41,092
"Who's the pretty lass
what has the parlor?

525
00:46:41,164 --> 00:46:44,656
"I wonder if she'd be inclined to drop in
at the music hall with me...

526
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,464
"one of these fine nights.

527
00:46:46,603 --> 00:46:49,595
"You ask her," says he.
Now, my advice, dearie...

528
00:46:49,673 --> 00:46:52,198
No. I don't want to hear anymore about it.

529
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:55,044
Afraid of what Hyde will do to you,
ain't you?

530
00:46:55,112 --> 00:46:56,579
No, I ain't afraid.

531
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:01,083
If that blighter was my man,
he wouldn't dare to lay a hand on me...

532
00:47:01,284 --> 00:47:03,309
not if he knowed what was good for him.

533
00:47:03,387 --> 00:47:07,346
He's a brute, that's what he is,
and my advice, dearie...

534
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:27,505
- What do you want?
- I've come for the rent, sir.

535
00:47:27,611 --> 00:47:30,739
- You'll get it when it's due.
- Very good, sir.

536
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:40,683
What did that filthy harridan want?

537
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:43,919
She brought me the paper.

538
00:47:44,094 --> 00:47:46,221
- What else?
- Nothing.

539
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:49,164
You aren't lying to me, are you,
my little bird?

540
00:47:49,232 --> 00:47:50,961
No, I ain't lying to you.

541
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:52,661
If I ever catch you lying...

542
00:47:52,736 --> 00:47:55,261
these are a trifle to what you'll get.

543
00:47:55,338 --> 00:47:56,635
A trifle!

544
00:48:31,274 --> 00:48:32,605
Come here.

545
00:48:38,315 --> 00:48:42,445
Sit down so that I can look at you,
my sweetling.

546
00:48:47,924 --> 00:48:50,893
- Say it aloud.
- What do you mean?

547
00:48:52,829 --> 00:48:56,128
Don't you think
I can read your thoughts, you trull?

548
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,899
You hate me, don't you?
I'm not good enough for you!

549
00:49:00,003 --> 00:49:02,938
I'm not a nice, kind gentleman like that...

550
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:08,234
Nice, kind gentlemen
who are so good to look at and so...

551
00:49:09,412 --> 00:49:11,175
Cowards! Weaklings!

552
00:49:14,918 --> 00:49:17,216
Tell me you hate me. Please, my lamb.

553
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:20,279
My dear, sweet, pretty little bird,
tell me that you hate me.

554
00:49:20,357 --> 00:49:23,793
- I don't know what you mean.
- Don't you, my lamb?

555
00:49:24,828 --> 00:49:28,355
- Then you don't hate me?
- No, sir.

556
00:49:29,933 --> 00:49:33,266
If you don't hate me, you must love me.

557
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:37,095
- Isn't that so, my little one? Isn't it?
- Yes, sir.

558
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:42,905
How you must love me.
I want to hear you say it.

559
00:49:43,346 --> 00:49:46,804
- Say it. Come, my wench. Say it!
- Yes, sir!

560
00:49:46,883 --> 00:49:48,214
Of course.

561
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:54,950
I've got bad news for you, my dear.

562
00:49:56,026 --> 00:49:57,288
Very bad.

563
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:03,255
I'm going away for a few days.

564
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:10,206
And upon my word,
if you don't seem pleased.

565
00:50:11,474 --> 00:50:14,307
- And you are pleased, aren't you?
- No, sir, I ain't pleased.

566
00:50:14,377 --> 00:50:15,969
You are pleased!

567
00:50:17,614 --> 00:50:20,708
But pleasure is brief in this world,
my sweet...

568
00:50:21,384 --> 00:50:24,444
and yours is most uncertain...

569
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:29,519
because you don't know when I'll be back.
Do you?

570
00:50:30,427 --> 00:50:32,657
- No, sir.
- "No, sir."

571
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:36,527
Remember, you belong to me,
do you hear?

572
00:50:38,301 --> 00:50:41,737
If you do one thing
that I don't approve of while I'm gone...

573
00:50:41,805 --> 00:50:44,296
the least little thing, mind you...

574
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:48,333
I'll show you what horror means.

575
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,382
Are you going now?

576
00:51:01,591 --> 00:51:03,286
- Tonight?
- Now.

577
00:51:04,828 --> 00:51:07,319
Why, my dear, I'm surprised at you.

578
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:11,333
What a leave-taking that would be.

579
00:51:12,669 --> 00:51:15,502
You wouldn't have me go tonight,
would you?

580
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:19,206
Would you let me go tonight? Would you?

581
00:51:21,378 --> 00:51:24,074
- No, sir.
- Of course not.

582
00:51:24,948 --> 00:51:27,314
Quite unworthy of our great love.

583
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:33,817
No, my dear, I'm not going now.

584
00:51:34,991 --> 00:51:39,724
I'm going to spend the evening here
with you just as you want.

585
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:41,855
Say, "Just as I want."

586
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:46,927
- "Just as I want."
- That's right, my little bird.

587
00:51:47,904 --> 00:51:51,340
The last evening is always the sweetest,
you know.

588
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:55,606
And what a farewell this one will be.

589
00:51:56,112 --> 00:51:58,046
What a farewell.

590
00:51:59,049 --> 00:52:02,143
I don't know whether I shall
be able to tear myself away from you.

591
00:52:02,218 --> 00:52:04,812
Perhaps I shall go only as far as the door...

592
00:52:04,888 --> 00:52:07,948
and the sight of your tears
will bring me back.

593
00:52:09,092 --> 00:52:12,619
- Does that please you, my dear?
- Yes, sir.

594
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:17,261
Why don't you show it, then?
Why don't you dance?

595
00:52:18,034 --> 00:52:21,333
Why don't you sing? Sing, my dear!

596
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:23,735
Sing, my little pigeon!

597
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:26,938
Get up and sing! You hear?

598
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:52,267
Look, my darling, how tight your garter is.

599
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:54,129
You mustn't wear it so tight.

600
00:52:54,304 --> 00:52:57,398
It will bruise your pretty, tender flesh.

601
00:53:28,438 --> 00:53:29,928
Your tea, sir.

602
00:53:32,208 --> 00:53:33,835
Thank you, Poole.

603
00:53:34,811 --> 00:53:36,836
I shall be going out presently.

604
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:41,616
- Miss Muriel is returning to London today.
- Very good, sir.

605
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:47,888
- See this key, Poole?
- Yes, sir.

606
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:52,822
It's the key
to the back door of the laboratory, sir.

607
00:53:55,198 --> 00:53:57,496
I'll have no further use for it.

608
00:54:07,477 --> 00:54:11,038
From now on, I'll use only the front door.

609
00:54:11,881 --> 00:54:13,143
Yes, sir.

610
00:54:28,698 --> 00:54:31,667
Deliver this to Miss Ivy Pearson,
Diadem Court, Soho.

611
00:54:32,802 --> 00:54:36,294
- Any message, sir?
- None. Deliver it and come away.

612
00:54:37,807 --> 00:54:41,834
- Hyde'll kill you one day.
- I wish he would kill me. I wish he would.

613
00:54:41,911 --> 00:54:43,674
Why don't you run away?

614
00:54:43,746 --> 00:54:46,306
Where to? He'd find me wherever I was.

615
00:54:46,382 --> 00:54:49,681
Then why don't you go to the police?
They'd fix this Hyde man.

616
00:54:49,752 --> 00:54:51,276
No. I'm afraid.

617
00:54:52,055 --> 00:54:54,683
There ain't nobody to help me. Nobody.

618
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:57,756
Who cares
what becomes of the likes of me?

619
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:01,988
Come in.

620
00:55:05,668 --> 00:55:07,499
Miss Ivy Pearson?

621
00:55:09,172 --> 00:55:12,767
- That's me.
- This is from my master, Dr. Jekyll, miss.

622
00:55:12,842 --> 00:55:16,039
- Not Dr. Henry L. Jekyll?
- Quite so.

623
00:55:16,446 --> 00:55:19,244
He said there is no answer.
Good day, miss.

624
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:26,088
I don't know Dr. Jekyll.

625
00:55:29,325 --> 00:55:30,792
Fifty pounds!

626
00:55:31,394 --> 00:55:34,386
Well, he knows you, dearie.

627
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:36,755
Strike me pink!

628
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:39,898
Fifty pounds
from the celebrated Dr. Jekyll.

629
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:43,496
He's a grand gentleman,
always helping them what needs help.

630
00:55:43,573 --> 00:55:46,201
Now, dearie, he sends you fifty pounds...

631
00:55:46,276 --> 00:55:48,210
shows he takes an interest in you.

632
00:55:48,278 --> 00:55:51,042
Why don't you go
and thank the gentleman proper?

633
00:55:51,247 --> 00:55:54,239
Then you could tell him
all about this here Hyde business.

634
00:55:54,317 --> 00:55:57,844
He'll tell that blighter what's what.
You'll see if he don't.

635
00:55:58,154 --> 00:56:01,385
You made me suffer so.
Now you tell me nothing.

636
00:56:01,457 --> 00:56:04,893
I tell you no man ever needed another
or loved another...

637
00:56:04,961 --> 00:56:06,861
as I need and love you.

638
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:09,055
I don't know what to say...

639
00:56:09,132 --> 00:56:11,794
but if you'd been ill
that would have been different.

640
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:13,460
I was ill, my darling.

641
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:16,130
Why didn't you let me know?
I should have come at once.

642
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:18,936
I wasn't ill in body. I was ill in soul.

643
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:22,906
The sufferings of the spirit
are so difficult to communicate...

644
00:56:22,979 --> 00:56:24,446
even to those who love you.

645
00:56:24,514 --> 00:56:28,814
Do you think there's anything that has
to do with you that I wouldn't understand?

646
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:32,343
I know that you're gentle
and understanding, but...

647
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:36,791
I can't explain to you.

648
00:56:38,528 --> 00:56:41,395
I've played with dangerous knowledge.

649
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:47,192
I've walked a strange and terrible road.

650
00:56:48,705 --> 00:56:50,229
Help me to find my way back.

651
00:56:50,873 --> 00:56:52,534
Oh, my sweet.

652
00:56:52,675 --> 00:56:55,405
When you're all mine to love and keep...

653
00:56:55,612 --> 00:56:59,241
I shall be patient as the earth with you.

654
00:56:59,682 --> 00:57:03,083
Then let's not wait any longer.
Let us be married at once.

655
00:57:03,286 --> 00:57:07,245
I want to with all my heart.
Take me. Take me soon.

656
00:57:07,557 --> 00:57:10,048
I love you, and I want to help you.

657
00:57:14,564 --> 00:57:15,553
Muriel.

658
00:57:17,967 --> 00:57:20,026
I didn't expect to find you here, sir.

659
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:22,901
I've just made my profoundest apologies
to Muriel.

660
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:26,404
- What about me?
- Permit me to make them to you, sir...

661
00:57:26,476 --> 00:57:28,467
and to trust that you will be indulgent.

662
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:31,842
You haven't explained anything yet, sir.

663
00:57:33,316 --> 00:57:36,046
I was not quite myself, sir. I was ill.

664
00:57:36,352 --> 00:57:37,478
Ill?

665
00:57:38,988 --> 00:57:41,388
In that case, of course,
we'll say no more about it.

666
00:57:41,457 --> 00:57:44,585
Thank you, sir. May I take
further advantage of your indulgence?

667
00:57:44,661 --> 00:57:48,620
- Yes. What is it?
- Your consent to our early marriage.

668
00:57:48,731 --> 00:57:51,393
Please, Father. Do say yes.
Harry needs me.

669
00:57:51,467 --> 00:57:54,436
- I've already told you.
- We're too unhappy apart.

670
00:57:54,504 --> 00:57:57,598
Please, Father. This is the most important
request of my life.

671
00:57:57,674 --> 00:58:01,508
- I see no reason to change my mind.
- Isn't my happiness reason enough?

672
00:58:01,577 --> 00:58:04,637
I assure you, sir,
you will have no cause to regret it.

673
00:58:04,714 --> 00:58:08,673
To be frank, Jekyll,
I'm not at all satisfied with your conduct.

674
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:12,579
- I don't understand you, sir.
- I expect a man in your position...

675
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:15,249
to observe certain traditions.

676
00:58:16,192 --> 00:58:20,686
I want to see you more settled down
before I entrust my daughter to your care.

677
00:58:21,097 --> 00:58:23,429
You're too flighty, too impatient...

678
00:58:23,499 --> 00:58:25,763
Believe me, these faults will be corrected.

679
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:28,804
- I give you my word of honor.
- Please, Father.

680
00:58:28,905 --> 00:58:31,032
My whole life is concerned.

681
00:58:31,908 --> 00:58:33,170
Please.

682
00:58:35,478 --> 00:58:37,878
Well, I see you're overriding me.

683
00:58:38,815 --> 00:58:41,340
Jekyll, remember
you gave me your word of honor.

684
00:58:41,417 --> 00:58:42,645
Yes, sir.

685
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:46,152
Very well.
You shall be married next month.

686
00:58:46,322 --> 00:58:50,190
Come to dinner tomorrow and we'll make
a formal announcement to our friends.

687
00:58:50,259 --> 00:58:52,386
Thank you, sir.
By Jove, you've made me happy!

688
00:58:52,462 --> 00:58:55,556
- I could sing or dance or roll a hoop...
- Jekyll, no.

689
00:58:55,631 --> 00:58:58,896
I beg your pardon, sir.
Until tomorrow, my sweet.

690
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:02,470
- Good-bye, sir.
- Good-bye.

691
00:59:14,317 --> 00:59:16,251
Poole, my dear fellow!

692
00:59:16,953 --> 00:59:20,480
- I'm a very happy man!
- I'm happy to hear it!

693
00:59:20,556 --> 00:59:23,389
Happy, by Jove! Happy!

694
00:59:23,659 --> 00:59:27,390
"...jocund day stands tiptoe
on the misty mountain tops."

695
00:59:27,463 --> 00:59:28,487
Yes, sir.

696
00:59:29,098 --> 00:59:30,793
May I take your cape, sir?

697
00:59:30,867 --> 00:59:33,665
You may, Poole. You may, my dear fellow.

698
00:59:34,103 --> 00:59:36,264
I'm going to be married, Poole.
Next month.

699
00:59:36,339 --> 00:59:39,365
Think of it. In a few weeks,
she'll be under this very roof...

700
00:59:39,442 --> 00:59:42,002
in this very room, as my wife.

701
00:59:42,278 --> 00:59:44,746
Think of it, Poole,
and let me see your face.

702
00:59:44,947 --> 00:59:48,815
Yes, sir! I beg to congratulate you, sir!

703
00:59:50,553 --> 00:59:53,716
- "If music be the food of love, play on."
- Yes.

704
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:21,306
I beg your pardon, sir...

705
01:00:21,384 --> 01:00:24,478
but Miss Pearson is waiting for you
in the consulting room.

706
01:00:24,554 --> 01:00:25,578
Miss Pearson?

707
01:00:25,655 --> 01:00:28,215
The young woman
as you sent the envelope to, sir.

708
01:00:29,559 --> 01:00:32,926
- What does she want?
- She wishes to consult you, sir.

709
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:42,593
- Very well. Show her in here.
- Yes, sir.

710
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:07,224
- Why, it's you, sir!
- So it is.

711
01:01:08,965 --> 01:01:10,557
Now who would have thought it?

712
01:01:11,234 --> 01:01:15,398
Who would have thought
that I'd find the celebrated Dr. Jekyll?

713
01:01:17,473 --> 01:01:21,136
- So it was you who sent me this money.
- Yes.

714
01:01:22,945 --> 01:01:26,642
The minute I laid eyes on you,
I knew you had a kind heart.

715
01:01:27,083 --> 01:01:31,110
- But whatever made you do it, sir?
- Someone told me that you needed it.

716
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:32,484
- Who, sir?
- It doesn't matter.

717
01:01:32,555 --> 01:01:36,286
The important thing is that you have it.
And you're welcome to it.

718
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:38,156
I can't take it, sir.

719
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:40,658
- Why not?
- Why?

720
01:01:42,298 --> 01:01:44,789
Here's why!

721
01:01:44,934 --> 01:01:47,368
Pretty, ain't it?
It's a whip, that's what it is.

722
01:01:48,137 --> 01:01:49,832
Horrible!

723
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:53,004
I'll give you a lotion to soothe that.

724
01:01:53,075 --> 01:01:55,976
Thank you, sir,
but a lotion won't do the trick, sir.

725
01:01:56,045 --> 01:02:00,004
No, sir. It's more than that, sir.
I need help, I do.

726
01:02:00,283 --> 01:02:02,046
I can't stand it anymore.

727
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:04,550
- What is it, my dear?
- It's Hyde, sir.

728
01:02:05,688 --> 01:02:09,419
It's him that's done that,
and more as I can't tell you, sir.

729
01:02:09,492 --> 01:02:12,359
He ain't human, sir. He's a beast.

730
01:02:12,428 --> 01:02:15,761
He won't let me go,
and I'm afraid to run away.

731
01:02:16,666 --> 01:02:20,602
I've tried to drown myself, but I can't!

732
01:02:22,271 --> 01:02:24,205
And if you don't help me...

733
01:02:24,473 --> 01:02:27,533
you as had
the kindest heart in the world, sir...

734
01:02:28,544 --> 01:02:30,842
then give me poison so I can kill myself!

735
01:02:30,913 --> 01:02:34,178
- Why didn't you go to the police?
- I was afraid.

736
01:02:35,051 --> 01:02:38,179
You don't know him, sir.
He ain't a man. He's a devil.

737
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:40,415
He knows what you're thinking about.

738
01:02:40,489 --> 01:02:42,787
I'm afraid of him now!

739
01:02:43,059 --> 01:02:46,324
If he knows as I've been here today,
I don't know what he'll do!

740
01:02:46,395 --> 01:02:49,626
It won't be anything human, sir! Save me!

741
01:02:51,133 --> 01:02:53,431
Keep him off me! I'll do anything you ask!

742
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:55,699
I'll be your slave.

743
01:02:56,772 --> 01:02:58,000
Help me!

744
01:03:08,651 --> 01:03:10,516
You are good, you are.

745
01:03:11,887 --> 01:03:14,947
You won't let me go back to him,
will you, sir?

746
01:03:16,859 --> 01:03:18,417
You're an angel.

747
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:30,663
I'll do anything you like.

748
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:34,204
I ain't as bad as you think...

749
01:03:35,011 --> 01:03:37,070
and I ain't a bad looker, either.

750
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:42,216
I'll work for you. I'll slave for you.

751
01:03:42,952 --> 01:03:44,442
I'll love you.

752
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:49,219
You liked me once, didn't you?

753
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:53,087
Why don't you...

754
01:04:08,144 --> 01:04:11,671
I give you my word that you will
never be troubled with Hyde again.

755
01:04:11,747 --> 01:04:14,307
No, sir! He'll come back and kill me, sir!

756
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:17,016
He'll not come back. I'll see to it.

757
01:04:17,086 --> 01:04:20,112
But you don't know him, sir.
He ain't human, he ain't.

758
01:04:21,057 --> 01:04:24,356
I've given you my word,
and that I never break.

759
01:04:25,895 --> 01:04:29,763
You'll not see Hyde again. Believe me.

760
01:04:33,669 --> 01:04:35,398
I believe you, sir.

761
01:04:46,082 --> 01:04:48,573
- You must go now.
- Yes, sir.

762
01:05:15,945 --> 01:05:19,574
Begging your pardon, sir,
will it be a large affair?

763
01:05:19,782 --> 01:05:23,047
Not particularly.
General Carew's cronies, chiefly.

764
01:05:23,552 --> 01:05:25,713
They wouldn't regard the marriage
as authentic...

765
01:05:25,788 --> 01:05:28,723
unless it were formally announced
at a dinner table, you know?

766
01:05:28,791 --> 01:05:32,352
Perhaps soon you'll be giving
a formal dinner yourself, sir.

767
01:05:32,428 --> 01:05:33,827
I may, Poole.

768
01:05:33,896 --> 01:05:36,126
- Should I call the hansom, sir?
- No, thank you.

769
01:05:36,198 --> 01:05:38,359
- A walk through the park will do me good.
- Yes.

770
01:05:38,567 --> 01:05:40,865
- We're early.
- I'm glad you are.

771
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:44,064
My dear,
of course, I wish you all happiness.

772
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:46,540
- Thank you, Dr. Lanyon.
- How are you, General?

773
01:06:06,228 --> 01:06:09,857
"Thou wast not born for death,
immortal bird!"

774
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,496
"No hungry generations tread thee
down..."

775
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:19,599
"Thou wast not born for death..."

776
01:06:23,078 --> 01:06:24,272
No!

777
01:06:38,561 --> 01:06:41,655
"Thou wast not born for death..."

778
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:08,784
Oh, no.

779
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:20,295
But it is dead!

780
01:07:45,027 --> 01:07:46,426
Rather late.

781
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:54,267
- It's very queer, I did not hear.
- I do not understand.

782
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:02,904
Of course, he is a very busy man.
He was probably detained.

783
01:08:03,846 --> 01:08:06,212
Could anything have happened to Harry,
Mr. Utterson?

784
01:08:06,282 --> 01:08:08,978
On a night like this, my dear? Nonsense.

785
01:08:09,051 --> 01:08:10,541
Why is he late, then?

786
01:08:10,619 --> 01:08:14,282
There, my dear.
It's not his lateness. It's your impatience.

787
01:08:14,356 --> 01:08:16,256
He'll be along presently.

788
01:08:17,393 --> 01:08:18,724
I hope so.

789
01:08:39,682 --> 01:08:42,981
Here's hoping
that Hyde rots wherever he is...

790
01:08:43,085 --> 01:08:45,383
and burns where he ought to be.

791
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:51,392
And here's hoping that Dr. Jekyll...

792
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:54,691
will think of Ivy once in a while.

793
01:08:56,131 --> 01:08:57,928
He's an angel, he is.

794
01:08:59,168 --> 01:09:01,762
Here's to you, my angel.

795
01:09:35,404 --> 01:09:37,929
Thought I wouldn't come back, didn't you?

796
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:41,704
You took the word of that
sniveling hypocrite Jekyll against mine.

797
01:09:41,777 --> 01:09:43,938
Jekyll's word against Hyde's?

798
01:09:44,346 --> 01:09:47,611
I know everything you do
and everything you think!

799
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:50,215
You went down on your knees
before him...

800
01:09:50,285 --> 01:09:52,753
the man I hate
more than anybody in the world!

801
01:09:52,821 --> 01:09:54,345
- No!
- No?

802
01:09:54,590 --> 01:09:57,252
"I'll slave for you. I'll love you.

803
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:59,660
"You're an angel, sir."

804
01:10:00,596 --> 01:10:03,292
You wanted him to love you, didn't you?

805
01:10:03,732 --> 01:10:05,757
I'll give you a lover now.

806
01:10:06,702 --> 01:10:10,433
- His name is death!
- No! It ain't so!

807
01:10:14,777 --> 01:10:19,077
Ain't it so, my little bird? My little starling.

808
01:10:19,848 --> 01:10:23,579
Why, you lying wench!
You've got his money here now!

809
01:10:24,486 --> 01:10:25,817
You must be the devil.

810
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:28,118
There was nobody there
but me and Dr. Jekyll.

811
01:10:28,190 --> 01:10:30,681
He wouldn't have told you!
No, he wouldn't!

812
01:10:30,759 --> 01:10:33,159
Wouldn't he, though? Wouldn't he?

813
01:10:33,262 --> 01:10:34,524
Listen, my dear.

814
01:10:35,464 --> 01:10:37,955
I'm going to let you into a secret.

815
01:10:38,033 --> 01:10:39,967
A secret so great...

816
01:10:40,335 --> 01:10:43,236
that those who share it with me
cannot live!

817
01:10:45,474 --> 01:10:48,204
I am Jekyll!

818
01:10:50,479 --> 01:10:54,745
I am the angel
whom you wanted to slave for and love!

819
01:10:55,284 --> 01:10:58,344
And I'm going to take you in my arms now
and hold you close!

820
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:01,150
Close, my little lamb. My dove!

821
01:11:01,423 --> 01:11:02,720
My bird!

822
01:11:25,414 --> 01:11:28,178
There, my sweet.

823
01:11:29,017 --> 01:11:32,043
There, my dove.

824
01:11:32,855 --> 01:11:36,291
There, my little bride.

825
01:11:38,093 --> 01:11:41,392
Isn't Hyde a lover after your own heart?

826
01:11:55,511 --> 01:11:57,570
There's something horrible
happening up there!

827
01:11:57,646 --> 01:11:59,477
- Did you hear it?
- Come on.

828
01:12:03,952 --> 01:12:06,182
- You murdering devil!
- Help!

829
01:12:12,227 --> 01:12:13,922
Stop him!

830
01:12:26,642 --> 01:12:29,941
- The monster did this.
- I know him. His name is Hyde.

831
01:13:04,146 --> 01:13:07,047
- Let me in. I'm a friend of Dr. Jekyll's.
- He isn't at home!

832
01:13:07,115 --> 01:13:09,743
I know it, you fool!
He told me to wait for him.

833
01:13:09,818 --> 01:13:14,084
- You'll have to come back later!
- Open that door, or I'll break it in!

834
01:13:22,965 --> 01:13:25,593
My dear, I can't tell you how sorry I am...

835
01:13:25,734 --> 01:13:30,296
but I hope with all my heart that Jekyll
will have something to say for himself.

836
01:13:30,372 --> 01:13:32,966
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, Lanyon.

837
01:13:34,643 --> 01:13:37,874
I'll cane that scoundrel Jekyll
if I ever set eyes on him again.

838
01:13:37,946 --> 01:13:40,210
No, Father.
Something terrible must have happened.

839
01:13:40,282 --> 01:13:42,648
I'm sure he can explain. I believe in him.

840
01:13:42,718 --> 01:13:45,209
I forbid you to see this man again.

841
01:13:45,387 --> 01:13:48,220
I love him, Father,
and I'm going to marry him.

842
01:13:48,290 --> 01:13:51,657
Muriel, you will have
nothing more to do with that man.

843
01:13:51,793 --> 01:13:54,387
- Give me pencil and paper, quick.
- Yes, sir.

844
01:13:54,463 --> 01:13:57,398
Hey, you.
Be ready to carry a message for me.

845
01:13:57,599 --> 01:13:58,861
Yes, sir.

846
01:14:04,039 --> 01:14:06,473
- Hello, Briggs.
- Good evening, sir.

847
01:14:07,709 --> 01:14:09,609
I beg your pardon, sir.

848
01:14:09,678 --> 01:14:11,771
A messenger brought this
a little while ago.

849
01:14:11,847 --> 01:14:14,748
- Really?
- He said it was very important, sir.

850
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:46,406
I'm going out, Briggs, but I'll be back soon.

851
01:14:46,481 --> 01:14:47,709
Yes, sir.

852
01:14:51,887 --> 01:14:54,583
You may go to bed.
I won't need you any more tonight.

853
01:14:54,656 --> 01:14:55,987
Thank you, sir.

854
01:15:14,876 --> 01:15:17,242
- I come from Dr. Jekyll.
- Come in.

855
01:15:19,848 --> 01:15:21,440
Have you got it?

856
01:15:22,250 --> 01:15:23,581
Follow me.

857
01:15:29,091 --> 01:15:30,456
Have you got it?

858
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:35,359
Come, sir. You forget I have not
the pleasure of your acquaintance.

859
01:15:35,931 --> 01:15:37,523
I beg your pardon, Dr. Lanyon.

860
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:39,931
You know what I came for.
Dr. Jekyll sent me.

861
01:15:40,168 --> 01:15:43,797
- It's important. A package. Is it here?
- Yes.

862
01:15:48,677 --> 01:15:51,510
Here it is, but before I give it to you...

863
01:15:51,646 --> 01:15:54,444
I must be assured of Dr. Jekyll's safety.

864
01:15:55,050 --> 01:15:56,847
- Where is he?
- He's alive and safe.

865
01:15:56,918 --> 01:15:59,079
- I'll take this to him.
- I'll go with you.

866
01:15:59,187 --> 01:16:02,281
- I must see for myself that he is safe.
- That is not your concern!

867
01:16:02,357 --> 01:16:03,449
I warn you not to meddle.

868
01:16:03,525 --> 01:16:06,153
Take me to Dr. Jekyll,
or you'll not leave this room.

869
01:16:06,595 --> 01:16:08,062
I warn you, Lanyon, to let me go.

870
01:16:08,130 --> 01:16:10,496
If you make another step
towards that door...

871
01:16:10,565 --> 01:16:12,760
- I'll shoot.
- You don't know what you're doing.

872
01:16:12,834 --> 01:16:15,302
I can't tell you anything.
Ask Jekyll tomorrow.

873
01:16:15,370 --> 01:16:18,737
I will be sure of Dr. Jekyll's safety,
or I'll make you answer for it.

874
01:16:21,543 --> 01:16:24,239
For the last time, Lanyon,
will you let me go?

875
01:16:24,312 --> 01:16:26,177
For the last time, no.

876
01:16:27,516 --> 01:16:29,177
Very well, Lanyon.

877
01:16:30,152 --> 01:16:32,382
This will be on your own head.

878
01:17:05,487 --> 01:17:06,886
Now, Lanyon...

879
01:17:08,056 --> 01:17:11,423
will you let me take this glass and leave
without further question?

880
01:17:11,693 --> 01:17:14,127
I've gone too far
not to see this through to the end.

881
01:17:14,196 --> 01:17:16,721
Think before you decide, I tell you!

882
01:17:17,065 --> 01:17:18,999
Do you want to be left as you are...

883
01:17:19,134 --> 01:17:22,865
or do you want your eyes and your soul
to be blasted by a sight...

884
01:17:22,938 --> 01:17:24,667
that would stagger the devil himself?

885
01:17:24,739 --> 01:17:28,641
- I'm not to be persuaded by this rigmarole.
- Very well, Lanyon.

886
01:17:30,178 --> 01:17:32,806
Remember your vows to your profession.

887
01:17:33,248 --> 01:17:37,309
What you are about to see
is a secret you are sworn not to reveal.

888
01:17:41,356 --> 01:17:44,519
You who have sneered
at the miracles of science...

889
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:49,358
you who have denied the power of man
to look into his own soul...

890
01:17:49,965 --> 01:17:52,729
you who have derided your superiors.

891
01:17:53,702 --> 01:17:54,760
Look!

892
01:19:16,851 --> 01:19:20,810
I can't believe what I've seen.
I don't understand.

893
01:19:21,089 --> 01:19:23,887
- I'm in your hands to do with as you wish.
- Horrible.

894
01:19:24,292 --> 01:19:28,160
- I'm a murderer, Lanyon. Help me.
- There is no help for you, Jekyll.

895
01:19:28,263 --> 01:19:30,527
You've committed
the supreme blasphemy.

896
01:19:30,599 --> 01:19:31,691
I warned you...

897
01:19:31,766 --> 01:19:35,065
that no man could violate the traditions
of his kind and not be damned.

898
01:19:35,136 --> 01:19:37,263
That I still do not believe.

899
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:39,039
Don't be my inquisitor, Lanyon.

900
01:19:39,107 --> 01:19:41,302
Don't judge me. Help me.
I'm at your mercy.

901
01:19:41,376 --> 01:19:45,472
There is no help for you here
or mercy beyond.

902
01:19:46,381 --> 01:19:50,044
You're a rebel,
and see what it has done for you.

903
01:19:51,386 --> 01:19:54,184
You're in the power of this monster
that you've created.

904
01:19:54,255 --> 01:19:56,883
- I'll never take that drug again.
- Yes.

905
01:19:57,225 --> 01:19:59,955
But you told me
you became that monster tonight...

906
01:20:00,028 --> 01:20:01,928
not of your own accord.

907
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:04,762
- It will happen again.
- Never. I'm sure of it.

908
01:20:04,833 --> 01:20:08,894
- I'll fight it. I'll conquer it.
- Too late. You cannot conquer it.

909
01:20:09,304 --> 01:20:12,705
- It has conquered you.
- No. I'll fight it.

910
01:20:13,108 --> 01:20:16,441
I know it will not happen again. Help me.

911
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:21,180
You'll promise at least
never to mix this drug again?

912
01:20:21,249 --> 01:20:22,409
With all my heart.

913
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:27,511
And what about Muriel?

914
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:33,852
I'll give her up.

915
01:20:36,831 --> 01:20:38,799
I'll go to her tomorrow.

916
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:43,137
Set her free.

917
01:21:24,512 --> 01:21:25,843
Oh, God...

918
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:28,580
this I did not intend.

919
01:21:29,884 --> 01:21:33,945
I saw a light,
but I could not see where it was leading.

920
01:21:35,824 --> 01:21:38,793
I have trespassed on your domain.

921
01:21:40,962 --> 01:21:44,955
I've gone further than man should go.

922
01:21:46,534 --> 01:21:47,762
Forgive me.

923
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:49,594
Help me.

924
01:23:14,656 --> 01:23:17,181
I beg your pardon, sir. Dr. Jekyll is calling.

925
01:23:19,227 --> 01:23:22,196
- Tell him we're not at home, Hobson.
- Father, no, for my sake.

926
01:23:22,263 --> 01:23:23,594
He dares to enter this house?

927
01:23:23,665 --> 01:23:25,496
Neither of us have the right to judge him.

928
01:23:25,567 --> 01:23:28,365
Judge him? Are you mad?
The fellow's a blackguard.

929
01:23:28,436 --> 01:23:31,098
I won't hear you say
one word against him.

930
01:23:31,172 --> 01:23:32,730
- Show him in, Hobson.
- But I...

931
01:23:35,743 --> 01:23:37,176
I don't know what he's done...

932
01:23:37,245 --> 01:23:39,713
but he's a finer and greater person
than any of us.

933
01:23:39,781 --> 01:23:43,114
- Silence! I won't hear another word!
- I shall say it!

934
01:23:43,184 --> 01:23:46,017
We've never understood him
and never tried to understand him.

935
01:23:46,087 --> 01:23:49,022
You tried to bend him to your will.
I haven't fought for him.

936
01:23:49,090 --> 01:23:52,150
I don't know what's happened to him,
but I know he's suffering...

937
01:23:52,227 --> 01:23:55,025
and it's our fault, mine more than yours.

938
01:23:55,697 --> 01:23:57,756
I love him, and I'm going to help him.

939
01:23:57,832 --> 01:24:01,324
This is preposterous!
I will have nothing to do with it!

940
01:24:09,811 --> 01:24:11,836
I can offer you no welcome, sir.

941
01:24:12,447 --> 01:24:16,611
Had the matter been left in my hands,
I would have turned you from the door.

942
01:24:37,372 --> 01:24:38,737
Forgive me.

943
01:24:44,679 --> 01:24:46,476
Darling, are you ill?

944
01:24:47,015 --> 01:24:48,676
- What is it?
- What?

945
01:24:49,517 --> 01:24:50,882
What is it?

946
01:24:51,352 --> 01:24:53,843
My sweet, why are you suffering so?

947
01:24:54,422 --> 01:24:56,652
- Tell me what it is.
- Tell you?

948
01:24:59,494 --> 01:25:01,485
I've come to tell you...

949
01:25:03,231 --> 01:25:05,961
I've come to set you free.

950
01:25:08,036 --> 01:25:10,004
- Set me free?
- Yes.

951
01:25:10,338 --> 01:25:11,532
What are you saying?

952
01:25:11,606 --> 01:25:13,836
If you ever loved me,
tell me what's wrong.

953
01:25:14,008 --> 01:25:15,737
Everything's wrong!

954
01:25:18,313 --> 01:25:21,805
I no longer have any claim on you.

955
01:25:21,883 --> 01:25:24,249
- But that's for me to say.
- No.

956
01:25:24,319 --> 01:25:27,254
My darling, I beg you to tell me.
What is it?

957
01:25:30,058 --> 01:25:32,356
No. You don't have to explain anything.

958
01:25:32,493 --> 01:25:35,053
Whatever it is,
I know you've done nothing base or mean.

959
01:25:35,129 --> 01:25:36,391
Please, my dear!

960
01:25:36,664 --> 01:25:38,928
Please, angel of God...

961
01:25:40,201 --> 01:25:41,930
don't say anymore.

962
01:25:44,739 --> 01:25:46,263
I set you free.

963
01:25:47,008 --> 01:25:49,909
Darling, is that all you have to say to me?

964
01:25:49,978 --> 01:25:52,708
- Don't you want me any longer?
- Want you?

965
01:25:53,681 --> 01:25:57,117
I want you so that I can envy the damned.

966
01:25:59,687 --> 01:26:02,281
- I am damned.
- You don't know what you're saying.

967
01:26:03,157 --> 01:26:04,590
Do you think I'd let you go?

968
01:26:04,659 --> 01:26:07,059
Only tell me that you love me,
and I'm yours.

969
01:26:07,128 --> 01:26:09,096
Don't keep anything from me, darling.

970
01:26:09,163 --> 01:26:12,792
- I love you, and I'll help you.
- My love. My darling.

971
01:26:13,301 --> 01:26:14,825
My beautiful...

972
01:26:15,269 --> 01:26:19,296
if I could take you in my arms,
if I could only touch you...

973
01:26:21,309 --> 01:26:22,708
Think of it.

974
01:26:24,045 --> 01:26:27,208
I daren't even touch you ever again...

975
01:26:28,049 --> 01:26:31,416
- in this world or the next.
- What are you hiding from me?

976
01:26:31,486 --> 01:26:34,148
Trust me. Believe in me. I'll help you.

977
01:26:34,222 --> 01:26:38,022
No. I'm beyond help, Muriel! I'm in hell!

978
01:26:43,398 --> 01:26:45,889
- I must give you up!
- But I won't let you!

979
01:26:45,967 --> 01:26:48,527
- No.
- I'll go with you wherever you say.

980
01:26:48,636 --> 01:26:51,104
I'll help you no matter what it is.

981
01:26:52,540 --> 01:26:55,668
If I could only have you, I'd give my soul...

982
01:26:55,743 --> 01:26:58,177
but I have no soul!

983
01:26:59,714 --> 01:27:01,477
I'm beyond the pale!

984
01:27:02,717 --> 01:27:05,584
- I'm one of the living dead!
- I won't let you go!

985
01:27:06,554 --> 01:27:09,887
My poor, dear, suffering love, be quiet.

986
01:27:10,024 --> 01:27:13,790
Rest. Don't say anymore.
Be quiet and rest.

987
01:27:22,370 --> 01:27:26,500
- Let me go. Let me go quickly.
- No. I love you. I won't let you go.

988
01:27:27,075 --> 01:27:29,305
I love you.

989
01:27:30,545 --> 01:27:32,536
- Sweetheart.
- No!

990
01:27:33,915 --> 01:27:36,850
I give you up because I love you so.

991
01:27:37,618 --> 01:27:41,179
This is my proof. This is my penance.

992
01:27:41,923 --> 01:27:43,686
Do you hear, oh, God?

993
01:28:49,457 --> 01:28:51,448
Oh, God. Don't let me.

994
01:28:52,326 --> 01:28:53,588
Save me!

995
01:29:57,525 --> 01:30:00,756
Help me! Father, help!

996
01:30:11,005 --> 01:30:12,529
Help, Hobson!

997
01:30:35,496 --> 01:30:38,431
Help, police!

998
01:30:39,467 --> 01:30:41,128
You stay here. I'll go ahead!

999
01:30:59,654 --> 01:31:01,087
This way, officer.

1000
01:31:01,489 --> 01:31:02,751
Stop him!

1001
01:31:11,299 --> 01:31:12,527
Stop him!

1002
01:31:28,182 --> 01:31:30,150
Help! Police!

1003
01:31:42,396 --> 01:31:44,455
This is the weapon, Doctor.

1004
01:31:47,301 --> 01:31:50,600
I know whose cane this is.
I can take you to the man.

1005
01:31:50,705 --> 01:31:52,195
Break it down!

1006
01:31:52,740 --> 01:31:54,230
Come on, Bill. Give it a shove.

1007
01:32:01,882 --> 01:32:05,750
- This one's locked, too!
- Open in the name of the law!

1008
01:32:06,854 --> 01:32:09,516
Break it down!

1009
01:32:25,206 --> 01:32:28,141
- Where is he?
- He's run out there through the back door.

1010
01:32:28,209 --> 01:32:29,335
Come on!

1011
01:32:29,910 --> 01:32:33,004
- Don't stand there staring, you fool!
- Yes, sir.

1012
01:32:42,757 --> 01:32:44,748
The door down there
is locked on the outside.

1013
01:32:44,825 --> 01:32:46,452
Then go out through the front.

1014
01:32:46,527 --> 01:32:47,721
Come on, Scobie.

1015
01:32:47,928 --> 01:32:49,589
- You stay there.
- Wait!

1016
01:32:50,331 --> 01:32:53,789
- He has escaped, sir.
- Your man has not escaped.

1017
01:33:04,645 --> 01:33:05,737
There!

1018
01:33:06,847 --> 01:33:08,838
There he is! There's your man!

1019
01:33:09,350 --> 01:33:14,117
- But, Doctor, this is impossible.
- I know it is, but there's your man!

1020
01:33:14,922 --> 01:33:18,119
- I'm sorry, sir. You appear to be serious...
- Look!

1021
01:33:36,410 --> 01:33:37,934
- Come on!
- Hold him!

1022
01:33:41,849 --> 01:33:43,817
Come on!

1023
01:33:46,921 --> 01:33:48,479
Close that door!

1024
01:33:49,990 --> 01:33:53,084
- Close that door there!
- Don't let him get away!

1025
01:33:54,728 --> 01:33:56,025
Look out!

1026
01:34:07,942 --> 01:34:10,137
- Steady, boy!
- Drop that knife!

1027
01:34:49,216 --> 01:34:50,683
Dr. Jekyll.
