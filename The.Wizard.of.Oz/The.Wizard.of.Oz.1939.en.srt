What about the heart

-And Scarecrow's brain?

1288
01:29:28,113 --> 01:29:31,992
Why, anybody can have a brain.
That's a very mediocre commodity.

1289
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:35,078
Every pusillanimous creature
that crawls on the earth...

...or slinks through slimy seas

1291
01:29:38,874 --> 01:29:41,042
Back where I come from,
we have universities...

1292
01:29:41,251 --> 01:29:44,629
...seats of great learning,
where men go to become great thinkers.

1293
01:29:44,838 --> 01:29:48,884
They think deep thoughts,
and with no more brains than you have.

1294
01:29:49,092 --> 01:29:53,054
But they have one thing
you haven't got. A diploma.

1295
01:29:53,263 --> 01:29:57,267
Therefore, by virtue
of the authority vested in me...

1296
01:29:57,475 --> 01:30:01,271
...by the Universitatus Committeeatum
E Pluribus Unum...

1297
01:30:01,479 --> 01:30:03,607
...I hereby confer upon you...

1298

-...the honorary degree of Th.D.
-Th.D.?

1299
01:30:08,987 --> 01:30:11,281
That's Doctor of Thinkology.

1300
01:30:11,531 --> 01:30:14,659
The sum of the square roots of
two sides of an isosceles triangle...

1301
01:30:14,868 --> 01:30:17,411
...is equal to the square root
of the remaining side.

1302
01:30:18,663 --> 01:30:20,582
Oh, joy! Rapture!

1303

01:30:22,709 --> 01:30:24,961
-How can I thank you enough?
-Well, you can't.

1305
01:30:25,170 --> 01:30:29,049
As for you, my fine friend, you're
a victim of disorganized thinking.

1306
01:30:29,257 --> 01:30:32,969
You are under the delusion that
because you run away from danger...

1307
01:30:33,178 --> 01:30:37,057
...you have no courage.
You're confusing courage with wisdom.

1308

Back where I come from,
we have men who are called "heroes."

their fortitude out of mothballs...

...and parade it down the main street.

1311
01:30:47,150 --> 01:30:49,319
And they have no more courage
than you have.

1312
01:30:49,527 --> 01:30:54,574
But they have one thing
that you haven't got. A medal.

...I award you the Triple Cross.

As for you, my galvanized friend,
you want a heart.

You don't know how lucky you are
not to have one.

1321
01:31:23,937 --> 01:31:28,191
Hearts will never be practical
until they can be made unbreakable.

But I still want one.

Back where I come from, there are men
who do nothing all day but good deeds.

They are called phil--

are no bigger than yours.

And remember,

by how much you love...

Auntie Em must have stopped wondering
what happened to me by now.

1400
01:35:46,032 --> 01:35:49,077
Oh, Scarecrow,
what am I going to do?

1401
01:35:50,703 --> 01:35:52,080
Look!

1402
01:35:52,497 --> 01:35:54,374
Here's someone who can help you!

1403
01:36:28,074 --> 01:36:32,120
-Will you help me? Can you help me?
-You don't need help any longer.

1404
01:36:32,328 --> 01:36:35,123
You've always had the power
to go back to Kansas.

1405
01:36:35,331 --> 01:36:38,209
-I have?
-Then why didn't you tell her before?

1406
01:36:38,418 --> 01:36:42,380
Because she wouldn't have believed me.
She had to learn it for herself.

1407
01:36:42,588 --> 01:36:45,008
What have you learned, Dorothy?

1408
01:36:45,216 --> 01:36:46,843
Well....

1409
01:36:48,344 --> 01:36:50,054
I think that it--

1410
01:36:50,263 --> 01:36:54,225
That it wasn't enough just to want
to see Uncle Henry and Auntie Em.

1411
01:36:54,434 --> 01:36:59,063
And it's that if I ever go looking
for my heart's desire again...

1412
01:36:59,272 --> 01:37:02,650
...I won't look any further
than my own back yard...

1413
01:37:02,859 --> 01:37:05,153
...because if it isn't there...

1414
01:37:05,361 --> 01:37:08,406
...I never really lost it to begin with.

1415
01:37:08,614 --> 01:37:09,741
Is that right?

1416
01:37:10,491 --> 01:37:11,659
That's all it is.

1417
01:37:11,868 --> 01:37:14,996
But that's so easy!
I should've thought of it for you.

1418
01:37:15,204 --> 01:37:18,916
-I should've felt it in my heart.
-She had to find it out for herself.

1419
01:37:19,125 --> 01:37:22,587
Now those magic slippers will
take you home in two seconds.

1420
01:37:22,795 --> 01:37:25,340
-Toto too?
-Toto too.

1421
01:37:25,548 --> 01:37:27,550
-Now?
-Whenever you wish.

1422
01:37:27,759 --> 01:37:31,262
Oh, dear.
That's too wonderful to be true!

1423
01:37:33,014 --> 01:37:34,057
Oh, it's....

1424
01:37:34,265 --> 01:37:37,685
It's gonna be so hard
to say goodbye.

1425
01:37:37,894 --> 01:37:40,271
I love you all too.

1426
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:44,567
Goodbye, Tin Man.

1427
01:37:44,776 --> 01:37:47,028
Oh, don't cry.

1428
01:37:47,236 --> 01:37:50,239
You'll rust so dreadfully.

1429
01:37:50,948 --> 01:37:54,077
Here. Here's your oilcan.

1430
01:37:55,578 --> 01:37:58,414
-Goodbye.
-Now I know I've got a heart...

1431
01:37:58,623 --> 01:38:00,708
...because it's breaking.

1432
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:07,340
Goodbye, Lion.
I know it isn't right...

1433
01:38:07,548 --> 01:38:11,260
...but I'm gonna miss the way
you used to holler for help...

1434
01:38:11,469 --> 01:38:13,930
...before you found your courage.

1435
01:38:14,138 --> 01:38:18,226
I would never have found it
if it hadn't been for you.

1436
01:38:22,939 --> 01:38:26,025
I think I'll miss you most of all.

1437
01:38:30,947 --> 01:38:34,075
-Are you ready now?
-Yes.

1438
01:38:35,701 --> 01:38:37,954
Say goodbye, Toto.

1439
01:38:40,498 --> 01:38:44,168
-Yes, I'm ready now.
-Then close your eyes...

1440
01:38:44,377 --> 01:38:47,380
...and tap your heels
together three times...

1441
01:38:49,549 --> 01:38:51,551
...and think to yourself:

1442
01:38:51,759 --> 01:38:54,720
"There's no place like home.

1443
01:38:54,928 --> 01:38:58,224
There's no place like home."

1444
01:38:58,433 --> 01:39:01,935
There's no place like home.

1445
01:39:02,145 --> 01:39:05,648
There's no place like home.

1446
01:39:06,107 --> 01:39:07,775
There's no place like home.

1447
01:39:09,152 --> 01:39:11,028
There's no place like home.

1448
01:39:13,072 --> 01:39:14,824
There's no place like home.

1449
01:39:19,245 --> 01:39:20,954
There's no place like home.

1450
01:39:21,747 --> 01:39:23,916
There's no place like home.

1451
01:39:26,043 --> 01:39:28,754
AUNTIE EM: Wake up, honey.
-There's no place like home.

1452
01:39:29,839 --> 01:39:32,341
There's no place like home.

1453
01:39:34,302 --> 01:39:36,095
There's no....

1454
01:39:38,890 --> 01:39:42,351
Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.

1455
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:44,604
Oh, Auntie Em, it's you!

1456
01:39:44,812 --> 01:39:47,773
-Yes, darling.
PROFESSOR: Hello there! Anybody home?

1457
01:39:47,981 --> 01:39:51,611
I dropped by because I heard
the little girl got caught in the big--

1458
01:39:51,819 --> 01:39:55,573
-Well, she seems all right now.
-She got quite a bump on the head.

1459
01:39:55,781 --> 01:39:58,284
We kind of thought
she was gonna leave us.

1460
01:39:58,493 --> 01:40:01,162
But I did leave you.
That's just the trouble.

1461
01:40:01,370 --> 01:40:03,331
And I tried to get back for days!

1462
01:40:03,539 --> 01:40:05,458
There, there, lie quiet now.

1463
01:40:05,666 --> 01:40:08,711
-You just had a bad dream.
-Sure.

1464
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:10,463
Remember me...

1465
01:40:10,671 --> 01:40:12,882
...your old pal, Hunk?

1466
01:40:13,090 --> 01:40:15,676
And me, Hickory?

1467
01:40:15,885 --> 01:40:17,678
You couldn't forget my face,
could you?

1468
01:40:17,887 --> 01:40:21,599
No. But it wasn't a dream.
It was a place.

1469
01:40:21,807 --> 01:40:24,435
And you and you and you...

1470
01:40:24,644 --> 01:40:26,562
...and you were there.

1471
01:40:27,813 --> 01:40:29,524
But you couldn't have been,
could you?

1472
01:40:29,732 --> 01:40:32,025
AUNTIE EM: We dream lots
of silly things when we--

1473
01:40:32,235 --> 01:40:35,988
No, Aunt Em, this was
a real, truly live place.

1474
01:40:36,197 --> 01:40:39,242
And I remember that some of it
wasn't very nice...

1475
01:40:39,450 --> 01:40:41,369
...but most of it was beautiful.

1476
01:40:41,577 --> 01:40:45,414
But just the same, all I kept saying
to everybody was, "I want to go home!"

1477
01:40:45,623 --> 01:40:47,708
And they sent me home.

1478
01:40:48,084 --> 01:40:49,335
[ALL CHUCKLING]

1479
01:40:49,544 --> 01:40:51,337
Doesn't anybody believe me?

1480
01:40:51,546 --> 01:40:53,589
Of course we believe you, Dorothy.

1481
01:40:53,798 --> 01:40:56,259
But anyway, Toto, we're home!

1482
01:40:56,467 --> 01:40:59,262
Home! And this is my room...

1483
01:40:59,470 --> 01:41:01,013
...and you're all here.

1484
01:41:01,222 --> 01:41:04,392
And I'm not going to leave here
ever, ever again...

1485
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:06,519
...because I love you all.

1486
01:41:06,727 --> 01:41:10,147
And oh, Auntie Em...

1487
01:41:10,356 --> 01:41:13,401
...there's no place like home!
