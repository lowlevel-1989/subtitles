00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:03,272
<i>Put your faith
in what you most believe in</i>

00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:07,860
<i>Two worlds
One family</i>

00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:11,655
<i>Trust your heart,
Let fate decide</i>

4
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:16,201
<i>To guide these lives we see</i>

5
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:20,873
<i>A paradise
untouched by man</i>

6
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:24,668
<i>Within this world
blessed with love</i>

7
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:29,715
<i>A simple life
They live in peace</i>

8
00:01:29,882 --> 00:01:34,178
<i>Softly tread the sand
below your feet now</i>

9
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:37,890

<i>Beneath the shelter
of the trees</i>

13
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:56,241
<i>Only love can enter here</i>

14
00:01:56,408 --> 00:02:00,537
<i>A simple life

<i>Take strength
from those that need you</i>

17
00:02:08,504 --> 00:02:12,758
<i>Build high the walls
Build strong the beams</i>

18
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:19,097
<i>A new life is waiting
But danger's no stranger here</i>

19
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:47,584
<i>No words describe
a mother's tears</i>

20
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:52,798
<i>No words can heal

00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:56,260
<i>A dream is gone

22
00:02:56,426 --> 00:03:00,973

is calling for you</i>

00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,434

<i>To guide these lives we see</i>

26
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:55,546
- Huh?
- Eh?

27
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:03,554
Achoo!

28
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:20,732
Anh-anh-anh-anh...

29
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:55,184
<i>Every moment now
the bond grows stronger</i>

30
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:58,687
<i>Two worlds, one family</i>

31
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:03,108

33
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:20,334
Mommy, look!
Look over there!

34
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:22,294
- Kala!
- She's back!

35
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:29,343
Are you all right,
dear?

36
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,136
I'm fine.
No, really, honestly.

37
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:34,890
It's just that I got
a little bit... sidetracked.

38
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:39,853
Well, isn't that, uh...
Well, so...

39
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,940
Well,
it's just so, so...

40
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:45,400
That's freaky-lookin', okay?
That's what it is.

41
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,402
- Terkina!
- Well, it is!

42
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:51,198
- I mean, what the heck is it anyway?
- He's a baby.

43
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:54,785
Ow! I can't...

44
00:08:56,245 --> 00:08:59,540
So, where's his mama?

45
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:02,918
Well, I'm going to be
his mother now.

46
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:11,426
You know, he's not so bad
once you get used to him.

47
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:15,472
Kala's gonna be its mother now.

48
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:23,522
Kerchak, I saved him from Sabor.

49
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:29,403
Kala, it won't replace
the one we lost.

50
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:33,407
I know that.
But... he needs me.

51
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:38,245
But, it-it-it...
Kala, look at it.

52
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:40,622
It's not our kind.

53
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:44,585
No. You have to take it back.

54
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,462
Take him back?
But he'll die!

55
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:49,756
- If the jungle wants him...
- I want him.

56
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,134
Kala, I cannot let you put
our family in danger.

57
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:54,970
Does he look dangerous to you?

58
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:05,898
Hmm. Was it alone?

59
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:08,400
Yes.
Sabor killed his family.

60
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:12,571
- Are you sure?
- Yes. There are no others.

61
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,867
Then you may keep him.

62
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:22,456
- Kerchak, I know he'll be a good son.
- I said he could stay.

63
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,417
That doesn't make him
my son.

64
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:30,672
We will nest here
for the night.

65
00:10:35,928 --> 00:10:38,597
So, um,
whatcha gonna call it?

66
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:42,476
I'm gonna call him...
Tarzan.

67
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:46,188
Tarzan? Okay.
He's your baby.

68
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:49,483
All right, little lady, come on.
It's way past your nest time.

69
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,527
- Oh, Mom, five more minutes?
- No!

70
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:53,862
- Two more minutes?
- No!

71
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:56,698
One more "minutes"?

72
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:02,454
Oh, no, no, no.

73
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:06,166
Shh, shh, shh. Don't cry. I'm here.

74
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,836
Come on, come on.

75
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:13,507
<i>Come, stop your crying
It'll be all right</i>

76
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:18,804
<i>Just take my hand
Hold it tight</i>

77
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:23,642
<i>I will protect you
from all around you</i>

78
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:28,730
<i>I will be here
Don't you cry</i>

79
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:33,986
<i>For one so small
You seem so strong</i>

80
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:38,156
<i>My arms will hold you
Keep you safe and warm</i>

81
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:43,787
<i>This bond between us
can't be broken</i>

82
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:47,875
<i>I will be here
Don't you cry</i>

83
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:52,546
<i>'Cause you'll be in my heart</i>

84
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:56,633
<i>Yes, you'll be in my heart</i>

85
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:03,473
<i>From this day on
Now and forever more</i>

86
00:12:07,603 --> 00:12:11,857
<i>You'll be in my heart</i>

87
00:12:12,024 --> 00:12:16,695
<i>No matter what they say</i>

88
00:12:16,862 --> 00:12:21,408
<i>You'll be here in my heart</i>

89
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:24,119
<i>Always</i>

90
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:30,417
<i>Always</i>

91
00:13:01,073 --> 00:13:05,244
- I sure scared you, Mom. Whoa.
- You sure did!

92
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,704
Can't you imitate
any quieter animals?

93
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:11,250
Oh, Mom, they're no fun.
Wanna see me be a leopard?

94
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:16,380
Why don't you just
come up with your own sound?

95
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,429
Kala!

96
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:31,937
Oops.

97
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:33,939
Hee-hee.

98
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:36,441
Tarzan, thank goodness
you're all right!

99
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:40,320
Kala and I have been
so worried!

100
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:43,740
Thank you. Thank you so much
for finding him, Kerchak.

101
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:46,285
You are such a wise
and caring leader.

102
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:48,495
Run.

103
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:50,956
Ooh!
Um...

104
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:56,461
- Hello! Are you thick in the head?
- What?

105
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:58,297
How many times
do I have to tell ya?

106
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:02,092
If you want Kerchak to like you,
stay away from him!

107
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:04,469
- Come on, Terk! Step on it!
- Last one there's a dung beetle!

108
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:08,265
- Yeah! And the first one's gotta eat it!
- Terk, can I come?

109
00:14:08,432 --> 00:14:12,561
Well, yeah, you could if you could keep
up, but... you can't really keep up.

110
00:14:12,728 --> 00:14:16,732
Wait up, guys.
Wait up! Right behind ya.

111
00:14:25,616 --> 00:14:28,285
Ah, yeah, take that.
Stop hitting yourself.

112
00:14:28,452 --> 00:14:32,247
Stop hitting yourself!
Stop hitting yourself!

113
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:36,293
<i>The fun has arrived</i>
Thank you very much.

114
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,961
What took you
so long?

115
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:42,674
I had a little pest control problem,
but it's all taken care of.

116
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:45,010
Hi, guys.

117
00:14:45,177 --> 00:14:48,263
Terk, what is this?
Some kind of joke?

118
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,807
Tell me I'm not lookin'
at the hairless wonder.

119
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:53,769
Terk said I could come along
if I could keep up.

120
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:57,523
- Ah, no, Terk, come on!
- Terk!

121
00:14:57,606 --> 00:15:00,108
I'll handle this, guys.
Okay?

122
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:01,818
Listen, buddy, come here.

123
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:04,655
We got a tiny,
little, itsy-bitsy problem here.

124
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:07,574
Personally, I'd love to hang out
with you. You know I would.

125
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:10,828
But the guys, they need
a little convincing, you know.

126
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:12,538
Okay.
What do I gotta do?

127
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:16,834
Do? What do you gotta do?
It's so stupid!

128
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,798
- What?
- Well, you gotta... You gotta go get a hair.

129
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:23,632
A hair?

130
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:27,469
Yeah, a hair.

131
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:29,888
An elephant hair.

132
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:36,520
An elephant hair?

133
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:39,106
Like I said,
it's stupid, right?

134
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:41,733
Listen, take it from me.
Go home, okay?

135
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:46,530
Who needs this aggravation? You know?
I'm probably gonna leave soon myself.

136
00:15:46,697 --> 00:15:49,533
You go, I'll catch up.
All right?

137
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:53,537
You see? Leave it to me.
I told ya... Tarzan!

138
00:15:53,704 --> 00:15:55,998
Tarzan, no!

139
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:06,592
That one hurt him.

140
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:25,068
Look!

141
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:29,239
- Oh, oh, there he is! He's alive!
- Hey, guys!

142
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:31,033
Hi!

143
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,453
Oh, no. No, no, no!

144
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:37,831
Come back!
Come back!

145
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:41,627
This guy's great! If he lives,
you should bring him around more often.

146
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:45,088
- Come on, let's go get a better seat.
- Ohh.

147
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:50,469
- You never get enough sleep.
- I get enough sleep.

148
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:55,265
Mom, are you sure
this water's sanitary?

149
00:16:55,474 --> 00:16:58,393
It looks questionable to me.

150
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,521
It's fine, honey.

151
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:05,108
Yech!
But what about bacteria?

152
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:08,612
Tantor, can't you see
Mommy's talking?

153
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:17,496
Watch out! There's something
swimming! It's coming right at you!

154
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,498
Honey, Mommy's losing
her patience.

155
00:17:19,665 --> 00:17:23,502
- But this time I really see something!
- Oh, boy.

156
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:26,129
Piranha! It's a piranha!

157
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:29,925
Sweetheart, there are
no piranhas in Africa.

158
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:33,512
Don't tell the kid that. Of course
there are piranhas in Africa.

159
00:17:33,595 --> 00:17:36,014
No, she's right.
They're native to South America.

160
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:37,683
Get outta here.

161
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:41,353
No way! Come on. Do you think
I'd be standing here if...

162
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:43,730
Aah! It's right behind you!
Run!

163
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:48,402
For the last time, honey, there
are no piranhas in...

164
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:49,945
My butt!

165
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:53,365
- I told you!
- There's something on my butt.

166
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:55,242
- What is it?
- Are there any more of them?

167
00:17:56,034 --> 00:18:00,914
- What is it?
- It's a piranha!

168
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:03,208
Huh?

169
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:06,712
Piranha!

170
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:11,091
Tantor, where are...

171
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:24,021
He's dead!

172
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:26,023
We're dead!

173
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:34,865
We didn't do it!
They're the ones!

174
00:18:52,758 --> 00:18:55,093
Oh, thank you, Kerchak.

175
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,391
Tarzan, buddy! Buddy, come on.
Tarzan, don't die on me.

176
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:04,186
Don't die on me.
You weren't supposed to do it!

177
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:08,190
Get away from there! Don't you know a
piranha can strip your flesh in seconds?

178
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:11,318
What? He's not a piranha!
He's...

179
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:13,570
He's alive!

180
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:16,782
- He's alive! He's alive!
- He's alive!

181
00:19:16,949 --> 00:19:19,618
He's alive...
You idiot!

182
00:19:19,785 --> 00:19:23,455
You nearly gave me a heart
attack. Ya happy?

183
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:27,251
You... I don't believe it.
You got the hair?

184
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:32,005
Is that what this is all about?
I got a whole tail of them.

185
00:19:32,965 --> 00:19:34,007
- Tarzan!
- Terkina!

186
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:35,592
Oh, no!

187
00:19:36,385 --> 00:19:38,428
- Who's that?
- My mom.

188
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:41,557
- Tarzan!
- Hi, Aunt Kala.

189
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:44,643
- Oh, you scared me! What happened?
- Well, I...

190
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:48,605
It's sort of a long...
It's involved because what happened...

191
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:50,774
- It was a weird...
- What happened?

192
00:19:53,402 --> 00:19:56,572
- It was my fault, Kerchak.
- Tarzan!

193
00:19:56,738 --> 00:20:01,410
We were playing and well...
I'm... I'm sorry, Kerchak.

194
00:20:01,577 --> 00:20:03,579
You almost killed someone!

195
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:05,789
- But it was an accident.
- He's only a child.

196
00:20:05,956 --> 00:20:08,417
That's no excuse, Kala!
You can't keep defending him!

197
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,960
- But he'll learn!
- He will never learn!

198
00:20:10,127 --> 00:20:13,213
- You can't learn to be one of us.
- Because you never give him a chance!

199
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:18,594
Give him a chance? Kala, look at him.
He will never be one of us.

200
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,846
Kerchak!

201
00:20:21,013 --> 00:20:23,265
Tarzan!

202
00:21:13,524 --> 00:21:15,817
Tarzan,
what are you doing?

203
00:21:16,485 --> 00:21:18,487
Why am I so different?

204
00:21:18,654 --> 00:21:20,697
Because you're covered
with mud. That's why.

205
00:21:20,864 --> 00:21:24,660
- No! Kerchak said I didn't
belong in the... - Close your mouth.

206
00:21:24,743 --> 00:21:26,245
Said I don't belong
in the family.

207
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:29,748
Never mind what Kerchak said.
Now, hold still!

208
00:21:29,915 --> 00:21:31,750
But, look at me!

209
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:38,257
I am, Tarzan.
And do you know what I see?

210
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:41,426
I see two eyes,
like mine.

211
00:21:41,593 --> 00:21:44,930
And a nose...
somewhere.

212
00:21:45,097 --> 00:21:47,766
Ahh... here!

213
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:50,394
Two ears!

214
00:21:51,103 --> 00:21:53,772
- And, let's see. What else?
- Two hands?

215
00:21:53,939 --> 00:21:55,774
That's right.

216
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:14,376
Close your eyes.

217
00:22:14,543 --> 00:22:18,755
Now forget what you see.
What do you feel?

218
00:22:20,465 --> 00:22:21,550
My heart.

219
00:22:22,134 --> 00:22:23,218
Come here.

220
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:27,306
- Your heart.
- See?

221
00:22:27,472 --> 00:22:31,351
We're exactly the same.

222
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:35,189
Oh!
Kerchak just can't see that.

223
00:22:37,733 --> 00:22:39,234
I'll make him see it!

224
00:22:39,484 --> 00:22:41,653
I'll be the best ape ever!

225
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:45,282
Oh, I bet you will.

226
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,548
<i>Oh, the power to be strong</i>

227
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:05,427
<i>And the wisdom
to be wise</i>

228
00:23:05,594 --> 00:23:10,182
<i>All these things
will come to you in time</i>

229
00:23:11,475 --> 00:23:14,728
<i>On this journey
that you're making</i>

230
00:23:14,895 --> 00:23:18,190
<i>There'll be answers
that you'll seek</i>

231
00:23:18,482 --> 00:23:21,401
<i>And it's you who'll climb
the mountain</i>

232
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:25,155
<i>It's you who'll reach
the peak</i>

233
00:23:26,073 --> 00:23:29,117
<i>Son of man
look to the sky</i>

234
00:23:29,284 --> 00:23:32,371
<i>Lift your spirit
Set it free</i>

235
00:23:32,538 --> 00:23:35,833
<i>Some day you'll walk tall
with pride</i>

236
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:41,171
<i>Son of man
A man in time you'll be</i>

237
00:23:51,932 --> 00:23:55,310
<i>Though there's no one there
to guide you</i>

238
00:23:55,477 --> 00:23:59,606
<i>No one to take your hand</i>

239
00:23:59,773 --> 00:24:02,359
<i>But with faith
and understanding</i>

240
00:24:02,526 --> 00:24:06,530
<i>You will journey
from boy to man</i>

241
00:24:06,697 --> 00:24:09,116
<i>Son of man
look to the sky</i>

242
00:24:09,283 --> 00:24:13,078
<i>Lift your spirit
Set it free</i>

243
00:24:13,245 --> 00:24:16,248
<i>Some day you'll walk tall
with pride</i>

244
00:24:16,415 --> 00:24:22,129
<i>Son of man
A man in time you'll be</i>

245
00:24:27,134 --> 00:24:29,136
<i>In learning
you will teach</i>

246
00:24:29,303 --> 00:24:33,182
<i>And in teaching
you will learn</i>

247
00:24:33,348 --> 00:24:37,895
<i>You'll find your place
beside the ones you love</i>

248
00:24:39,354 --> 00:24:43,567
<i>All and all
the things you've dreamed of</i>

249
00:24:43,734 --> 00:24:46,653
<i>The visions that you saw</i>

250
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:50,073
<i>Well, the time
is drawing near now</i>

251
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,702
<i>It's yours to claim it all</i>

252
00:24:53,869 --> 00:24:57,372
<i>Son of man
look to the sky</i>

253
00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:00,751
<i>Lift your spirit
Set it free</i>

254
00:25:00,918 --> 00:25:03,962
<i>Some day you'll walk tall
with pride</i>

255
00:25:04,129 --> 00:25:09,301
<i>Son of man
A man in time you'll be</i>

256
00:25:16,308 --> 00:25:22,606
<i>Son of man
Son of man's a man for all to see</i>

257
00:25:40,624 --> 00:25:42,876
Don't even think
about it.

258
00:25:44,336 --> 00:25:47,422
- How'd you know it was me?
- I'm your mother. I know everything.

259
00:25:47,506 --> 00:25:50,551
- Where have you been?
- I thought you knew everything.

260
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:55,848
Hey, Auntie "K."
You're looking remarkably groomed today.

261
00:25:55,931 --> 00:25:57,015
Hello, Terk.

262
00:25:57,182 --> 00:26:00,227
Not the neck.
Not the neck there, "T."

263
00:26:06,567 --> 00:26:10,153
Whoa! Okay. It's all fun and games
till someone loses an eye.

264
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,198
Please stop.
Somebody's gonna get hurt.

265
00:26:13,282 --> 00:26:15,701
- And it's always me. Please.
- Cramp in the calf!

266
00:26:15,868 --> 00:26:20,080
Okay, you win! Ow, ow!
Okay! You win. Hello?

267
00:26:20,372 --> 00:26:22,207
Yo, yo, let go!

268
00:26:22,749 --> 00:26:25,252
- Oh, sorry, Terk.
- What kind of animal are you?

269
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:26,712
I've been thinking lately that.

270
00:26:26,795 --> 00:26:29,673
Maybe Tarzan could be
some subspecies of elephant.

271
00:26:29,923 --> 00:26:31,884
What, are you crazy?
An elephant?

272
00:26:32,134 --> 00:26:34,845
Listen to me.
Think about it. He enjoys a peanut.

273
00:26:35,012 --> 00:26:38,098
- I enjoy a peanut.
- He looks nothing like you!

274
00:29:26,058 --> 00:29:28,185
Okay, everybody, move aside.
Outta my way!

275
00:29:28,352 --> 00:29:31,188
Best friend comin' through.
That would be me.

276
00:29:31,355 --> 00:29:33,690
And you, don't make
a habit of that, okay?

277
00:29:33,857 --> 00:29:36,109
There are other ways
of gettin' attention. You know?

278
00:29:36,276 --> 00:29:38,654
- I'll try to remember that.
- All right.

279
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,739
I was right behind ya
if you needed me.

280
00:30:19,069 --> 00:30:20,320
What was that?

281
00:30:20,487 --> 00:30:23,157
Ayah, it wasn't me.
I swear!

282
00:30:23,282 --> 00:30:25,909
- Okay, maybe it was.
- Everyone!

283
00:30:26,118 --> 00:30:27,953
Let's move.

284
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:19,338
This reminds me
of the safari I led up the Zambezi.

285
00:31:22,466 --> 00:31:23,509
...Back, back,
back, back, back.

286
00:31:23,675 --> 00:31:26,011
Ooh, was it scary there.

287
00:31:26,178 --> 00:31:31,266
Two men with only three rifles.
We blasted away.

288
00:31:31,433 --> 00:31:34,478
That's when I knew
I was born for Africa!

289
00:31:34,645 --> 00:31:38,482
And Africa
was created for...

290
00:31:45,989 --> 00:31:47,115
Clayton!

291
00:31:48,325 --> 00:31:49,701
Clayton!
Oh, there you are.

292
00:31:49,785 --> 00:31:52,830
What is it? What is it, Clayton?
Are we in danger?

293
00:31:52,913 --> 00:31:54,957
I thought I saw something.

294
00:31:55,123 --> 00:31:58,168
Is it a Hippopotamus Amphibious,
or a Rhinoceros Bihornus?

295
00:31:58,252 --> 00:32:00,838
- Professor, don't move!
- Ah, right.

296
00:32:01,004 --> 00:32:01,797
Daddy?

297
00:32:04,466 --> 00:32:07,594
Daddy, what's all
the hullabaloo about? Aah!

298
00:32:11,181 --> 00:32:11,974
What is it, Daddy?

299
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:15,269
Mr Clayton asked me not to move.
He saw something.

300
00:32:17,437 --> 00:32:19,857
Oh, I moved.

301
00:32:20,023 --> 00:32:23,068
Ah, Mr Clayton, sorry.
Excuse me, uh...

302
00:32:23,235 --> 00:32:26,405
But my father and I came on
this expedition to study gorillas.

303
00:32:26,947 --> 00:32:29,783
I believe your shooting
might be scaring them off.

304
00:32:29,867 --> 00:32:34,079
You hired me to protect you,
Miss Porter, and protect you I shall.

305
00:32:34,246 --> 00:32:36,540
And you're doing
a marvellous job of it.

306
00:32:36,707 --> 00:32:40,127
We only have a short time before
the ship returns...

307
00:32:40,294 --> 00:32:44,214
Jane! Jane, do you realize
what you're standing in?

308
00:32:44,381 --> 00:32:46,258
- A gorilla's nest!
- Oh, Daddy!

309
00:32:46,425 --> 00:32:50,137
At last,
our first sign in days!

310
00:32:50,304 --> 00:32:52,723
Do you think the beasts
could be nearby?

311
00:32:52,806 --> 00:32:53,473
Could be.

312
00:32:53,557 --> 00:32:58,312
There's the evidence.
Not very far, anyway.

313
00:32:58,395 --> 00:32:59,354
Daddy, look!
Over there and there!

314
00:32:59,438 --> 00:33:01,440
Where? Oh, yes,
more nests! I see them!

315
00:33:01,607 --> 00:33:04,651
- Just as you predicted.
- Whole family groups!

316
00:33:04,735 --> 00:33:06,904
Jane, I love you!

317
00:33:08,489 --> 00:33:12,868
Family groups? Excuse me,
but these are wild beasts...

318
00:33:13,035 --> 00:33:15,078
that would sooner tear your head off
than look at you.

319
00:33:15,245 --> 00:33:20,000
On the contrary. Daddy's theory
is that these are social creatures...

320
00:33:25,589 --> 00:33:28,634
Mr. Clayton, please.
What if it's a gorilla?

321
00:33:28,926 --> 00:33:31,637
It's no gorilla.

322
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,351
- But we should press on.
- Yes, indeed.

323
00:33:37,518 --> 00:33:41,104
We should keep heading west
following the Ganoderma Ablonatum.

324
00:33:41,271 --> 00:33:45,108
Excellent, Professor! I could've used
your expertise on my last safari.

325
00:33:53,325 --> 00:33:55,994
Are you what all the fuss
was about?

326
00:33:56,662 --> 00:33:59,122
Daddy!
Daddy, quick!

327
00:33:59,748 --> 00:34:01,291
No, wait, wait.
Hold still.

328
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:03,377
Oh, my.
Oh, my good...

329
00:34:03,544 --> 00:34:05,671
You may not be a gorilla,

330
00:34:05,838 --> 00:34:07,923
but you are one sweet little...

331
00:34:11,051 --> 00:34:13,971
Huh. There you go.
What do you think?

332
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,434
What? Oh!

333
00:34:20,269 --> 00:34:21,937
Why, you little...

334
00:34:22,104 --> 00:34:25,065
Well, this is
absolutely peachy!

335
00:34:25,232 --> 00:34:29,528
Come to study gorillas, and get
my sketchbook pinched by a baboon!

336
00:34:37,202 --> 00:34:38,495
Give me that!

337
00:34:40,497 --> 00:34:44,251
Come on now, enough of this.
I want this paper on the count of three.

338
00:34:44,418 --> 00:34:47,546
One, two...

339
00:34:47,713 --> 00:34:49,798
Oh, look, bananas!

340
00:34:52,426 --> 00:34:54,887
I can't believe you fell for that one!

341
00:34:55,512 --> 00:34:58,724
No, no, don't give me those crocodile tears.

342
00:34:58,891 --> 00:35:01,393
What would your parents have to say?

343
00:35:03,687 --> 00:35:06,982
Oh! See, I told you
they'd be cross.

344
00:35:07,149 --> 00:35:10,277
Go easy on him.
Children will be children.

345
00:35:28,879 --> 00:35:32,925
Oh! I'm flying!
What on earth am I...

346
00:35:36,762 --> 00:35:38,639
Get off! Get off!

347
00:35:43,227 --> 00:35:45,938
Oh! Put me down!
Put me down!

348
00:35:46,897 --> 00:35:48,815
No! Pick me up, pick me up!

349
00:36:17,219 --> 00:36:19,429
Unhand me!

350
00:36:38,657 --> 00:36:39,741
Ah, over there!

351
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:33,086
I'm in a tree with a man
who talks to monkeys.

352
00:37:33,253 --> 00:37:35,797
Ooh, I can't do this!
I can't... Oh!

353
00:37:35,964 --> 00:37:38,634
This is good.
This is... very good.

354
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,971
Wait. One, two...

355
00:37:46,225 --> 00:37:49,478
It can't get any worse, can it?

356
00:37:51,522 --> 00:37:53,899
Obviously, it can.

357
00:37:56,527 --> 00:38:02,157
Ahh... no! Oh!

358
00:38:02,324 --> 00:38:06,286
Stay back. No, don't.
Don't come any closer. Please, don't.

359
00:38:06,453 --> 00:38:08,956
What are... What are you doing?

360
00:38:09,122 --> 00:38:12,376
Please don't.
That tickles.

361
00:38:12,543 --> 00:38:14,127
No, get off, get off...
Get off!

362
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,380
It serves you right.

363
00:38:16,463 --> 00:38:21,093
Stay away from me like
a very good wild man. You, stay.

364
00:38:21,218 --> 00:38:23,762
I'm warning you.
My father won't take kindly to you...

365
00:38:23,929 --> 00:38:27,099
No. That's...
Now, that's close enough.

366
00:38:27,975 --> 00:38:30,936
How dare you? Wha...

367
00:39:16,273 --> 00:39:20,527
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear, oh, dear. Oh, dear!

368
00:39:20,694 --> 00:39:25,532
Yes, thank you. It's a lovely heartbeat.
It's very nice.

369
00:39:27,284 --> 00:39:29,161
It's very nice.

370
00:39:29,328 --> 00:39:32,664
Oh, thank you. I can't do a thing
with it in this humidity though. It's...

371
00:39:32,789 --> 00:39:35,000
You...
You do speak.

372
00:39:35,167 --> 00:39:38,712
And all this time I thought you were just
a big, wild, quiet, silent person-thing.

373
00:39:38,879 --> 00:39:42,925
Why didn't you tell me? I must say I'm
rather curious as to who you are. I'd love...

374
00:39:44,259 --> 00:39:46,929
Tarzan.

375
00:39:51,266 --> 00:39:53,060
Tarzan.

376
00:39:54,353 --> 00:39:55,812
Tarzan.

377
00:39:59,566 --> 00:40:00,859
Oh, I see!

378
00:40:01,026 --> 00:40:03,028
Oh, I see!

379
00:40:03,195 --> 00:40:04,947
Tarzan.

380
00:40:05,113 --> 00:40:06,990
Oh, I see.

381
00:40:07,241 --> 00:40:09,576
No, no, no.
No.

382
00:40:10,953 --> 00:40:12,037
I'm Jane.

383
00:40:12,996 --> 00:40:16,708
No, no, no. No.
I'm Jane.

384
00:40:17,626 --> 00:40:22,339
No, no.
Jane. Tarzan.

385
00:40:22,506 --> 00:40:24,842
Jane.

386
00:40:25,008 --> 00:40:28,178
- Jane.
- Exactly.

387
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,597
Clayton!

388
00:40:34,518 --> 00:40:35,686
Clayton!

389
00:40:35,853 --> 00:40:37,688
Extraordinary!

390
00:40:37,855 --> 00:40:42,693
Um, please,
can you take me to my camp?

391
00:40:43,861 --> 00:40:46,238
Yes! Clayton!
Wonderful!

392
00:40:46,697 --> 00:40:51,326
Um, could we...
Um, can't we walk?

393
00:40:51,535 --> 00:40:54,329
Can't we walk?

394
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:58,292
- Tarzan!
- Tarzan, where are ya?

395
00:40:58,458 --> 00:41:01,336
- Tarzan!
- Let's hope we find him before Kerchak does.

396
00:41:01,503 --> 00:41:03,589
- Maybe he's lost.
- Or found something more interesting.

397
00:41:03,755 --> 00:41:06,258
What, are you nuts? What could be
more interesting than us?

398
00:41:08,427 --> 00:41:10,470
Hey! What's everybody lookin' at?

399
00:41:16,852 --> 00:41:20,689
The horror!
It's gruesome! Hide me!

400
00:41:20,772 --> 00:41:23,233
Pull yourself together.
You're embarrassing me.

401
00:41:23,901 --> 00:41:27,821
- These things aren't alive.
- I knew that.

402
00:41:27,988 --> 00:41:31,325
- Tarzan?
- Tarzan? - Tarzan?

403
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:33,285
Hello?

404
00:41:34,244 --> 00:41:38,665
What kind of primitive beasts
are responsible for this mess?

405
00:41:46,215 --> 00:41:49,510
Wow! Come here, you guys! Come here,
come here, come here. Look at this!

406
00:41:49,676 --> 00:41:51,929
- What is that? Funny. Wow, it's...
- What is that thing?

407
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:01,647
Hey, do it again.
Do it again.

408
00:42:02,773 --> 00:42:03,857
Like this?

409
00:42:05,484 --> 00:42:06,527
Yeah!

410
00:42:08,278 --> 00:42:10,113
Yeah, rip it!

411
00:42:12,491 --> 00:42:13,492
I love that part!

412
00:42:15,035 --> 00:42:17,454
Let me hear it, big fella.

413
00:42:17,955 --> 00:42:19,164
Now, hit it!

414
00:42:22,417 --> 00:42:23,210
Yeah!

415
00:42:26,505 --> 00:42:27,548
Nice!

416
00:42:29,424 --> 00:42:31,134
What the heck?
Bye-bye.

417
00:42:31,218 --> 00:42:32,052
Terk!

418
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:35,097
- Yeah, Tant?
- Hmm?

419
00:42:35,264 --> 00:42:38,684
Now! Hit it!
Come on, Tantor!

420
00:42:39,852 --> 00:42:42,521
Oh, I love it!

421
00:42:42,688 --> 00:42:46,441
Stay with me, fellas.
I feel somethin' happenin' here.

422
00:43:20,267 --> 00:43:21,059
Yeah!

423
00:44:14,279 --> 00:44:15,614
Gorillas!

424
00:44:23,705 --> 00:44:25,415
He's one of them!

425
00:44:48,063 --> 00:44:49,481
Oh, my...

426
00:45:24,433 --> 00:45:27,561
- Jane!Jane!
- Jane!

427
00:45:29,479 --> 00:45:32,399
Jane, where are you?

428
00:45:32,566 --> 00:45:35,819
Jane! Oh, Jane!
Oh, thank goodness.

429
00:45:35,903 --> 00:45:37,446
Good heavens,
what happened?

430
00:45:37,529 --> 00:45:39,907
Are you all right? We've been
everywhere looking for you. I...

431
00:45:40,073 --> 00:45:43,452
Oh, my goodness! Daddy!
I was out walking.

432
00:45:43,702 --> 00:45:45,245
- I was...
- Yes, yes.

433
00:45:45,329 --> 00:45:47,122
Little baby monkey.

434
00:45:47,206 --> 00:45:48,290
- I drew a picture.
- Yes, go on.

435
00:45:48,457 --> 00:45:50,501
- Suddenly the monkey starts crying.
- Oh, poor thing.

436
00:45:50,667 --> 00:45:53,795
- I turned 'round and there's a
whole fleet of them! - Of what?

437
00:45:53,879 --> 00:45:57,007
- There's an army of monkeys. A huge tree
full of them. - Monkeys? Monkeys!

438
00:45:57,549 --> 00:45:59,468
Screaming at me!

439
00:45:59,635 --> 00:46:01,720
- That's Theripithicus Baboonus.
She's very good at this. - Oh, really?

440
00:46:01,887 --> 00:46:04,556
Terrified I was. And suddenly, I was swinging

441
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,351
- in the vines.
- With the monkeys, yes?

442
00:46:07,434 --> 00:46:09,436
- Swinging, flying. I was in the air.
- In the air, yes, I know.

443
00:46:09,603 --> 00:46:11,230
- And I'm all surrounded.
- What did you do?

444
00:46:11,313 --> 00:46:13,565
Daddy, they took my boot.

445
00:46:13,649 --> 00:46:15,651
They took... Those are
the ones I bought you.

446
00:46:15,734 --> 00:46:20,739
And I was saved! I was saved
by a flying wild man in a loin cloth.

447
00:46:20,823 --> 00:46:23,075
- Loin cloth? Good Lord.
- What is she talking about?

448
00:46:23,242 --> 00:46:26,537
I haven't the foggiest idea.
Takes after her mother, you know.

449
00:46:26,703 --> 00:46:29,706
She'd come up with stories like that.
Not about men in loin cloths, of course.

450
00:46:29,873 --> 00:46:31,959
- And there were gorillas.
- Gorillas?

451
00:46:32,125 --> 00:46:33,585
- They were doing...
- You saw the gorillas?

452
00:46:33,669 --> 00:46:35,462
Where, Jane, where?

453
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:37,589
He left with them.

454
00:46:37,673 --> 00:46:39,049
Who, dear, who?

455
00:46:40,008 --> 00:46:41,510
Tarzan.

456
00:46:41,677 --> 00:46:45,639
- Tarzan?
- The ape man.

457
00:46:48,892 --> 00:46:51,603
Everyone, we will avoid
the strangers.

458
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:54,314
Do not let them see you,
and do not seek them out.

459
00:46:54,398 --> 00:46:55,607
They mean us no harm, Kerchak.

460
00:46:55,691 --> 00:46:58,652
- Tarzan, I don't know that.
- But I do. I've spent time with them.

461
00:46:58,819 --> 00:47:01,321
You may be willing to risk
our safety, but I'm not.

462
00:47:01,488 --> 00:47:04,158
Why are you threatened
by anyone different from you?

463
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:11,456
Protect this family,
and stay away from them.

464
00:47:15,043 --> 00:47:17,254
Tarzan, for once
listen to Kerchak.

465
00:47:17,421 --> 00:47:21,133
Why didn't you tell me there were
creatures that looked like me?

466
00:47:29,016 --> 00:47:33,395
Well, he didn't stand upright,
he sort of crouched, like that.

467
00:47:33,478 --> 00:47:35,647
- Really?
- Supported his weight on his knuckles.

468
00:47:35,814 --> 00:47:37,441
- See?
- On the knuckles!

469
00:47:37,608 --> 00:47:40,319
- Exactly like a gorilla!
- Extraordinary!

470
00:47:40,611 --> 00:47:42,112
It was amazing!

471
00:47:42,196 --> 00:47:45,574
And he bends his elbows out like this,
and then he walks like this.

472
00:47:45,657 --> 00:47:48,285
Oh, I see!
Like Aunt Isabel!

473
00:47:50,579 --> 00:47:51,872
This is capital!

474
00:47:51,955 --> 00:47:54,458
Oh, Janey, Jane!
What a discovery!

475
00:47:54,625 --> 00:47:56,627
A man with no language,
no human behaviour.

476
00:47:56,793 --> 00:47:59,129
And no respect
for personal boundaries.

477
00:47:59,296 --> 00:48:02,883
- How do you mean?
- He was this close, Daddy! Staring at me.

478
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:06,220
He seemed confused
at first,

479
00:48:06,386 --> 00:48:09,515
as if he's never seen
another human before.

480
00:48:09,681 --> 00:48:11,975
His eyes were intense,

481
00:48:12,142 --> 00:48:14,853
and focused and...

482
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:19,149
I've never seen such eyes.

483
00:48:20,859 --> 00:48:21,902
Oh, shall I, ahem,

484
00:48:22,069 --> 00:48:25,823
leave you and the blackboard
alone for a moment?

485
00:48:25,989 --> 00:48:29,827
Daddy, stop it. The point is,
think of what we could learn from him.

486
00:48:29,993 --> 00:48:32,412
We must find him.

487
00:48:32,913 --> 00:48:36,542
Professor, you are here
to find gorillas,

488
00:48:36,625 --> 00:48:39,211
not indulge
some girlish fantasy.

489
00:48:39,336 --> 00:48:43,006
Fantasy? I didn't imagine him!
Tarzan is...

490
00:48:44,633 --> 00:48:45,634
Real.

491
00:48:45,884 --> 00:48:50,097
Ah! It's him!
It's, it's, it's him. Tarzan!

492
00:48:50,264 --> 00:48:52,099
- Professor! Jane! Stand back!
- Wait!

493
00:48:52,266 --> 00:48:54,184
No!

494
00:48:54,351 --> 00:48:56,186
Clayton.

495
00:48:58,355 --> 00:49:00,190
- Clayton.
- Ahh!

496
00:49:00,357 --> 00:49:02,568
Have we... met?

497
00:49:03,819 --> 00:49:05,571
How does he
know my name?

498
00:49:06,238 --> 00:49:08,282
He thinks it means
the sound of a gunshot.

499
00:49:08,448 --> 00:49:12,202
- Jane.
- Yes, hello, mmm, Tarzan.

500
00:49:12,369 --> 00:49:14,538
I see what you mean
about those personal boundaries.

501
00:49:14,705 --> 00:49:18,041
What's he doing?

502
00:49:18,208 --> 00:49:20,085
Look at him, Jane...

503
00:49:20,711 --> 00:49:22,546
Moves like an ape
but looks like a man.

504
00:49:22,629 --> 00:49:25,215
He could be
the missing link!

505
00:49:25,382 --> 00:49:28,552
Or our link
to the gorillas.

506
00:49:28,635 --> 00:49:30,888
Ahh, yes, yes.

507
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:34,141
Where are the gorillas?

508
00:49:35,851 --> 00:49:38,145
Go-ril-las!

509
00:49:38,312 --> 00:49:40,355
Go-ril-las!

510
00:49:40,522 --> 00:49:43,275
Shouting won't help, Mr Clayton.
He doesn't understand English.

511
00:49:43,442 --> 00:49:45,444
Then I'll make him understand.

512
00:49:45,611 --> 00:49:48,864
If I can teach a parrot
to sing "God Save the Queen,"

513
00:49:49,198 --> 00:49:52,534
I can certainly teach this savage
a thing or two.

514
00:49:53,619 --> 00:49:55,454
Go-rilla.

515
00:49:56,705 --> 00:49:59,708
- Go-rilla.
- Oh-ho! He's got it!

516
00:49:59,875 --> 00:50:02,961
Gorilla.
Gorilla!

517
00:50:03,128 --> 00:50:05,214
- Perhaps not.
- No, no, no, no!

518
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:08,217
- No, no, no, no, no!
- No, no, no. Gimme that.

519
00:50:08,383 --> 00:50:09,801
No, no.
Leave that. No.

520
00:50:09,968 --> 00:50:13,222
Mr Clayton,
I think I'll take it from here.

521
00:50:22,898 --> 00:50:24,983
<i>Whatever you do</i>

522
00:50:25,567 --> 00:50:26,902
<i>I'll do it too</i>

523
00:50:27,361 --> 00:50:30,322
<i>Show me everything
Tell me how</i>

524
00:50:30,948 --> 00:50:32,616
<i>It all means something</i>

525
00:50:33,408 --> 00:50:35,661
<i>And yet nothing to me</i>

526
00:50:38,956 --> 00:50:42,501
<i>I can see
there's so much to learn</i>

527
00:50:42,668 --> 00:50:46,296
<i>It's all so close
and yet so far</i>

528
00:50:46,964 --> 00:50:50,551
<i>I see myself
as people see me</i>

529
00:50:50,926 --> 00:50:54,805
<i>Oh, I just know there's
something bigger out there</i>

530
00:50:54,972 --> 00:50:58,809
<i>I wanna know
Can you show me</i>

531
00:50:58,976 --> 00:51:02,813
<i>I wanna know about
these strangers like me</i>

532
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:06,775
<i>Tell me more
Please show me</i>

533
00:51:06,942 --> 00:51:10,863
<i>Something's familiar about
these strangers like me</i>

534
00:51:19,163 --> 00:51:21,540
<i>Every gesture</i>

535
00:51:21,707 --> 00:51:26,879
<i>Every move that she makes
makes me feel like never before</i>

536
00:51:27,045 --> 00:51:29,214
<i>Why do I have</i>

537
00:51:29,381 --> 00:51:33,343
<i>This growing need
to be beside her</i>

538
00:51:35,012 --> 00:51:38,599
<i>Ooo, these emotions
I never knew</i>

539
00:51:38,765 --> 00:51:42,853
<i>Of some other world
far beyond this place</i>

540
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:46,648
<i>Beyond the trees
above the clouds</i>

541
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:50,903
<i>I see before me
a new horizon</i>

542
00:51:51,069 --> 00:51:55,032
<i>I wanna know
Can you show me</i>

543
00:51:55,199 --> 00:51:58,994
<i>I wanna know about
these strangers like me</i>

544
00:51:59,161 --> 00:52:02,956
<i>Tell me more
Please show me</i>

545
00:52:03,165 --> 00:52:06,877
<i>Something's familiar about
these strangers like me</i>

546
00:52:08,295 --> 00:52:12,132
<i>Come with me now
to see my world</i>

547
00:52:12,299 --> 00:52:16,303
<i>Where there's beauty
beyond your dreams</i>

548
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:20,390
<i>Can you feel the things
I feel</i>

549
00:52:20,557 --> 00:52:24,228
<i>Right now with you</i>

550
00:52:26,146 --> 00:52:28,649
<i>Take my hand</i>

551
00:52:28,816 --> 00:52:32,402
<i>There's a world
I need to know</i>

552
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:52,798
We've wasted
all this time on what he wants.

553
00:52:52,923 --> 00:52:56,927
The boat could arrive any day.
Now ask him straight out.

554
00:52:59,847 --> 00:53:00,889
Tarzan?

555
00:53:01,932 --> 00:53:04,309
Will you take us
to the gorillas?

556
00:53:04,601 --> 00:53:06,228
Do you understand?

557
00:53:06,353 --> 00:53:08,188
I understand.

558
00:53:08,355 --> 00:53:10,232
- Ooh! Good work, Jane.
- Well?

559
00:53:10,941 --> 00:53:12,109
I can't.

560
00:53:12,276 --> 00:53:14,027
- What?
- Why not, Tarzan?

561
00:53:14,862 --> 00:53:16,113
Kerchak.

562
00:53:19,241 --> 00:53:23,203
<i>I wanna know
Can you show me</i>

563
00:53:23,370 --> 00:53:27,082
<i>I wanna know about
these strangers like me</i>

564
00:53:27,249 --> 00:53:31,587
<i>Tell me more
Please show me</i>

565
00:53:31,753 --> 00:53:36,091
<i>Something's familiar about
these strangers like me</i>

566
00:53:36,258 --> 00:53:38,260
<i>I wanna know</i>

567
00:53:55,777 --> 00:53:59,990
Oh, Terk, I've never
seen him so happy.

568
00:54:00,157 --> 00:54:01,909
Eh, I give it a week.

569
00:54:05,078 --> 00:54:07,331
Aye, cut her loose!

570
00:54:07,623 --> 00:54:11,168
- Arg, c'mon.
- Allright, move it, you fieldrats.

571
00:54:13,337 --> 00:54:14,630
Put your back into it.

572
00:54:14,796 --> 00:54:17,466
Wait, please. Don't...
I've waited 30 years for this,

573
00:54:17,633 --> 00:54:19,801
and I won't leave
until I see a gorilla.

574
00:54:19,968 --> 00:54:21,929
Oh, isn't this dreadful,
Tarzan?

575
00:54:22,095 --> 00:54:24,306
Whoa!
No, no. Wait.

576
00:54:28,936 --> 00:54:29,978
You're the captain.

577
00:54:30,062 --> 00:54:33,774
Just tell them you've had engine
trouble, and give us two more days.

578
00:54:33,941 --> 00:54:36,318
And be late at every port
from here to London?

579
00:54:36,485 --> 00:54:38,320
We'll have come all this way
for nothing.

580
00:54:38,487 --> 00:54:42,407
I'm sorry, Miss Porter,
but I simply can't do it.

581
00:54:42,574 --> 00:54:44,618
Agh! This is your fault.

582
00:54:44,785 --> 00:54:47,913
I should've followed my instincts,
and set traps for the beasts.

583
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:50,541
Don't you think I'm disappointed
about the gorillas?

584
00:54:50,707 --> 00:54:53,585
- You are absolutely impos...
- Oh!

585
00:54:53,752 --> 00:54:57,256
Tarzan! I was so afraid
you wouldn't come in time.

586
00:54:57,422 --> 00:54:59,800
The boat's arrived.
The boat that's come...

587
00:54:59,967 --> 00:55:02,177
to take us home
to England.

588
00:55:02,344 --> 00:55:06,390
And Daddy and I were wond...
Well, I was wondering...

589
00:55:06,557 --> 00:55:10,853
Well, we really hope that you'll
come with us. Won't you?

590
00:55:12,396 --> 00:55:15,149
Go see England today,
come home tomorrow.

591
00:55:15,315 --> 00:55:17,442
Oh, no.

592
00:55:17,609 --> 00:55:21,822
Well, you see, it would be
very difficult to come back... ever.

593
00:55:21,989 --> 00:55:23,448
Not come back?

594
00:55:23,615 --> 00:55:26,618
Oh, no, no. I know it sounds awful,
but you belong with us.

595
00:55:26,785 --> 00:55:29,538
- With people.
- Jane must stay with Tarzan.

596
00:55:29,705 --> 00:55:32,624
Wh... Stay here?
Oh, no, no. My laundry!

597
00:55:32,791 --> 00:55:36,753
No, I can't stay.
Look, I've got...

598
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:39,214
I've got my father
and...

599
00:55:39,381 --> 00:55:42,843
Jane, stay.

600
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:45,679
- But...
- Please.

601
00:55:47,931 --> 00:55:50,601
But... I can't.

602
00:55:52,811 --> 00:55:54,396
Women!

603
00:55:54,563 --> 00:55:57,316
How typical!
Thank you, Jones.

604
00:55:57,483 --> 00:56:01,612
Even if you hadn't grown up a savage,
you'd be lost.

605
00:56:01,778 --> 00:56:05,115
There are no trails
through a woman's heart.

606
00:56:05,574 --> 00:56:07,034
Jane is going.

607
00:56:07,659 --> 00:56:12,998
Yes. If only she could've spent
more time with the gorillas.

608
00:56:13,165 --> 00:56:15,334
She's so disappointed.

609
00:56:15,501 --> 00:56:18,170
Crushed, really.

610
00:56:18,921 --> 00:56:20,714
Sorry, old boy.

611
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:24,843
Oh, well. I'd best
get Jane's things to the ship.

612
00:56:28,847 --> 00:56:31,767
Clayton!

613
00:56:31,934 --> 00:56:34,186
If Jane sees gorillas,

614
00:56:34,353 --> 00:56:36,188
she stays?

615
00:56:36,355 --> 00:56:39,566
Say, that's why she came,
isn't it?

616
00:56:42,027 --> 00:56:42,778
I'll do it.

617
00:56:43,403 --> 00:56:46,281
- Good man! Snipes?
- Sir?

618
00:56:46,365 --> 00:56:50,702
Get the boys together.
There's gonna be a change in plans.

619
00:56:50,953 --> 00:56:53,080
Terk, all you have to do
is get Kerchak out of the way.

620
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:55,082
- What?
- I'd be happy to get Kerchak...

621
00:56:55,249 --> 00:56:58,460
Shut your trunk
and get me outta here.

622
00:56:59,419 --> 00:57:01,922
Can you believe that guy?

623
00:57:02,005 --> 00:57:04,675
Drops us like a newborn giraffe...
kerplop!

624
00:57:04,842 --> 00:57:07,886
Now waltzes in here
and expects us to just...

625
00:57:08,053 --> 00:57:10,848
Terk, I'm asking you
as a friend.

626
00:57:13,767 --> 00:57:16,103
With the face
and the eyes, and the...

627
00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:18,147
Aah! All right!

628
00:57:18,313 --> 00:57:20,732
But don't make me do
anything embarrassing.

629
00:57:21,567 --> 00:57:23,443
I'm gonna kill him!

630
00:57:23,861 --> 00:57:26,989
A- Actually, I thought that dress
was rather slimming on you.

631
00:57:27,156 --> 00:57:29,575
Oh, really? I thought it was
a little revealing and kind of...

632
00:57:33,078 --> 00:57:35,622
How does she move in this thing?

633
00:57:38,041 --> 00:57:39,877
Look out!

634
00:58:05,861 --> 00:58:09,364
- Oh, look, Daddy.
- Where? Wh... Wh...

635
00:58:09,531 --> 00:58:12,242
Jane!

636
00:58:12,409 --> 00:58:16,497
Be careful, Professor.

637
00:58:16,663 --> 00:58:19,708
She's beautiful.

638
00:58:19,875 --> 00:58:22,252
She's my mother.

639
00:58:22,419 --> 00:58:24,671
Th...
This is your...

640
00:58:27,132 --> 00:58:28,467
mother.

641
00:58:38,101 --> 00:58:39,770
Wh-What's happening?

642
00:58:39,937 --> 00:58:41,855
I don't know, Daddy.

643
00:58:42,022 --> 00:58:46,819
- Oh, it's getting away!
- No! You'll only frighten her more.

644
00:58:53,659 --> 00:58:57,371
Oh, yes. Absolutely, my dear.
Good idea.

645
00:58:57,538 --> 00:58:59,623
What are you doing?
Do you want to frighten them off?

646
00:58:59,790 --> 00:59:02,000
Get up!
Get...

647
00:59:02,167 --> 00:59:04,378
Don't get up.

648
00:59:35,826 --> 00:59:36,952
Hello.

649
00:59:41,832 --> 00:59:44,501
It's very nice
to meet you too.

650
00:59:46,503 --> 00:59:51,049
Oh, Your Majesty,
you're such a tease.

651
00:59:53,302 --> 00:59:56,638
Hello. Hello. Uh,
Archimedes Q. Porter at your service.

652
00:59:56,805 --> 00:59:58,765
Aah! Quite a grip you've got.

653
00:59:58,932 --> 01:00:01,518
Oh, thank you.

654
01:00:01,685 --> 01:00:04,354
Is that one of mine?

655
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,857
Oh, this is wonderful,
Mr Clayton!

656
01:00:07,024 --> 01:00:08,567
Look! Look!
Social grooming.

657
01:00:08,734 --> 01:00:11,820
Congratulations, Professor.

658
01:00:12,029 --> 01:00:15,324
Our dream has come true.

659
01:00:19,578 --> 01:00:21,413
Give me that! Hey, what're you doing?

660
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:24,500
Stop that! Stop!
Hold on, now! Leave that!

661
01:00:25,292 --> 01:00:27,127
That is not
to be played with!

662
01:00:41,850 --> 01:00:44,353
- Can you teach me?
- Speak gorilla?

663
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,396
Mmm, yes.

664
01:01:08,710 --> 01:01:11,255
Good heavens!
What did I say?

665
01:01:12,422 --> 01:01:14,633
That Jane stays
with Tarzan.

666
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:17,803
Stay?
But I thought we'd already...

667
01:01:18,387 --> 01:01:20,722
But, Tarzan, I, I...

668
01:01:20,889 --> 01:01:23,392
Whoa! Look out!

669
01:01:25,811 --> 01:01:28,814
- Is that my dress?
- Oh, no.

670
01:01:32,776 --> 01:01:35,487
Oh, Daddy.

671
01:01:35,654 --> 01:01:39,074
Give it to me!

672
01:01:42,327 --> 01:01:44,246
No!

673
01:02:02,347 --> 01:02:03,307
Go!

674
01:02:04,641 --> 01:02:07,644
- Wait! Wait! Tarzan!
- Go now!

675
01:02:07,811 --> 01:02:10,856
Jane, quickly!
Hurry! Come along.

676
01:02:30,792 --> 01:02:32,711
Kerchak, I didn't...

677
01:02:33,212 --> 01:02:37,132
- I'm sorry, I...
- I asked you to protect our family,

678
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:41,136
and you betrayed us all.

679
01:03:09,498 --> 01:03:12,334
I'm so confused.

680
01:03:14,378 --> 01:03:15,754
Come with me.

681
01:03:16,129 --> 01:03:19,508
There's something I should've
shown you long ago.

682
01:04:39,171 --> 01:04:40,589
Is this me?

683
01:04:44,885 --> 01:04:48,722
And this is my father,
and,

684
01:04:48,889 --> 01:04:51,099
and my...

685
01:04:52,059 --> 01:04:53,685
Now you know.

686
01:04:54,394 --> 01:04:58,565
Tarzan, I just want you
to be happy,

687
01:04:58,732 --> 01:05:00,859
whatever you decide.

688
01:05:48,991 --> 01:05:53,245
No matter where I go,
you will always be my mother.

689
01:05:57,457 --> 01:06:01,420
And you will always
be in my heart.

690
01:06:20,647 --> 01:06:22,816
Oh, goodbye, Tarzan.

691
01:06:22,983 --> 01:06:26,320
Tarzan!
I'm so glad you found us in time.

692
01:06:37,122 --> 01:06:38,415
Tarzan!

693
01:06:38,499 --> 01:06:42,044
We're too late!
I can't believe it!

694
01:06:42,169 --> 01:06:44,046
If you'd have pulled over
and asked for directions...

695
01:06:44,171 --> 01:06:46,423
We didn't get
to say goodbye.

696
01:06:46,548 --> 01:06:49,843
Yeah, well, good riddance!
All right? Who needs ya? Huh?

697
01:06:49,968 --> 01:06:54,598
Go on, get out of here, bald boy!
You ingrate! You bald ingrate!

698
01:06:54,723 --> 01:06:56,642
Go on and rot,
for all I care!

699
01:06:56,809 --> 01:06:58,685
Go!

700
01:07:00,896 --> 01:07:04,399
- What are you lookin' at?
- I'm gonna miss him too.

701
01:07:12,866 --> 01:07:15,410
Tarzan, you can't imagine
what's in store for you.

702
01:07:15,577 --> 01:07:18,705
You're going to see the world.
Everyone's going to want to meet you.

703
01:07:18,831 --> 01:07:20,707
Kings, scientists
and famous writers.

704
01:07:20,874 --> 01:07:24,294
Yes, Darwin and Kipling.
Queen Victoria.

705
01:07:24,461 --> 01:07:26,588
I haven't met her,
but I heard she's awfully nice.

706
01:07:26,755 --> 01:07:30,634
And I'll be with Jane?

707
01:07:30,801 --> 01:07:34,388
Yes, with Jane.

708
01:07:34,555 --> 01:07:36,932
Ooh! Slippery.

709
01:07:57,244 --> 01:07:58,328
Tarzan!

710
01:08:00,038 --> 01:08:00,956
Tarzan!

711
01:08:01,123 --> 01:08:03,625
Get him!

712
01:08:03,792 --> 01:08:06,962
Get him!

713
01:08:07,129 --> 01:08:09,631
- Tarzan!
- Jane!

714
01:08:31,361 --> 01:08:35,157
- What's going on here?
- Clayton. Clayton, help.

715
01:08:37,326 --> 01:08:38,952
Have we met?

716
01:08:42,122 --> 01:08:43,999
Ah, yes.

717
01:08:44,124 --> 01:08:46,001
The ape man.

718
01:08:46,835 --> 01:08:50,339
Clayton, you...
You...

719
01:08:52,049 --> 01:08:54,718
So sorry about
the rude welcome, old boy.

720
01:08:54,801 --> 01:08:57,137
But I couldn't have you
making a scene...

721
01:08:57,262 --> 01:09:00,641
when we put your furry friends
in their cages.

722
01:09:01,558 --> 01:09:03,977
- Why?
- Why?

723
01:09:04,394 --> 01:09:06,939
For 300 pounds sterling
a head.

724
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:10,818
Actually, I have you
to thank, my boy.

725
01:09:11,235 --> 01:09:13,612
Couldn't have done it
without you.

726
01:09:16,073 --> 01:09:17,950
Lock him up
with the others.

727
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:24,414
Uh, that sounded
like Tarzan.

728
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:26,792
He sounded like,
like he was in trouble.

729
01:09:26,917 --> 01:09:31,255
Yeah, well, why doesn't he get his new
friends to help him? I don't care.

730
01:09:31,839 --> 01:09:33,590
That's it!

731
01:09:33,924 --> 01:09:36,969
I've had it with you
and your emotional constipation!

732
01:09:37,094 --> 01:09:40,097
Tarzan needs us,
and we're gonna help him!

733
01:09:40,222 --> 01:09:44,059
You got that?
Now, pipe down and hang on tight.

734
01:09:44,226 --> 01:09:46,311
We've got a boat to catch.

735
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:58,740
I've never felt so alive!

736
01:09:58,824 --> 01:10:01,326
Good!
'Cause I'm gonna kill ya!

737
01:10:01,743 --> 01:10:03,662
No time for that now,
missy.

738
01:10:24,558 --> 01:10:26,894
Tarzan, it's no use.
Don't!

739
01:10:34,943 --> 01:10:37,571
- Clayton.
- Yes, Clayton.

740
01:10:37,738 --> 01:10:39,823
Clayton betrayed us all.

741
01:10:40,157 --> 01:10:43,076
- I'm so sorry, Tarzan.
- No.

742
01:10:43,243 --> 01:10:47,080
I did this.
I betrayed my family.

743
01:10:47,247 --> 01:10:49,082
Kerchak was right.

744
01:10:49,583 --> 01:10:54,254
Oh, those magnificent creatures,
shivering in cages!

745
01:10:54,421 --> 01:10:56,924
What is this world
coming to?

746
01:11:02,888 --> 01:11:05,432
Oh, by Jove,
don't know my own strength.

747
01:11:10,562 --> 01:11:11,980
What was that?

748
01:11:12,773 --> 01:11:14,858
You are an animal!

749
01:11:16,944 --> 01:11:18,445
That sounded just like an elephant.

750
01:11:18,821 --> 01:11:19,905
Tantor!

751
01:11:22,115 --> 01:11:23,075
Thanks, guys.

752
01:11:23,283 --> 01:11:27,079
I thought I would never see you again,
and here you are!

753
01:11:28,205 --> 01:11:31,166
Sometimes you embarrass me.

754
01:12:38,859 --> 01:12:41,570
Ah, I remember you.

755
01:12:43,363 --> 01:12:46,366
I think this one
will be better off stuffed.

756
01:13:00,672 --> 01:13:02,799
Charge!

757
01:13:08,597 --> 01:13:11,558
- You came back.
- I came home.

758
01:13:26,532 --> 01:13:27,574
Fire!

759
01:13:34,373 --> 01:13:38,293
You there! Take what you can
back to the boat!

760
01:13:40,629 --> 01:13:42,714
I've got some hunting
to do.

761
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:44,800
Hey!

762
01:14:07,614 --> 01:14:08,407
Don't worry.

763
01:14:08,490 --> 01:14:10,742
I'm going to have you
out of this in a second.

764
01:14:15,372 --> 01:14:18,750
Right.
This should do the trick.

765
01:14:40,772 --> 01:14:42,483
Hiding, are we?

766
01:14:42,608 --> 01:14:44,943
- Go on!
- Clayton, you...

767
01:14:45,068 --> 01:14:48,614
I could use a challenge
because after I get rid of you,

768
01:14:48,739 --> 01:14:53,535
rounding up your little ape family
will be all too easy!

769
01:15:20,562 --> 01:15:22,731
Go ahead, shoot me.

770
01:15:26,109 --> 01:15:29,071
Be a man.

771
01:15:35,577 --> 01:15:37,162
Not a man like you!

772
01:16:07,401 --> 01:16:08,902
Clayton!

773
01:16:10,696 --> 01:16:13,240
Clayton, don't!

774
01:17:04,249 --> 01:17:06,126
Tarzan.

775
01:17:06,251 --> 01:17:09,463
Kerchak... forgive me.

776
01:17:11,048 --> 01:17:16,178
No. Forgive me
for not understanding...

777
01:17:16,303 --> 01:17:20,098
that you have always been
one of us.

778
01:17:21,975 --> 01:17:24,978
Our family
will look to you now.

779
01:17:27,439 --> 01:17:29,358
No, Kerchak.

780
01:17:29,441 --> 01:17:30,651
Take care of them,

781
01:17:33,278 --> 01:17:34,822
my son.

782
01:17:43,247 --> 01:17:46,458
Take care of them.

783
01:19:06,497 --> 01:19:10,584
London will seem so small
compared to all this.

784
01:19:10,709 --> 01:19:13,462
I will miss you, Jane.

785
01:19:13,587 --> 01:19:17,132
- Miss Porter!
- I, I know. I'm coming.

786
01:19:18,634 --> 01:19:22,805
Well, I suppose
we should say goodbye.

787
01:19:34,858 --> 01:19:35,901
Goodbye.

788
01:19:45,410 --> 01:19:49,206
Goodbye, Tarzan!
Goodbye.

789
01:19:49,331 --> 01:19:52,125
Oh, I'm going to miss
that boy.

790
01:20:01,135 --> 01:20:05,430
Jane, dear, I can't help feeling
that you should stay.

791
01:20:05,556 --> 01:20:10,310
Daddy, please don't. We've been through
all of this. I couldn't possibly st...

792
01:20:10,435 --> 01:20:14,773
I, I belong in England with you,
with people, and... Aah!

793
01:20:20,779 --> 01:20:22,573
But you love him.

794
01:20:27,744 --> 01:20:28,954
Go on.

795
01:20:54,855 --> 01:20:58,817
Thank you.
Thanks for getting my glove.

796
01:20:58,984 --> 01:21:00,819
Thank you.

797
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:12,581
Well...

798
01:21:16,210 --> 01:21:20,380
But, what...
What am I doing? Captain?

799
01:21:20,547 --> 01:21:22,633
Tell them that
you never found us. Eh?

800
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:26,261
After all, people get lost
in the jungle every day. Right?

801
01:21:26,637 --> 01:21:27,387
Tootle-pip!

802
01:21:47,866 --> 01:21:51,787
<i>Put your faith
in what you most believe in</i>

803
01:21:51,954 --> 01:21:55,707
<i>Two worlds
One family</i>

804
01:21:55,874 --> 01:21:59,711
<i>Trust your heart
Let fate decide</i>

805
01:21:59,878 --> 01:22:04,591
<i>To guide these lives
To guide these lives we see</i>

806
01:22:04,758 --> 01:22:08,720
