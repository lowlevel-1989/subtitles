1
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:02,318
I have a secret

2
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:03,954
What is it?

3
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:08,596
I'm just so attractive!

4
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:17,007
Why can't Koreans acknowledge
other people's merits?

5
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:20,376
That's why there are no heroes here.

6
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:25,243
I've dated a lot, you know.

7
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:27,718
But it's all a waste of time.

8
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:32,749
Another man just fell
head-over-heels for me!

9
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:38,528
They say princesses are lonely
and they're right.

10
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:44,368
I just blame it all on my charm.

11
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:54,574
I'm really not lonely.

12
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:58,748
I'm not lonely at all!

13
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:01,412
Please Teach Me English

14
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,753
My name is Young-Ju Na
and I'm 25 years old.

15
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:10,555
I'm an entry-level public official.

16
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:19,396
Didn't I tell you not to call me
at the office?

17
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:22,839
How many times do I have to...

18
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:27,503
Those born in '79 may get into a fight,

19
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,515
Stay away from gatherings. A fight?

20
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,210
Excuse me?

21
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:34,911
May I help you?

22
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:40,451
Hi. Um. They billed me over a hundred
thousand won for my electricity.

23
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:42,961
Um. How in the world is that possible?

24
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:46,226
I'm a single resident.
I don't have a rice cooker.

25
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:48,267
I don't have a television set.

26
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:52,668
Um. I think this must be a mistake.
Can you help me with that?

27
00:02:54,007 --> 00:03:00,879
Hey! Miss! Hey! Look at me!

28
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:05,384
Say something for Christ's sake!

29
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:07,612
Doesn't anyone here speak English?

30
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:13,286
Miss! Where are you going?

31
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,520
You know if you've been there.

32
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:20,122
There's only one thing you can do.

33
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,668
Just smile.

34
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:27,530
Why are you laughing at me?
Do I look funny to you?

35
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,579
Time over.

36
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:39,983
Time what?

37
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:43,679
Over.

38
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:48,750
We held the 88 Olympics 15 years ago,

39
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:54,794
and made the 2002 World Cup semi-finals.

40
00:03:55,702 --> 00:04:00,730
Now the 45,000 public officials of Seoul

41
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:05,141
lead the way on the road to the world!

42
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:09,213
- Not having anyone in our office who
- It can't be me.

43
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:12,445
Speaks English is embarrassing.

44
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:16,147
I have never, ever been picked for
anything at school.

45
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:20,716
Never won even the cheapest lottery ticket.
I'm just plain unlucky.

46
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:24,160
Lady Luck just despises me.

47
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:30,696
Let's hear it for Miss Young-Ju Na.

48
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:35,002
I'm sure she'll do us proud.

49
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:45,182
Can we get a new grill here!
Pass the bottle.

50
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:54,855
Making me study English because of just
one foreigner is ridiculous.

51
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,721
What is she saying?

52
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,695
You want more pork?

53
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:06,103
Oh, you want to sing? Sing a pop song!

54
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:07,639
Pop song! Pop song!

55
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:10,267
I don't want to
go to a language school.

56
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:30,253
Everyone's obsessed with English.

57
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:35,461
What's wrong with being born in Korea
and just knowing Korean?

58
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:00,953
What brought you here?
"[Spin the bottle]"

59
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:04,554
Did you see him? He's so cool.

60
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,928
I thought I was going to die.

61
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,733
At the institute.

62
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:11,269
I'm signing up.

63
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:16,707
A native speaker's class, of course.
I've been coming here long enough.

64
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:20,378
Thank you. Bye.
Bye.

65
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:50,240
Excuse me, lady.

66
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:52,106
Mister, I haven't got time for games.

67
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:58,105
Move it.

68
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:19,269
You are beautiful!

69
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:26,075
- Thank you
- Bye.

70
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:27,340
Look here.

71
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:37,050
We never met. And I don't have time.
I've made up my mind to study.

72
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,283
I'll be going.

73
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:41,225
But look.

74
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:44,690
My glasses are broken.

75
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:46,993
So they are.

76
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,296
You should be careful.

77
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,997
You need to take a level test.

78
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:57,506
Why?

79
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,185
Come on! Come on!

80
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,814
You can't speak a single word of English, can you?

81
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:17,124
My reading comprehension's okay.

82
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:19,824
Could you write it down?

83
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:39,445
Honey! What was your score on the
college entrance exam?

84
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,822
Oh, baby! Welcome to Korea!

85
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,392
Did you take the TOEFL or TOEIC test?

86
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:52,493
You great sexy girl!

87
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:53,862
Are you crazy?

88
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:55,264
No. I'm Park Moon-Su.

89
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:03,200
Oh my God!

90
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:21,856
I only stopped by, you see.

91
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:25,193
Can't I come back next time?

92
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:32,596
Can you speak English?

93
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:38,075
Hey! You're so cute.

94
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:42,071
Fancy meeting you here.

95
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:47,882
Is this all you?

96
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:53,758
Wow, that's so cool.

97
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:58,095
Evaluation Impossible

98
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,760
Not my type.

99
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:09,967
I'm concentrating on studying.

100
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:17,606
Looks like I'll be doing a lot of
studying, and nothing else.

101
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:24,546
The women here make me want to cry.

102
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:47,939
Is this level A?

103
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:56,419
Sorry about your glasses.

104
00:10:58,357 --> 00:10:59,483
What?

105
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:00,881
I'm sorry.

106
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:30,415
Hello, everyone.

107
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:31,683
Nice to meet you.

108
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:36,085
Catherine Presley. This is my name.
Please call me Cathy.

109
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:40,725
I think we're going to have a really
good time together over the next few months.

110
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,826
As long as you guys study hard.

111
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:49,967
You kids do your best and I'll do my best.

112
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,031
Kids?

113
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,975
Isn't my Korean good?

114
00:11:56,515 --> 00:12:00,178
Why? You're shocked?

115
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:10,792
Please tell me why you
want to learn English.

116
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:13,627
And after that choose
an English nickname.

117
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:16,761
Because everyone does it. Right?

118
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:18,064
English is a necessity.

119
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:21,335
Actually, this is my nineteenth institute.

120
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,238
More like the twentieth.

121
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:25,436
I don't see anything special yet.

122
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:27,274
And my nickname is Betty.

123
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:29,576
What's with you? Not again.

124
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:35,052
My new boss is a foreigner
so meetings are in English.

125
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:40,852
Frankly, I don't understand much.

126
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:47,825
We old-timers know words and grammar,

127
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,460
but can't carry on a conversation.

128
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:52,561
Mr. Lee! Mr. Lee! Can you come
and join us, please?

129
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:07,110
Would Richard be okay?

130
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:09,916
Richard. A king's name.

131
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,155
And next...

132
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,827
Would you pick one for me?

133
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:23,198
It's your nickname. Why should
I think of one for you?

134
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:34,207
Because... you are my beautiful teacher!

135
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:43,712
Okay. Um... Elvis!
Your sideburns remind me of the superstar.

136
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:45,188
Okay?

137
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:46,315
Elvis?

138
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,018
Good! Thank you very much!

139
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:51,460
You're very welcome.

140
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,095
And...

141
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,768
I'll just use my real name.

142
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:04,472
Everyone must have an English
nickname in this class.

143
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,570
Just pick any name!

144
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:15,018
My parents gave me my name.
I'll just be 'Young-Ju'.

145
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:18,821
No.

146
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:20,756
Why are you being difficult?

147
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,626
[You're not some kind of nationalist!]
[Nationalist.]

148
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,687
Choosing your English nickname
is a part of studying.

149
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:28,399
Think of an English name!

150
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:36,041
Now, you introduce your partner
to the class in English.

151
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:38,406
The person next to you
is your partner.

152
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:45,014
His nickname is Elvis.

153
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:48,613
And...

154
00:14:53,259 --> 00:15:01,860
he is salesman...
he is salesman...

155
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:03,629
and

156
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:11,566
handsome man.

157
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:14,644
And...

158
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:17,715
The end.

159
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,646
The end.

160
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:24,518
And next is the superstar.

161
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:31,786
What's your name again?

162
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,627
Na Young-Ju.

163
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:38,792
Na Young-Ju. Doesn't want a nickname.

164
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:52,479
- How do you say "plain" in English?
- Normal!

165
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,415
- Nor... ru-mal, Nor... ru-mal. Thank you.
- She is Normal.

166
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:59,355
Not nor... ru-mal... Normal.

167
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:01,825
She is normal.

168
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:05,423
She is normal!

169
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:08,799
She is normal.

170
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:13,170
She is normal.

171
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:14,436
Correct.

172
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:15,871
Very good!

173
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:32,482
A sweep! 3 cards!
[Was it two go? Three go!]

174
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:36,392
Yes! I'm selling!

175
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:40,832
Gambling brings out your true nature.

176
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:42,560
Always.

177
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:45,393
Really? Then what am I like?

178
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:47,598
You're nice.

179
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:48,605
What do you mean?

180
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:52,134
Nice is good for a woman.

181
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:53,542
Cut the cards!

182
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:56,346
Women who stand out have difficult lives.

183
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:59,276
There's nothing special about me?

184
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:03,350
This is the ninth game.
How many times did you sit out?

185
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:07,053
Seven times?

186
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:12,861
See! Your life is meant to be plain.

187
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:14,963
Plain?

188
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,198
Yeah, plain.

189
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:18,362
PLAIN!

190
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:23,105
How could you say that to your daughter?

191
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:25,441
Bah!

192
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,054
Cathy.

193
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,387
It's Cathy.

194
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:43,185
Cathy.

195
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:47,963
Cathy! One question.

196
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:51,733
What is your question, Elvis?

197
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,863
What is your handphone number?

198
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,410
Not handphone.

199
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:04,643
My mobile phone number is private.

200
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:06,913
Okay. My joke.

201
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:12,252
How do you describe a beautiful
and sexy lady?

202
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:13,188
Gorgeous.

203
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,657
Gorgeous?

204
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:18,662
Yeah. Everyone,
Repeat. Gorgeous.

205
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,322
Gorgeous.

206
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:25,032
Gorgeous equal Cathy.

207
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:28,000
Really!

208
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:36,346
Hello!

209
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:42,349
I picked a nickname, but you didn't ask.

210
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:45,145
It's Candy!

211
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,919
Candy!? That's it for today, everyone.
See you next time.

212
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:54,022
Bye.
Bye, Cathy.

213
00:18:56,702 --> 00:19:03,005
I should have called myself "Normal".

214
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:09,775
Wait for me!

215
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:50,746
Size 5. Candy, you have
such cute, little feet.

216
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:15,039
Thank the gods! I have found
the owner of this shoe!

217
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:20,816
I'm an entry-level public official.

218
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,036
Aren't you getting in?

219
00:20:51,483 --> 00:21:00,790
This is the man I've
been waiting for!

220
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:08,827
What number are you taking?

221
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:13,528
Number 111.

222
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,681
Me, too...

223
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:27,515
I see...

224
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:43,594
[I don't like subway trains.]

225
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:47,070
They say the subway is a
lunch box for cannibals.

226
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:02,351
Yeah...
es, I'm an idiot.

227
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:12,087
Hey? It's here. It's here.

228
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:29,373
I'm sorry.

229
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:33,378
What a ditz!

230
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:42,183
Stamp my heart with a seal of love!

231
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:56,940
Sorry to all the studs in Korea.

232
00:22:57,843 --> 00:23:00,744
I'm already taken.

233
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:13,956
Wow, 2 minutes and 35 seconds!

234
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:15,856
I tied Dad's record.

235
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:21,629
We have a saying.

236
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:26,493
You can read a person's life in their feet.

237
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:34,239
Obviously you are graceful and classy.

238
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:38,442
And will continue to forever...

239
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:43,781
You are just too much.

240
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:47,254
Did you know...

241
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:52,126
you have such small, exquisite
feet for someone of your stature.

242
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:55,057
Really.

243
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,561
Yes, yes. Wrap these up.

244
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:00,937
Bye-bye, cutie pie!

245
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:06,469
Please, come again.

246
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:19,656
Miss Lee. I'll ask something
in English and you answer!

247
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:21,248
I'm busy.

248
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,194
It's easy. Translate this.

249
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:26,059
I love you long!

250
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,165
You think I'm stupid?

251
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:34,463
I've loved you for a long time.

252
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:36,598
Me too, Miss Lee.

253
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:37,505
Right?

254
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:43,674
No. The answer is
"I will love you for a long time."

255
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:07,366
Welcome to our store.

256
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:10,674
Try on anything you like.

257
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:13,710
Do you have these in size 5?

258
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:15,978
These are size 5.

259
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:19,107
I think these would look good on you.

260
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:21,945
Aren't they... too plain?

261
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:26,616
Plain is good, you know.

262
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:30,092
Take a seat and try them on.

263
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:33,153
And throw these away.

264
00:25:34,132 --> 00:25:38,296
You should just sell the plain ones,
or else not have those on display.

265
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,894
Here you go.

266
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:42,600
I have a lot of plain ones at home.

267
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:49,036
Hi, Yunjin. I've been so busy, baby.

268
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:50,843
So many overseas business trips.

269
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:57,253
I don't even have time to
go to the bathroom.

270
00:25:57,322 --> 00:25:59,051
I'll call you back later.

271
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:03,788
What is it! Wait, wait, wait.

272
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:06,696
Wait.

273
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:10,591
You good-for-nothing bum!

274
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:15,163
You're eyeballing
a married woman now!

275
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,140
What married woman?

276
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:21,468
Ms. Lee in the ladies' bags section!

277
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:23,776
Her second child is already crawling!

278
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:25,445
Second?

279
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:29,612
The nerve of that woman,
pretending to be available.

280
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:30,780
What a witch.

281
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:35,120
You're a disgrace to me,
just like your lousy father!

282
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,421
What? Mom!

283
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:42,795
If you ever say I'm like him again,
I'll move out!

284
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:50,072
Pronunciation is very important

285
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:51,472
Listen, look,

286
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:52,271
Repeat.

287
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:55,211
Russia!

288
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,611
Russia!

289
00:26:56,681 --> 00:26:59,377
Good! Next word.

290
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,180
Italy

291
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:02,879
Italy

292
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:03,943
Excellent!

293
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:06,513
Now, get your bodies into this one.

294
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:08,889
Brazil

295
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,451
Brazil

296
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:16,031
Candy, why aren't you doing it?

297
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:18,530
Try it by yourself!

298
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:24,637
Brazil

299
00:27:28,613 --> 00:27:30,171
Zoo

300
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:32,944
Zoo

301
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,520
Shape your lips like a doughnut.

302
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:39,648
Zoo

303
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:43,623
Zoo

304
00:27:44,462 --> 00:27:47,625
Zoo

305
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:50,366
Zoo

306
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,906
Sorry!

307
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:07,884
Cathy, how long do we have to do this?

308
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:09,610
What did you say?

309
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:16,688
I'm leaving for the U.S. Any day.
When do we get to speak?

310
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:20,589
I can study pronunciation with a tape.
I don't need to pay for that.

311
00:28:20,665 --> 00:28:21,996
Don't you agree?

312
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:22,931
Hey, Jolie!

313
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:26,801
I've been to almost 20 institutes.

314
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:29,101
But this is the slowest class.

315
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:32,269
Koreans are always rushing everything.

316
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:35,579
Do You want to learn how
to speak English well?

317
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:37,944
Then do as I say!

318
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:42,411
I came here to learn quickly.

319
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:44,955
I don't have money to burn, you know?

320
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:47,792
And she talks condescendingly in Korean.

321
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:50,787
It's because her Korean's not that good.

322
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:52,329
My Korean is fine.

323
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,597
That's it for tonight! See you next time!

324
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,433
Ashtray.
Ashtray.

325
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,171
Unification.
Unification.

326
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:09,406
Side dish.
Side dish.

327
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,607
This is a tough one.

328
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,681
Adoption.
Adoption?

329
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,416
He doesn't know.

330
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:20,418
Adoption.

331
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:25,395
Wow! That's amazing.
How do you memorize all that?

332
00:29:25,463 --> 00:29:28,125
I just memorized some vocabulary.

333
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:31,999
What good is vocabulary when
you can't even open your mouth.

334
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:34,299
Don't you have to go home
and cook something?

335
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,801
Why don't you go cook!

336
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:43,671
English is all about words. This guy
in my hometown ate two dictionaries.

337
00:29:43,748 --> 00:29:46,012
Now he's at Seoul National University.

338
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:49,012
That was in the old days.

339
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:55,026
I hear yelling in English is the
hottest thing nowadays.

340
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:58,824
They say you start talking fluently
after only 30 days!

341
00:29:58,897 --> 00:30:02,025
Where do they teach that?
That's where I need to go.

342
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,965
That's no good. It's too embarrassing.

343
00:30:04,035 --> 00:30:08,301
Elvis... I have a question.

344
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:12,571
What's your cell phone number?

345
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:26,420
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

346
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:29,551
It's the alcohol, that's what it is...

347
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:35,291
I think I'm drunk.

348
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,297
Your shoes are too small.

349
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:41,172
I'm a size 5! You want to see?

350
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:46,406
Ladies first. Sit down.

351
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:48,572
No, no.

352
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:51,678
Sit down, Elvis. Please.

353
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:56,209
Will you just sit down and
stop embarrassing me!

354
00:30:56,287 --> 00:30:57,515
I'm okay.

355
00:30:57,589 --> 00:31:00,683
Okay, okay. You're creasing it.

356
00:31:00,758 --> 00:31:01,884
Sit.

357
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,621
Just sit down.

358
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:06,061
I'm okay.

359
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:09,999
All right. I'll sit.

360
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:11,966
Where are you going?

361
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:15,866
Hold on.

362
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:19,569
I had this custom made.

363
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:36,989
What?

364
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:39,396
What style do you like?

365
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:44,635
I like casual, but I usually wear suits.

366
00:31:44,702 --> 00:31:49,639
No, no. What kind of woman?

367
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:50,571
Woman?

368
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:56,808
I don't care.

369
00:31:56,881 --> 00:32:02,319
I might look at her character? Why?

370
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:07,487
By any chance...
Did someone ask you to ask me?

371
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:11,460
Tell them that for the next 3 months,
I'm only studying.

372
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:14,862
I won't have time for anything else,
so she should forget about me.

373
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,299
That's what I'd like to say,
but that would be bad manners.

374
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:20,701
Is she pretty?

375
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:24,074
In 3 months, I'll have a lot of time.

376
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:26,839
I wouldn't say pretty...

377
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:32,277
But she has a great character.

378
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:33,639
And she has little feet.

379
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:35,083
Is her English good?

380
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,455
A little.

381
00:32:43,594 --> 00:32:50,523
When I find a woman to love,
I'll confess to her in English.

382
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:56,898
"I love you" in Korean is so corny.

383
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,808
"I love you, darling."

384
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:02,635
English feels different, doesn't it?

385
00:33:03,047 --> 00:33:08,144
But if she doesn't understand English,
that would be embarrassing.

386
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:19,156
English, I will master you completely!

387
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:28,034
Come on, English!

388
00:33:28,606 --> 00:33:32,770
Come on Elvis!

389
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:37,144
I AM NOT NORMAL

390
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:39,206
What has she been drinking...

391
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:40,375
I'll call the police
if you don't get down!

392
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:42,316
I love you!

393
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,552
Honey, call the police! Now!

394
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:49,321
Good night. E-L-V-l-SSSSSSS!!!!!!

395
00:33:55,466 --> 00:34:02,269
I am the king of English!
Catherine! Wait! Coming soon!

396
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:05,075
Every gorgeous woman.

397
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:08,044
I'm Park Moon-Su.

398
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:13,414
Korean-American lawyer searching for birth mother
years after being adopted to the U.S.

399
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:16,378
Mom.

400
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:19,116
Mom, come on over here!

401
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,817
Come on, come on!

402
00:34:22,093 --> 00:34:25,654
You have to yell to speak English?

403
00:34:26,297 --> 00:34:29,164
You don't want to say anything
when you meet her?

404
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,990
You want to be a fool?

405
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,566
Your posture is important.

406
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,505
Bend your legs!

407
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:40,266
Straighten your back!

408
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:42,506
Hold your stomach in!

409
00:34:43,614 --> 00:34:44,546
Right?

410
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:50,385
I! LO VE! VICTORIA!

411
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,388
I...

412
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,188
Make your voice ring out through Seoul!

413
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:03,366
Don't be so timid!

414
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,763
Loudly this time.

415
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:09,737
- I!
- I!

416
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:11,733
LOVE!

417
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:14,775
- Victoria!
- Bacteria!

418
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:16,746
We're trying to sleep here!

419
00:35:17,348 --> 00:35:18,440
What the hell!

420
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:25,983
Yesterday... I worked on my English.

421
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:27,820
On a mountain top.

422
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:32,659
Elvis, you try.

423
00:35:33,197 --> 00:35:35,028
What did you do yesterday?

424
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:42,763
Very sorry.

425
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:48,737
So many absences! You can't
even answer simple questions.

426
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,809
If your English is bad,
you must study hard.

427
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:55,209
[Foundation-elementary level]
Foundation,,,

428
00:36:00,591 --> 00:36:04,652
Heavy traffic.

429
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:07,494
Do you have a problem with me?

430
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:10,932
Apologize quickly.

431
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:17,165
That's it. From now on you will speak
only English during this class.

432
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:19,141
Only English!

433
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:22,771
It will be difficult at first,
but if you try, you will get better.

434
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:27,250
Speaking Korean is not allowed in this class.
Only English!

435
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:34,054
I'm sorry.

436
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,990
What a temper.

437
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:39,488
I know.

438
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:40,931
Is it over?

439
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,809
Why isn't it coming?

440
00:36:57,782 --> 00:36:59,181
Is there a strike?

441
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:06,351
Elvis, you know...

442
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:09,122
Only English!

443
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:24,100
If you don't have anything
special to do this weekend

444
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:28,407
Would you like to go to a movie
on Saturday with me?

445
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:30,470
You understand?

446
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:35,817
She's asking what the
Saturday movie is.

447
00:37:35,886 --> 00:37:37,080
What was it?

448
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:39,989
No.

449
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:44,427
Hello.

450
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:47,698
Oh, Cathy. I am Elvis.

451
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:52,332
This phone is Cathy phone! Tonight?

452
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:57,636
No problem! Coming soon. Yes!

453
00:37:58,976 --> 00:38:01,877
Are you meeting Cathy?

454
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,913
You are... meeting her.

455
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:06,442
You're meeting Cathy.

456
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:07,841
Hey, taxi!!

457
00:38:09,186 --> 00:38:11,654
Go then.

458
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:16,623
He really went to see her.

459
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:27,927
Driver, follow that cab!

460
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:32,605
Are you mental? This is a bus.

461
00:38:37,915 --> 00:38:39,439
This is who I am!

462
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:43,276
A public official!

463
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:57,567
Where exactly do you work?

464
00:38:57,868 --> 00:39:01,167
Step on it! You'll lose him!

465
00:39:01,472 --> 00:39:05,568
Don't worry. No one has ever
shaken me off yet.

466
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:06,701
I'm getting off!

467
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:10,713
Driver!

468
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:37,197
Hey, Mike. You've been busy?

469
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,155
Excuse me? Excuse me

470
00:39:53,891 --> 00:40:03,823
Hi? Remember me? I'm the guy who had
the wrong electricity bill! Remember?

471
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,228
Hello?

472
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:12,833
Hi. Yeah. That got taken care of.
Did you do that?

473
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:17,471
You don't know what a problem
that was for me.

474
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:18,845
Do you want a drink?

475
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,819
Can you handle Whisky?

476
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:29,158
One glass, please.

477
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:31,354
Ladies and gentleman!

478
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:35,229
The talent guest you have
all been waiting for!

479
00:40:48,913 --> 00:40:50,175
You can call me Tony.

480
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:52,744
How can I address you?

481
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:55,377
Thank you!

482
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,949
No, No, How-can-l-address-you?

483
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:03,782
My Address?
Address?

484
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:06,626
Guro-dong.

485
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:09,522
Guro-dong! That's a beautiful name.

486
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,796
Nice to meet you Guro-dong. Cheers!

487
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:16,339
Me? Again?

488
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:24,014
She's had enough. She's drinking
everything he gives her.

489
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:28,483
Are you OK?

490
00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:32,550
Are you drunk?

491
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:37,018
Do you need to go home? Um...

492
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:42,195
If you want, I could drive you home.
I have a really nice car.

493
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:43,893
Thank you, Jessie!

494
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:46,232
Elvis, do you dance well?

495
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:47,595
Okay.

496
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:48,729
Is there anyone else?

497
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,971
Can you tap dance?

498
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:51,837
Sure!

499
00:41:53,544 --> 00:41:54,374
Come on.

500
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:55,605
Wait.

501
00:41:57,548 --> 00:42:01,609
Beautiful couple!
Cathy and Elvis will tap dance!

502
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:13,187
My technology!

503
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:21,326
What the hell is she doing?

504
00:44:01,605 --> 00:44:03,664
Are you okay?

505
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:10,772
Elvis... Run, quickly... Run... RUN!

506
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:12,111
Candy.

507
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:15,674
Can you get up?

508
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:29,588
What?

509
00:44:32,936 --> 00:44:34,130
What do you want?

510
00:44:40,811 --> 00:44:42,438
This is medicine.

511
00:44:43,714 --> 00:44:44,874
And this is soondae.

512
00:44:47,718 --> 00:44:48,742
And deokbokki.

513
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:52,677
And I made Korean pancakes.

514
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:55,622
Have all of it.

515
00:44:56,226 --> 00:44:57,420
What's all this?

516
00:45:00,964 --> 00:45:01,953
Candy!

517
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:09,435
Am I a bad teacher?

518
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:15,544
Do you like Elvis that much?

519
00:45:16,947 --> 00:45:18,471
It's carrot!
(Of course!)

520
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:23,481
I don't care for him.

521
00:45:25,022 --> 00:45:28,048
He's kind of cute, but he's not my type.

522
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:38,164
Cathy, you are my good friend!

523
00:45:43,373 --> 00:45:45,432
Help yourself.

524
00:45:50,147 --> 00:45:52,012
I don't know who that could be.

525
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:58,518
Tyson, what are you doing here?

526
00:45:58,589 --> 00:45:59,851
What's wrong with your head?

527
00:46:01,492 --> 00:46:03,255
Oh, Don't worry about it.

528
00:46:03,861 --> 00:46:08,798
You're far away from home.
I thought you might like this.

529
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,527
Thank you! I love pizza!

530
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:17,636
Candy's here, too. You want to come in?

531
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:20,136
I have more deliveries.

532
00:46:20,544 --> 00:46:21,977
Oh That's a shame!

533
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:24,406
Then see you later.

534
00:46:27,017 --> 00:46:28,507
You know... Cathy.

535
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:35,524
[Language reflects their personality.]

536
00:46:35,592 --> 00:46:37,355
You should learn to speak polite form.

537
00:46:38,362 --> 00:46:40,057
But it's so hard.

538
00:46:40,497 --> 00:46:44,092
If it's hard, just say "yoo" at the end.

539
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:45,560
You?

540
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:47,430
You?? I don't understand.

541
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:52,641
Like, this. I love yooooo...

542
00:46:55,946 --> 00:46:57,038
Bye.

543
00:47:02,853 --> 00:47:05,185
I love yooo...

544
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:15,025
I love yooo...

545
00:47:19,469 --> 00:47:22,404
You want more? You eat a lot!

546
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,398
No wonder your butt's so big.

547
00:47:29,813 --> 00:47:30,575
Hi, Cathy.

548
00:47:30,981 --> 00:47:32,744
Good evening everyone!

549
00:47:32,816 --> 00:47:34,613
Good evening, Cathy!

550
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:35,913
Please, look at the board.

551
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:39,014
These are your partners from now on.

552
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:41,950
Good?

553
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:46,921
But Cathy!

554
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:49,556
Sit down!

555
00:47:53,904 --> 00:47:54,768
Sit, sit sit.

556
00:47:54,838 --> 00:47:55,896
Why are you following me?

557
00:47:55,973 --> 00:47:57,031
We're partners.

558
00:47:57,107 --> 00:47:59,871
That's not final. Sit down here.

559
00:48:01,812 --> 00:48:09,878
At other institutes,
we changed partners every day.

560
00:48:09,953 --> 00:48:14,720
This man no good...
no change... no money...

561
00:48:16,927 --> 00:48:18,155
I want to change, too.

562
00:48:19,162 --> 00:48:21,926
Okay...
You can use Korean.

563
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:32,836
Stop!

564
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:38,139
We need teamwork to improve your English.

565
00:48:38,215 --> 00:48:43,346
Meet your partner often
outside of class and practice.

566
00:48:49,393 --> 00:48:52,362
Hi, we are team.

567
00:48:54,498 --> 00:48:55,590
Yes!

568
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:06,966
You don't want me as a partner?

569
00:49:07,411 --> 00:49:09,208
No. It's a good thing.

570
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,385
We're in class... You shouldn't...

571
00:49:19,089 --> 00:49:22,058
Let's think of only English!

572
00:49:22,426 --> 00:49:26,829
Candy, don't ever wear sexy clothes.
Let's study really really hard!

573
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:29,824
I don't wear sexy clothes.

574
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,892
That's right... Sorry.

575
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:33,934
You're welcome.

576
00:49:35,605 --> 00:49:36,503
Oh, no!

577
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:38,669
That's all right!

578
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:41,467
Thank you. - You're welcome.
Sorry. - That's all right.

579
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,177
This is annoying.

580
00:49:45,849 --> 00:49:50,047
How come you speak so well!

581
00:49:53,857 --> 00:49:57,293
You could be like me. Really.

582
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:49,106
Where are you from? Brazil?

583
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:53,711
No! I'm American.

584
00:50:54,451 --> 00:51:00,356
I know you. You are my sister Victoria!

585
00:51:00,824 --> 00:51:03,520
Yes, You're my brother Moon-su?

586
00:51:03,994 --> 00:51:06,690
Yes, I love you!

587
00:51:06,763 --> 00:51:09,254
Oh- Victoria,

588
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:13,201
Do you love your mother?

589
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:16,133
You're making a fool of yourself!

590
00:51:29,386 --> 00:51:32,753
Let's use only English at home!

591
00:51:35,992 --> 00:51:39,484
Nonsense! Turn it on,
before I get really nasty!

592
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:42,732
Mencius' mother moved three times
for her son's education!

593
00:51:43,066 --> 00:51:46,832
Maybe her kid was smart!

594
00:51:48,705 --> 00:51:50,229
Or I'll run away from home.

595
00:51:51,408 --> 00:51:53,501
Our daughter is studying so hard!

596
00:51:53,844 --> 00:51:55,903
I've never been so moved.

597
00:51:55,979 --> 00:51:57,241
Honey!

598
00:51:57,714 --> 00:51:59,272
Go on out then.

599
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:06,912
Then I'll just have to stop
giving you my paycheck.

600
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:08,587
Wait!

601
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:17,728
Darling...

602
00:52:24,608 --> 00:52:27,338
Okay, okay, okay. Puke?

603
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:29,738
No, no, no, no.

604
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:36,742
Okay, okay. Water. Water.

605
00:52:37,053 --> 00:52:38,520
Es, water!

606
00:52:40,457 --> 00:52:44,120
Yo, yo, yo. What's up, mommy.

607
00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:47,324
Basketball, get out of here.
Give me the money, please.

608
00:52:48,131 --> 00:52:50,224
- Water.
- What's up, Daddy!

609
00:52:50,867 --> 00:52:51,959
Who are you?

610
00:52:54,905 --> 00:52:56,099
Thank you.

611
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:59,031
Oops! Oh, I'm sorry.

612
00:53:00,477 --> 00:53:02,638
Where my stamp?

613
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:06,278
Oh, my goodness!

614
00:53:08,051 --> 00:53:09,848
Good-bye, child!

615
00:53:11,087 --> 00:53:12,884
Your English is terrible.

616
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:15,850
Try to speak in full sentences.

617
00:53:16,259 --> 00:53:18,887
That way you can improve your English.

618
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:24,430
Are you okay?

619
00:53:25,335 --> 00:53:27,667
Yes, no problem!

620
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:31,432
Oh, now it's time for me to study.

621
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:35,705
We have piles of notices to send out.
You can't go today!

622
00:53:36,646 --> 00:53:38,307
Young-Ju, you're going to class?

623
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:39,177
Es, sir!

624
00:53:45,956 --> 00:53:53,385
So we're neighbors but haven't seen
each other for a while, right?

625
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:54,921
That's right. Say something to your neighbor.

626
00:53:58,001 --> 00:53:59,901
Hey. Hi.

627
00:54:05,141 --> 00:54:07,371
- Hi.
- Yeah.

628
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:13,412
Why don't you say something?

629
00:54:14,217 --> 00:54:17,345
I'm so happy to see her that
I don't know what to say.

630
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:23,590
Just say anything. Candy, you go first.

631
00:54:25,662 --> 00:54:27,425
My mobile phone number is 011-3...

632
00:54:27,497 --> 00:54:28,896
Candy.

633
00:54:29,733 --> 00:54:35,103
Oh, sorry. My e-mail is w-o...

634
00:54:35,505 --> 00:54:36,802
Candy. That's enough.

635
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,930
Tyson and Betty. Your turn.

636
00:54:41,645 --> 00:54:47,777
What time is it now?
Did you have lunch?

637
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:57,484
Tyson! You have to speak out your
answers to improve your English.

638
00:54:58,895 --> 00:55:00,328
All right?

639
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:02,664
Yes. Cathy.

640
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:05,092
Yeah, go on. You don't need me.

641
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:11,338
Were you embarrassed back there?

642
00:55:11,675 --> 00:55:13,870
A little.

643
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:16,577
Sorry very much.

644
00:55:17,049 --> 00:55:22,612
Candy. It's "Thank you very much."
Not "Sorry very much".

645
00:55:23,122 --> 00:55:27,388
I mean, I'm not that good,
but you're really not improving.

646
00:55:28,561 --> 00:55:30,324
You have to admit my pronunciation
got better, right?

647
00:55:30,663 --> 00:55:36,898
I listen to CNN every night.
Now I understand almost 90%.

648
00:55:45,444 --> 00:55:48,743
Do you understand any of it?

649
00:55:56,055 --> 00:55:58,956
Understand, my ass.
I have to watch my soap opera.

650
00:55:59,325 --> 00:56:00,849
She looks like she understands...

651
00:56:00,926 --> 00:56:02,393
the way she's frowning and all.

652
00:56:05,798 --> 00:56:07,095
Mom, I'm home!

653
00:56:08,834 --> 00:56:10,802
Hurry up. Get in here.

654
00:56:12,004 --> 00:56:15,770
Who is it? Give me that.

655
00:56:16,742 --> 00:56:18,710
Hello?

656
00:56:20,713 --> 00:56:23,375
It's Moon-Young, isn't it?
It sounds like her voice.

657
00:56:23,682 --> 00:56:24,546
Be quiet!

658
00:56:25,084 --> 00:56:28,110
- Can you speak English?
- Okay!

659
00:56:28,521 --> 00:56:33,424
Good! It's only two weeks left.
And... I miss you. I miss you!

660
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,184
She say's she's "Miss Yoo".

661
00:56:35,261 --> 00:56:38,697
- Anyway, it's nice to hear your voice...
- Can't you say something in English?

662
00:56:38,964 --> 00:56:41,455
I AM speaking in English.
Okay? It's English, too!

663
00:56:41,534 --> 00:56:43,866
Hello? Hello?

664
00:56:45,237 --> 00:56:47,728
What do... how do?

665
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:49,072
What?

666
00:56:50,509 --> 00:56:52,306
What is your Saturday movie?

667
00:56:52,778 --> 00:56:54,973
Can you hold? I'll get someone else.

668
00:56:56,082 --> 00:56:58,380
Hello? I'm Luna Kim.

669
00:56:58,717 --> 00:57:00,446
Victoria wants me to say hello
to her mother.

670
00:57:02,688 --> 00:57:06,624
Why couldn't I remember "How do you do?"

671
00:57:11,297 --> 00:57:12,855
I'm not going to meet her.

672
00:57:14,967 --> 00:57:17,060
How could I look her in the eye?

673
00:57:17,970 --> 00:57:19,096
What is it now?

674
00:57:20,306 --> 00:57:25,972
When your father ran off
with another woman...

675
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:30,976
I wasn't sure I could
raise you two by myself.

676
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:33,945
But the more I think about it,

677
00:57:35,588 --> 00:57:43,996
I should have raised you both,
if I had been a good mother.

678
00:57:44,597 --> 00:57:45,723
Not again!

679
00:57:46,966 --> 00:57:52,029
I'm sick and tired of
learning English, too.

680
00:57:53,806 --> 00:57:59,005
Good. We both could have
made a huge mistake.

681
00:58:00,613 --> 00:58:05,277
You shouldn't have had her
if you couldn't raise her.

682
00:58:06,152 --> 00:58:08,017
You shouldn't have looked for her
if you were going to give her away.

683
00:58:08,387 --> 00:58:10,514
What is this!

684
00:58:16,362 --> 00:58:26,294
I would have thrown you away
if I'd known you'd be like your father!

685
00:58:42,288 --> 00:58:48,818
Yeah, keep going.
Take all my money while you're at it.

686
00:59:10,249 --> 00:59:11,876
It's for you.

687
00:59:16,155 --> 00:59:19,215
Hello. This is Young-Ju's cell phone.

688
00:59:20,826 --> 00:59:21,815
Candy?

689
00:59:23,362 --> 00:59:26,229
Who on earth is making crank
calls at this hour?

690
00:59:26,565 --> 00:59:28,999
What, Elvis?

691
00:59:29,969 --> 00:59:32,233
If you're Elvis, I'm Nam Jin.

692
00:59:33,372 --> 00:59:37,399
Listen. "In a green field..."

693
00:59:43,682 --> 00:59:44,740
Hello.

694
00:59:59,098 --> 01:00:00,156
Candy!

695
01:00:03,569 --> 01:00:04,593
Are you cold?

696
01:00:05,871 --> 01:00:08,840
No! Not at all.

697
01:00:09,708 --> 01:00:11,073
I called too late, didn't I?

698
01:00:11,377 --> 01:00:13,470
No, it's only one o'clock.

699
01:00:14,847 --> 01:00:17,975
I can't believe you came out
just because I asked you to.

700
01:00:18,651 --> 01:00:19,879
Of course!

701
01:00:21,987 --> 01:00:25,514
I was dreaming about you.

702
01:00:25,858 --> 01:00:30,192
And then you called. Strange, isn't it?

703
01:00:32,031 --> 01:00:33,555
Why was I in your dream?

704
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:35,790
It's not like I have nowhere to go.

705
01:00:36,302 --> 01:00:39,271
We were studying in class as usual.

706
01:00:40,873 --> 01:00:41,601
Open.

707
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:04,393
We're taking over this building.

708
01:01:04,763 --> 01:01:09,097
Drop all your weapons.
You're under arrest.

709
01:01:10,602 --> 01:01:13,070
Drop all your weapons.
You're under arrest.

710
01:01:35,527 --> 01:01:38,360
Shut up! We will now conduct a level test.

711
01:01:38,630 --> 01:01:43,294
Failure to answer will result
in the gas chamber. Do you understand?

712
01:01:53,045 --> 01:01:53,875
You!

713
01:01:54,847 --> 01:01:55,370
Me?

714
01:01:55,781 --> 01:01:57,510
What kind of woman do you like?

715
01:01:58,150 --> 01:02:01,813
I like gorgeous woman!

716
01:02:02,755 --> 01:02:05,053
Passed! Stand up!

717
01:02:08,026 --> 01:02:11,154
- You!
- You talking to me?

718
01:02:11,730 --> 01:02:13,823
Shut up! Just answer me in English!

719
01:02:14,566 --> 01:02:16,227
What is your favorite movie?

720
01:02:17,536 --> 01:02:18,127
What?

721
01:02:22,541 --> 01:02:26,944
Listen carefully!
WHAT-IS-YOUR-FAVORITE-MO VIE?

722
01:02:27,446 --> 01:02:30,904
M-O-V-l-E, MO VIE!

723
01:02:35,821 --> 01:02:38,085
Oh~! Movie!

724
01:02:40,125 --> 01:02:41,217
Quiet!

725
01:02:43,829 --> 01:02:45,558
Zero-Zero-Seven!

726
01:02:46,331 --> 01:02:48,629
Double-O Seven. You mean James Bond?

727
01:02:49,735 --> 01:02:49,996
Yes!

728
01:02:54,940 --> 01:02:56,134
Why?

729
01:03:02,181 --> 01:03:07,084
Elvis! Help me! Elvis!

730
01:03:07,352 --> 01:03:09,820
SOS!

731
01:03:10,923 --> 01:03:14,825
I'll be back!

732
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:18,086
Why did you pick that movie
when you couldn't even explain?

733
01:03:18,497 --> 01:03:20,328
Have you ever dreamt about me?

734
01:03:20,432 --> 01:03:21,091
What?!!!

735
01:03:21,467 --> 01:03:24,925
You have, haven't you?
You dreamt about me!

736
01:03:25,437 --> 01:03:27,166
Just once.

737
01:03:28,373 --> 01:03:30,466
I was so shocked because you were in it.

738
01:03:33,512 --> 01:03:34,171
Why?

739
01:03:35,547 --> 01:03:40,075
It was a beach in Miami, not Korea.

740
01:03:48,093 --> 01:03:50,391
My Emmi Restaurant
[(Mom's Sushi Bar)]

741
01:04:01,173 --> 01:04:04,165
No way. I don't wear bikinis.

742
01:04:05,277 --> 01:04:08,075
Just listen. It's my dream!

743
01:04:08,947 --> 01:04:13,441
You looked really gorgeous in my dream.

744
01:04:15,087 --> 01:04:16,952
Unfortunately, you were sleeping.

745
01:04:17,856 --> 01:04:20,791
Then you saw me naked!

746
01:04:21,627 --> 01:04:23,561
You had a swimsuit on.
It was a bikini!

747
01:04:24,396 --> 01:04:26,057
I couldn't help myself.

748
01:04:26,331 --> 01:04:29,596
I have to touch this woman.
I have no choice. Just do it!

749
01:04:30,202 --> 01:04:31,635
Never! Never!

750
01:04:33,639 --> 01:04:34,367
That's it.

751
01:04:34,773 --> 01:04:36,900
Elvis, never stop.

752
01:04:38,076 --> 01:04:39,338
To be continued.

753
01:04:46,552 --> 01:04:50,682
[To take off her clothing]

754
01:04:50,756 --> 01:05:02,429
D. None of the above.

755
01:05:02,501 --> 01:05:03,331
A.

756
01:05:03,535 --> 01:05:05,298
Oh, my goodness! You stripped me naked!

757
01:05:05,737 --> 01:05:08,035
I checked the dictionary after I woke up.

758
01:05:09,174 --> 01:05:10,402
The answer was B.

759
01:05:12,077 --> 01:05:16,104
Then nothing happened.

760
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:19,877
You wanted me to strip you?

761
01:05:19,952 --> 01:05:24,651
Of course not.
How could you get that wrong?

762
01:05:26,258 --> 01:05:33,494
It's fun talking to you
late into the night.

763
01:05:38,670 --> 01:05:40,103
Really?

764
01:05:44,276 --> 01:05:46,608
Why do you like talking to me?

765
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:50,448
When I look at you...

766
01:05:51,883 --> 01:05:54,147
I don't think of women.

767
01:05:54,987 --> 01:06:00,550
So it's really comfortable.
All I think of is studying English.

768
01:06:17,442 --> 01:06:18,636
You're leaving?

769
01:06:37,195 --> 01:06:40,028
This isn't your bedroom.

770
01:06:40,499 --> 01:06:42,126
Why are you sleeping out here?
It's embarrassing.

771
01:06:43,602 --> 01:06:46,537
Lower your voice. Everyone's sleeping.

772
01:06:47,372 --> 01:06:48,862
Who's listening?

773
01:06:49,541 --> 01:06:52,635
Is this loud? Then say so!

774
01:06:52,711 --> 01:06:53,973
What will I do with you!

775
01:06:54,246 --> 01:06:55,304
Would you stop hitting me?

776
01:07:01,453 --> 01:07:02,977
Did you eat?

777
01:07:06,491 --> 01:07:09,051
No, you were probably chasing some girl.

778
01:07:10,028 --> 01:07:13,486
How come you turn silly
at the sight of every skirt?

779
01:07:14,433 --> 01:07:17,596
At least your dad had taste. He had me.

780
01:07:19,104 --> 01:07:22,005
I'm sick of that story.

781
01:07:24,276 --> 01:07:29,270
There are plenty of good girls after me.

782
01:07:29,347 --> 01:07:32,544
You'd want any of them
to be your daughter-in-law.

783
01:07:33,819 --> 01:07:39,189
You see what you want to see.
I doubt there's anyone decent.

784
01:07:39,891 --> 01:07:43,793
There's a public official, you know!

785
01:07:45,097 --> 01:07:48,089
A public official? Who is she?

786
01:07:49,101 --> 01:07:50,295
That's enough. Let's go in.

787
01:07:51,069 --> 01:07:51,899
How old is she?

788
01:07:53,371 --> 01:07:56,829
I'm teaching her English.
She's not that bad.

789
01:07:57,342 --> 01:07:58,331
So how old is she!

790
01:08:00,611 --> 01:08:02,841
Doesn't think of women.

791
01:08:06,617 --> 01:08:09,085
Doesn't think of women.

792
01:08:17,895 --> 01:08:19,123
See me as a woman.

793
01:08:20,998 --> 01:08:23,330
See me as a woman.

794
01:08:25,870 --> 01:08:27,360
See me as a woman.

795
01:08:29,273 --> 01:08:30,604
What are you mumbling?

796
01:08:31,375 --> 01:08:33,366
I see it in your eyes. You want me.

797
01:08:34,812 --> 01:08:38,771
Your eyes look really big
without your glasses!

798
01:08:39,250 --> 01:08:42,742
I get that a lot.

799
01:08:43,621 --> 01:08:47,887
People say they could dive in
because they're like lakes.

800
01:08:49,126 --> 01:08:50,115
Now that I look closely...

801
01:08:52,563 --> 01:08:54,793
You look just like an alien!

802
01:08:55,199 --> 01:08:57,690
Their faces are this small
and have almond-shaped eyes!

803
01:08:59,069 --> 01:09:00,400
Doesn't everyone say that?

804
01:09:07,077 --> 01:09:11,446
Everyone. Look at me! We're going
on a picnic this weekend.

805
01:09:11,982 --> 01:09:14,974
My foreign friends are going, too.

806
01:09:18,222 --> 01:09:20,747
We're going to Candy's
grandfather's house.

807
01:09:25,129 --> 01:09:28,292
I hear it's in a beautiful village.

808
01:09:28,933 --> 01:09:31,299
Then we have to stay overnight!

809
01:09:31,769 --> 01:09:32,861
I can't stay out overnight.

810
01:09:33,471 --> 01:09:34,335
Candy

811
01:09:34,905 --> 01:09:35,894
Stop!

812
01:09:43,380 --> 01:09:48,181
My grandfather has a famous pig.

813
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:54,448
It was on the news. Didn't you see it?

814
01:09:55,659 --> 01:09:56,421
Did you see it?

815
01:09:59,063 --> 01:10:02,726
The pig that understands English.

816
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:05,064
What kind of pig is that?

817
01:10:06,103 --> 01:10:12,372
Well, you spread letters on the ground.

818
01:10:12,743 --> 01:10:16,474
You say "A!" and it brings the A.
You say "B!" and it brings the B.

819
01:10:18,048 --> 01:10:24,476
It even knows some words, too.

820
01:10:25,489 --> 01:10:26,751
No way!

821
01:10:28,392 --> 01:10:29,825
Really!

822
01:10:34,164 --> 01:10:36,132
There are so many of you.

823
01:10:37,735 --> 01:10:40,295
Nice to meet you.

824
01:10:41,639 --> 01:10:43,504
Are these all your friends?

825
01:10:44,141 --> 01:10:48,100
There're all shapes and sizes.

826
01:10:48,646 --> 01:10:53,379
These are my classmates, and the
foreigners just came along.

827
01:10:53,450 --> 01:10:55,077
This is Cathy, our English teacher.

828
01:10:55,686 --> 01:11:00,248
Thank you for teaching our
little granddaughter, Ma'am.

829
01:11:00,324 --> 01:11:01,655
It's nice to meet you!

830
01:11:03,193 --> 01:11:05,661
Why, this woman...

831
01:11:06,063 --> 01:11:07,325
Thank you, too!

832
01:11:09,133 --> 01:11:12,227
Grandma, how have you been?

833
01:11:13,737 --> 01:11:14,601
It's been ages.

834
01:11:14,972 --> 01:11:17,770
Candy, where's the famous pig?

835
01:11:18,108 --> 01:11:18,802
Yeah, that pig?

836
01:11:24,081 --> 01:11:30,384
It was here, but we ate it
at the last village party.

837
01:11:31,722 --> 01:11:37,490
Oh, my God! Why eat such
a great pig? Why?

838
01:11:38,729 --> 01:11:39,821
You made it up, didn't you?

839
01:11:41,265 --> 01:11:42,425
No, I didn't.

840
01:11:43,334 --> 01:11:48,067
I thought there really was a pig
that knew English.

841
01:11:56,513 --> 01:11:59,880
I need to ask a favor. It's real easy.

842
01:11:59,950 --> 01:12:02,919
Just memorize a few letters.

843
01:12:04,755 --> 01:12:09,385
I have to show Moon-Su I wasn't lying.

844
01:12:11,929 --> 01:12:15,729
I suggest you cooperate quietly.

845
01:12:17,468 --> 01:12:18,127
Why? No?

846
01:12:19,637 --> 01:12:22,970
Do you know I like bacon?
[Pork rib.,, bacon.]

847
01:12:27,244 --> 01:12:31,180
A looks like this. Easy, isn't it?

848
01:12:31,248 --> 01:12:37,778
And these are B and C.
They're easy to tell apart.

849
01:12:38,422 --> 01:12:42,882
Pick one of the three. C!

850
01:12:45,396 --> 01:12:47,296
Oh, you pig!

851
01:12:50,234 --> 01:12:52,464
What are you doing here?

852
01:12:57,408 --> 01:12:58,397
You have something in your eye?

853
01:12:58,475 --> 01:13:00,807
No. They're originally like this.

854
01:13:02,046 --> 01:13:04,480
You have to try a different
teaching method. Be gentle.

855
01:13:14,925 --> 01:13:15,448
Give me that.

856
01:13:18,429 --> 01:13:22,627
What a sexy sow you are.
Boars must drool over you!

857
01:13:23,534 --> 01:13:25,263
Hey, you want to have some fun
with this handsome guy?

858
01:13:26,670 --> 01:13:29,070
Which one is 'A'?

859
01:13:29,139 --> 01:13:31,073
A. A. Go on.

860
01:13:32,743 --> 01:13:34,574
Don't shake it. She won't come.

861
01:13:35,646 --> 01:13:40,515
That's it!

862
01:13:56,066 --> 01:13:57,499
She's running away!

863
01:13:57,868 --> 01:13:58,664
Young-Ju!

864
01:14:00,037 --> 01:14:03,438
There she is! Stop right there!

865
01:14:10,848 --> 01:14:11,439
There she is.

866
01:14:15,552 --> 01:14:16,519
Elvis, grab her!

867
01:14:42,012 --> 01:14:43,001
Where are your shoes?

868
01:14:43,413 --> 01:14:45,278
I lost them while I was running.

869
01:14:46,016 --> 01:14:47,779
That was clumsy of you.

870
01:14:51,155 --> 01:14:53,851
Why do you squint like that?

871
01:14:54,224 --> 01:14:57,557
I kept them open extra-wide before.

872
01:15:06,136 --> 01:15:07,603
It's bleeding!

873
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:10,800
It's all right.

874
01:15:10,874 --> 01:15:11,932
No. It's not all right.

875
01:15:13,777 --> 01:15:14,368
Get on my back.

876
01:15:15,379 --> 01:15:19,748
I'm fine. I'm too embarrassed.

877
01:15:22,085 --> 01:15:22,915
Come on.

878
01:15:33,931 --> 01:15:34,625
I'm heavy, aren't I?

879
01:15:40,070 --> 01:15:45,064
Keep your eyes open
comfortably from now on.

880
01:15:51,748 --> 01:15:52,510
Okay.

881
01:16:03,527 --> 01:16:05,927
I was heavy, wasn't I?

882
01:16:08,832 --> 01:16:12,131
Yeah.

883
01:16:27,184 --> 01:16:32,645
Go Candy!

884
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,199
How did you find them?

885
01:17:19,836 --> 01:17:23,033
I used to be a scout. A boy scout.

886
01:17:23,273 --> 01:17:26,640
Thank you so much!

887
01:17:27,611 --> 01:17:29,044
Shall I get you a pair of shoes?

888
01:17:29,546 --> 01:17:30,604
Oh, no.

889
01:17:32,616 --> 01:17:39,419
Do you have red ones?
I've always wanted red ones.

890
01:17:39,723 --> 01:17:42,191
I'll get you ten pairs so you can
wear them for life!

891
01:17:42,659 --> 01:17:43,284
Really?

892
01:17:48,532 --> 01:17:49,658
You cold?

893
01:17:52,269 --> 01:17:53,531
No cold.

894
01:18:04,614 --> 01:18:07,276
Happy!

895
01:18:11,121 --> 01:18:14,454
Good people in this scenic village

896
01:18:14,524 --> 01:18:19,791
The fresh air and the peaceful silence

897
01:18:19,863 --> 01:18:23,594
It opens up my heart.

898
01:18:25,102 --> 01:18:27,161
Me, too.

899
01:18:29,473 --> 01:18:36,276
I wish to live like the wind and clouds!

900
01:18:37,414 --> 01:18:39,575
Me too.

901
01:18:40,717 --> 01:18:42,207
That doesn't seem like you.

902
01:18:44,855 --> 01:18:45,879
I was just kidding.

903
01:18:48,091 --> 01:18:50,992
I know I don't seem like that.

904
01:18:52,229 --> 01:18:57,929
Plain, boring, and not sexy.

905
01:18:58,001 --> 01:18:59,491
Stop that!

906
01:19:01,505 --> 01:19:07,967
Ou did at first, but I take back
what I said about you being normal.

907
01:19:09,179 --> 01:19:12,842
You're different, you know.

908
01:19:16,753 --> 01:19:17,742
Special?

909
01:19:20,157 --> 01:19:23,820
I'm special to you?

910
01:19:26,563 --> 01:19:29,828
You could say that.

911
01:19:34,337 --> 01:19:44,212
Don't you want to say
something in English?

912
01:19:45,015 --> 01:19:46,846
Not yet.

913
01:19:49,986 --> 01:19:52,079
Then when?

914
01:19:52,756 --> 01:19:54,053
After I learn more.

915
01:20:01,465 --> 01:20:02,591
Let's go in.

916
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:03,657
Okay.

917
01:20:10,006 --> 01:20:11,098
Goodnight, Young-Ju.

918
01:20:27,390 --> 01:20:28,914
I found it in the yard.

919
01:20:29,459 --> 01:20:30,824
When did that fall out?

920
01:20:32,329 --> 01:20:35,856
I saw the picture. She's hot.

921
01:20:38,268 --> 01:20:39,064
Yeah.

922
01:20:40,504 --> 01:20:41,493
What does she do?

923
01:20:42,072 --> 01:20:43,130
She's a lawyer in New York.

924
01:20:43,740 --> 01:20:45,799
Her English is great.

925
01:20:46,276 --> 01:20:49,336
Americans get frustrated talking to her
because her pronunciation is so good.

926
01:20:51,648 --> 01:20:55,448
That's why you learn English.

927
01:20:55,852 --> 01:20:56,841
Yes.

928
01:20:58,455 --> 01:20:59,786
I want to see her.

929
01:21:07,764 --> 01:21:09,391
Sun Tzu's The Art of War states that...

930
01:21:09,666 --> 01:21:14,000
knowing the enemy brings victory.

931
01:21:14,538 --> 01:21:15,869
Let's go for lunch.

932
01:21:16,139 --> 01:21:18,937
Age? A little younger than me.

933
01:21:19,609 --> 01:21:22,578
I bet she had her face done.

934
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:30,345
But English... No contest!

935
01:21:32,856 --> 01:21:36,553
I've lost the will to fight
now that I know my enemy.

936
01:21:42,432 --> 01:21:43,763
Orange juice please.

937
01:21:43,833 --> 01:21:45,960
No, we have only coffee.

938
01:21:48,004 --> 01:21:51,098
Okay, milk coffee please.

939
01:21:51,174 --> 01:21:52,368
No. We have no milk.

940
01:22:05,322 --> 01:22:06,755
You're cutting class today, too?

941
01:22:07,724 --> 01:22:09,589
You got dumped, didn't you?

942
01:22:10,393 --> 01:22:12,020
So you're quitting altogether?

943
01:22:12,896 --> 01:22:18,163
How are your classes going?

944
01:22:22,505 --> 01:22:26,441
I'm not going back. No, I can't.

945
01:22:28,712 --> 01:22:30,509
Why is it a disgrace not
to be able to speak English?

946
01:22:30,981 --> 01:22:33,176
I was never uncomfortable
not knowing any English until now.

947
01:22:34,084 --> 01:22:35,881
You use it maybe one week
in all the years you study it.

948
01:22:36,253 --> 01:22:38,915
It's crazy!

949
01:22:41,691 --> 01:22:48,927
I gave up on English but
I got a perfect score in Korean!

950
01:22:51,234 --> 01:22:56,968
If you pressure me, I'll file
a complaint with City Hall!

951
01:22:58,575 --> 01:22:59,872
I didn't say anything.

952
01:23:15,792 --> 01:23:18,260
Is something wrong with them?

953
01:23:19,162 --> 01:23:20,026
No, no.

954
01:23:22,365 --> 01:23:23,127
Weird.

955
01:23:36,813 --> 01:23:38,075
What are you doing here so late?

956
01:23:39,883 --> 01:23:42,317
It's the last week of class...

957
01:23:43,219 --> 01:23:44,413
You have to come tomorrow.

958
01:23:45,322 --> 01:23:45,947
No.

959
01:23:46,923 --> 01:23:47,651
Why?

960
01:23:49,125 --> 01:23:50,023
I hate English.

961
01:23:51,094 --> 01:23:52,891
It's Elvis. Isn't it?

962
01:23:54,197 --> 01:23:56,859
What happened between you two anyway?

963
01:23:57,434 --> 01:23:58,833
Stop talking about him.

964
01:24:00,737 --> 01:24:05,606
I know you are good teacher, good friend,

965
01:24:05,675 --> 01:24:09,873
but from now stay out of my life.

966
01:24:10,213 --> 01:24:11,680
It's none of your business.

967
01:24:16,019 --> 01:24:19,716
Candy... I am sorry.

968
01:24:21,124 --> 01:24:21,920
What?

969
01:24:28,398 --> 01:24:32,300
Young-Ju, you are not the
person I thought you were!

970
01:24:34,871 --> 01:24:40,810
And you know... For someone
who says they hate English,

971
01:24:40,877 --> 01:24:42,708
you speak it very well.

972
01:25:06,803 --> 01:25:10,796
Today, I'm just going to ask you
some questions about your plans.

973
01:25:11,608 --> 01:25:14,475
Remember to answer in English. Jolie?

974
01:25:16,212 --> 01:25:17,042
Oh, yes.

975
01:25:18,581 --> 01:25:20,344
I have a plan...

976
01:25:21,718 --> 01:25:22,446
Oh! Candy!

977
01:25:22,819 --> 01:25:23,183
Hey!

978
01:25:23,253 --> 01:25:24,413
Young-Ju is here.

979
01:25:26,423 --> 01:25:28,653
I thought you'd given up.

980
01:25:29,859 --> 01:25:33,192
Hey! Welcome, my partner!

981
01:25:35,565 --> 01:25:39,433
Don't use English when
you can't speak it well.

982
01:25:41,771 --> 01:25:46,731
And stop taking an interest in me.

983
01:25:48,511 --> 01:25:51,639
So many men want me.

984
01:25:53,416 --> 01:25:57,978
Maybe I should date a negative
speaker. (She means native speaker)

985
01:26:00,457 --> 01:26:03,824
- Long time no see!
- I miss you...

986
01:26:04,194 --> 01:26:06,162
Everybody, tomorrow is our last class,

987
01:26:06,229 --> 01:26:09,255
so why don't we all go out together and celebrate.

988
01:26:09,833 --> 01:26:11,460
I have one suggestion!

989
01:26:12,502 --> 01:26:16,165
I quit the pizza place and now
I work in a Korean restaurant.

990
01:26:16,239 --> 01:26:17,570
I'll buy all of you lunch.

991
01:26:22,245 --> 01:26:23,075
Really!

992
01:26:24,113 --> 01:26:26,377
You're coming tomorrow?

993
01:26:27,250 --> 01:26:32,620
I don't think I can.
That meeting is tomorrow.

994
01:26:32,689 --> 01:26:33,883
Please.

995
01:26:35,024 --> 01:26:35,888
I'll try.

996
01:26:36,459 --> 01:26:38,427
Your English is really good now.

997
01:26:45,101 --> 01:26:46,500
I was bad.

998
01:26:47,704 --> 01:26:50,002
No, it was for the best.

999
01:26:50,740 --> 01:26:51,866
I'll be over him in no time.

1000
01:26:53,176 --> 01:26:54,370
Game is over.

1001
01:26:57,146 --> 01:26:58,238
Moon-Su!

1002
01:27:18,301 --> 01:27:21,395
Nice to meet you.
Call me brother Moon-Su.

1003
01:27:21,471 --> 01:27:25,373
Nice to meet you.
I'm your brother.

1004
01:27:26,676 --> 01:27:29,167
Try on the suit you'll be wearing.

1005
01:27:31,514 --> 01:27:33,379
I'm picking it up at the
dry cleaner's at noon.

1006
01:27:35,251 --> 01:27:38,015
Is this for Moon-Young?

1007
01:27:39,422 --> 01:27:40,582
No, it's for someone else.

1008
01:27:42,292 --> 01:27:43,486
You're at it again.

1009
01:27:44,827 --> 01:27:45,816
Another girl?

1010
01:27:46,496 --> 01:27:48,987
You worry about your problems.

1011
01:27:50,133 --> 01:27:51,930
Stop worrying about everything else.

1012
01:27:52,468 --> 01:27:54,629
Don't talk to me like that.

1013
01:27:55,872 --> 01:27:58,602
You're giving them to that
public official, aren't you?

1014
01:28:00,109 --> 01:28:02,304
You got it all wrong.

1015
01:28:03,379 --> 01:28:04,903
She couldn't be further from my mind.

1016
01:28:05,615 --> 01:28:13,818
That's the problem with you.
You don't see what you have.

1017
01:28:15,992 --> 01:28:18,790
If you buy a woman shoes,
she'll run off in them.

1018
01:28:20,863 --> 01:28:23,991
Where are you going? Moon-Su!

1019
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:25,332
I'll be right back.

1020
01:28:27,637 --> 01:28:28,001
How is it?

1021
01:28:28,071 --> 01:28:29,095
It's really good.

1022
01:28:30,573 --> 01:28:34,236
This pork is simply delicious.

1023
01:28:35,878 --> 01:28:37,311
But where's Elvis?

1024
01:28:37,947 --> 01:28:39,209
I think he said he had an appointment.

1025
01:28:40,483 --> 01:28:41,916
How do you say "sambap" in English?

1026
01:28:42,385 --> 01:28:44,046
Do they have "sambap" in America?

1027
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:46,545
Wouldn't they call it "sam-rice"?

1028
01:28:46,623 --> 01:28:48,784
It's "sambap" in English, too.

1029
01:28:50,293 --> 01:28:52,352
I was eating that when
I got picked to learn English.

1030
01:29:12,849 --> 01:29:14,510
Candy isn't a size 5!

1031
01:29:17,387 --> 01:29:20,481
Hong, is there a size 6 of red strip shoes?

1032
01:29:20,556 --> 01:29:22,183
Yeah, bring them over.
"Victory Soccer Team Ladies' Shoe Dept"

1033
01:29:23,226 --> 01:29:27,856
Why? I can't. I'm in a jogging suit.

1034
01:29:31,234 --> 01:29:32,166
Taxi!

1035
01:29:36,673 --> 01:29:39,938
His name is Park Moon-Su
and he's not bad looking.

1036
01:29:40,943 --> 01:29:42,968
He's in my class,
but he didn't come today.

1037
01:29:43,846 --> 01:29:44,676
He's not here either?

1038
01:29:44,747 --> 01:29:45,338
No.

1039
01:29:45,848 --> 01:29:46,712
Then where is he?

1040
01:29:46,783 --> 01:29:49,149
Candy, she's looking for Moon-Su.

1041
01:29:49,218 --> 01:29:51,482
She would know.

1042
01:29:51,954 --> 01:29:52,648
Hey.

1043
01:29:54,157 --> 01:29:55,647
Are you the public official?

1044
01:29:58,127 --> 01:29:59,151
You know me?

1045
01:29:59,562 --> 01:30:01,120
Could you find my good-for-nothing son?

1046
01:30:01,564 --> 01:30:05,728
I have to go to Amiga or Omega Hotel with him.

1047
01:30:06,035 --> 01:30:09,004
Wait till I get my hands on him!

1048
01:30:12,008 --> 01:30:13,873
Could you take me there?

1049
01:30:34,230 --> 01:30:35,959
The girl from the picture?

1050
01:30:36,032 --> 01:30:38,227
Getting engaged already?

1051
01:30:39,602 --> 01:30:40,432
Let's go!

1052
01:30:47,376 --> 01:30:50,106
She doesn't look as good as
in the picture.

1053
01:30:50,947 --> 01:30:56,613
Mother? I'm Victoria.
Please, have a seat.

1054
01:30:57,086 --> 01:31:02,217
Mother? You're not even married.
You cow!

1055
01:31:03,559 --> 01:31:08,019
Okay, I sit. Because Mother want.

1056
01:31:08,498 --> 01:31:11,865
Oh, you speak English. Good. Translate for me.

1057
01:31:16,906 --> 01:31:17,873
Please don't cry.

1058
01:31:18,741 --> 01:31:20,936
Past is past. I don't remember anything.

1059
01:31:21,577 --> 01:31:23,772
I just came here to say hello...

1060
01:31:23,846 --> 01:31:25,780
It's good to see you.

1061
01:31:29,952 --> 01:31:32,443
Tell her this first.

1062
01:31:33,923 --> 01:31:38,223
I didn't do it because I hated you.

1063
01:31:39,829 --> 01:31:41,626
I deserve to be punished.

1064
01:31:42,231 --> 01:31:44,392
My mind has never been at ease.

1065
01:31:46,435 --> 01:31:52,101
Wondering if you're eating well,
if people were good to you.

1066
01:31:52,542 --> 01:31:55,409
That's too long.

1067
01:31:56,145 --> 01:31:59,706
Tell her everything. Please!

1068
01:32:01,217 --> 01:32:02,206
What did she say?

1069
01:32:04,954 --> 01:32:06,581
Hmm... Mother said...

1070
01:32:07,290 --> 01:32:11,249
What's "punished"? "furnished"?

1071
01:32:11,327 --> 01:32:12,624
Please tell her not to cry.

1072
01:32:13,563 --> 01:32:17,590
You be quiet. She cry because of you!

1073
01:32:19,735 --> 01:32:21,965
Isn't that too short?

1074
01:32:24,240 --> 01:32:27,004
English is like that.

1075
01:32:28,611 --> 01:32:37,485
Did you say she's pretty?
And thanks for growing up well?

1076
01:32:39,255 --> 01:32:40,415
That's...

1077
01:32:42,959 --> 01:32:47,658
She said you are beautiful.

1078
01:32:48,231 --> 01:32:50,563
But, the picture is better.

1079
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:52,224
What?

1080
01:32:55,271 --> 01:32:57,762
You stay here.

1081
01:33:07,516 --> 01:33:10,849
I don't think I introduced
myself... Hi... I'm Victoria.

1082
01:33:18,895 --> 01:33:21,090
What's wrong? Is it me?

1083
01:33:22,899 --> 01:33:24,230
You think I shouldn't have come?

1084
01:33:32,141 --> 01:33:33,108
Yes!

1085
01:33:35,211 --> 01:33:36,678
Did you say yes?

1086
01:33:37,847 --> 01:33:38,871
Yes.

1087
01:33:40,449 --> 01:33:44,545
Mother hate you. Moon-su hate you.
And everybody hate you.

1088
01:33:45,254 --> 01:33:46,846
Why?

1089
01:33:47,456 --> 01:33:53,725
Why?? Because... Because...
You are not Korean!

1090
01:33:58,734 --> 01:34:03,637
Ok! Tell her I came with good intentions.

1091
01:34:04,640 --> 01:34:09,839
And that I hope she's happy.

1092
01:34:13,749 --> 01:34:18,345
You might as well go sightseeing
since you're here already...

1093
01:34:46,248 --> 01:34:47,146
Good day, sir.

1094
01:35:09,138 --> 01:35:11,766
I told them not to write this on the back.

1095
01:35:12,508 --> 01:35:16,808
Or at least have it in English.
Soccer team for ladies!

1096
01:35:17,980 --> 01:35:19,607
I can't do anything with this.

1097
01:35:22,184 --> 01:35:24,152
Hi. Victoria.

1098
01:35:24,220 --> 01:35:25,414
I'm Elvis.

1099
01:35:25,921 --> 01:35:27,149
Nice to meet you.

1100
01:35:33,863 --> 01:35:35,888
I love you. Victoria.

1101
01:35:38,267 --> 01:35:42,363
I love you, too.

1102
01:35:47,676 --> 01:35:52,545
I didn't mean to do that to that girl.

1103
01:35:54,850 --> 01:36:04,157
I just blurt out things
before I think about them.

1104
01:36:04,527 --> 01:36:07,189
I'm not a bad person.

1105
01:36:09,065 --> 01:36:10,259
I'm sorry, Moon-Su!

1106
01:36:20,810 --> 01:36:24,075
What are you talking about?
She said she was staying here.

1107
01:36:24,346 --> 01:36:28,214
We have no Bacteria or Bacterium
staying at our hotel.

1108
01:36:28,284 --> 01:36:31,947
We're meeting her at the coffee shop!

1109
01:36:32,388 --> 01:36:37,655
Where were you? I already met her.

1110
01:36:38,761 --> 01:36:39,625
But she's gone.

1111
01:36:40,863 --> 01:36:41,454
Why?

1112
01:36:41,964 --> 01:36:45,593
I went out to cry and
she just disappeared.

1113
01:36:47,603 --> 01:36:50,128
That public official girl was with me.

1114
01:36:51,774 --> 01:36:52,502
What girl?

1115
01:36:54,076 --> 01:36:55,566
That girl you talked about.

1116
01:36:55,644 --> 01:36:57,339
She's wearing your shoes.

1117
01:36:58,848 --> 01:37:01,339
We have to find Moon-Young first!

1118
01:37:04,286 --> 01:37:06,254
Could you check to see if...

1119
01:37:06,322 --> 01:37:09,257
Please believe me. We do not lie to our clients.

1120
01:37:09,325 --> 01:37:13,853
She was here just 5 minutes ago!

1121
01:37:13,929 --> 01:37:16,659
Are you calling me a liar?

1122
01:37:17,333 --> 01:37:19,130
I'm sorry. Mom, stay over there.

1123
01:37:19,502 --> 01:37:20,628
Go where?

1124
01:37:21,237 --> 01:37:22,261
Would you just go!

1125
01:37:22,838 --> 01:37:23,827
Why, you lousy...

1126
01:37:26,108 --> 01:37:29,407
Her name is Victoria.
She's a lawyer from the U.S.

1127
01:37:30,513 --> 01:37:33,209
I was out playing golf, you see.
Please check again.

1128
01:37:52,735 --> 01:37:53,565
She checked out.

1129
01:37:58,874 --> 01:37:59,841
What is it? Get up.

1130
01:38:01,277 --> 01:38:02,244
This isn't our house!

1131
01:38:02,778 --> 01:38:06,646
You want me to get you a blanket?

1132
01:38:13,155 --> 01:38:15,555
You can't go! Don't go!

1133
01:38:15,958 --> 01:38:18,654
Don't go, don't go. Never! Never! Never!

1134
01:38:19,562 --> 01:38:20,620
Over my dead body!

1135
01:38:22,531 --> 01:38:23,361
Over my dead body!

1136
01:38:24,099 --> 01:38:26,624
Victoria, get out. You out car!

1137
01:38:31,240 --> 01:38:34,073
Victoria! Please forgive me.
I'm a liar! Mother said...

1138
01:38:34,577 --> 01:38:38,946
Mother... Mother like you... Moon-su want you.

1139
01:38:39,014 --> 01:38:42,506
What are you talking about?
Please calm down and let me go.

1140
01:38:44,353 --> 01:38:47,447
They are waiting for you.

1141
01:38:48,457 --> 01:38:50,982
We have to leave now.
There'll be a lot of traffic.

1142
01:38:52,461 --> 01:38:53,928
Please don't go, Victoria!

1143
01:38:54,997 --> 01:38:56,191
Please.

1144
01:39:10,546 --> 01:39:11,877
Don't just sit anywhere.

1145
01:39:25,327 --> 01:39:31,493
Victoria, I'm your brother.
Call me brother Moon-Su.

1146
01:39:34,937 --> 01:39:43,504
You know? Mother everyday
see your picture.

1147
01:39:43,579 --> 01:39:49,814
Really. She's always looking at it.

1148
01:39:50,386 --> 01:39:51,717
I've seen her with it all my life.

1149
01:39:54,623 --> 01:39:55,851
Mother...

1150
01:39:55,924 --> 01:39:57,391
My baby!

1151
01:40:07,836 --> 01:40:09,133
Brother!

1152
01:40:18,280 --> 01:40:23,377
A lady asked me to give you these shoes.

1153
01:40:25,054 --> 01:40:26,248
My shoes.

1154
01:40:27,489 --> 01:40:29,150
Where's that girl?

1155
01:40:54,450 --> 01:40:57,317
My one-sided love is over.

1156
01:40:59,088 --> 01:41:02,649
Nothing ever happens in my life.

1157
01:41:04,760 --> 01:41:06,193
That's normal.

1158
01:41:09,131 --> 01:41:10,792
Because I really AM normal.

1159
01:42:33,982 --> 01:42:34,414
Young-Ju!

1160
01:42:35,684 --> 01:42:36,343
Young-Ju!

1161
01:42:36,885 --> 01:42:37,408
Candy?

1162
01:42:56,839 --> 01:42:57,362
Candy?

1163
01:42:58,507 --> 01:42:59,269
Young-Ju!

1164
01:43:00,008 --> 01:43:00,770
Young-Ju Na!

1165
01:43:02,911 --> 01:43:04,071
Candy?

1166
01:43:06,482 --> 01:43:08,814
Young-Ju! Candy!

1167
01:43:10,052 --> 01:43:10,711
Candy?

1168
01:43:11,587 --> 01:43:12,645
It's me, Elvis!

1169
01:43:14,189 --> 01:43:17,522
Candy! Young-Ju!

1170
01:43:19,394 --> 01:43:25,299
Candy, it's me, Moon-Su.

1171
01:43:27,569 --> 01:43:28,661
Candy!

1172
01:43:30,072 --> 01:43:34,236
Young-Ju! Candy!

1173
01:43:36,478 --> 01:43:37,502
Young-Ju!

1174
01:43:53,428 --> 01:43:54,258
Candy!

1175
01:43:56,532 --> 01:43:57,521
I have something to tell you.

1176
01:43:59,535 --> 01:44:02,698
Victoria isn't my girlfriend.
She's my sister!

1177
01:44:04,339 --> 01:44:06,534
So stop hiding from me!

1178
01:44:09,111 --> 01:44:10,237
Candy!

1179
01:44:10,412 --> 01:44:11,936
Who's Candy?

1180
01:44:12,114 --> 01:44:17,074
I may be a player, but I wouldn't
date my own sister!

1181
01:44:18,587 --> 01:44:20,851
I have principles, you know!

1182
01:44:22,257 --> 01:44:24,452
You're weird to think that.

1183
01:44:30,132 --> 01:44:31,656
God, he's so loud.

1184
01:44:33,001 --> 01:44:38,496
So he's admitting he's a playboy?
Is he retarded or what?

1185
01:44:38,574 --> 01:44:41,134
It's because she's his sister.

1186
01:44:42,444 --> 01:44:43,706
We're getting off here, right?

1187
01:44:44,046 --> 01:44:45,206
Yeah.

1188
01:44:45,581 --> 01:44:49,347
Hold on. Then who's younger,
Victoria or the playboy?

1189
01:44:49,418 --> 01:44:50,146
You are!

1190
01:44:50,485 --> 01:44:51,076
Don't piss me off!

1191
01:44:51,153 --> 01:44:54,714
He said Victoria thought
her brother was a playboy.

1192
01:44:55,290 --> 01:44:56,621
You're sure?

1193
01:44:57,292 --> 01:44:58,020
Okay.

1194
01:45:00,862 --> 01:45:03,956
Victoria is his sister?

1195
01:45:04,666 --> 01:45:05,325
That's right.

1196
01:45:06,535 --> 01:45:07,399
Sure.

1197
01:45:09,638 --> 01:45:10,627
Young-Ju Na!

1198
01:45:11,573 --> 01:45:12,039
Here he is again.

1199
01:45:13,041 --> 01:45:15,805
Hey, then who's Candy?

1200
01:45:16,445 --> 01:45:16,968
You're Candy.

1201
01:45:17,045 --> 01:45:18,012
Come here, you jerk.

1202
01:45:18,647 --> 01:45:22,674
I'm Park Moon-Su and
I have to see you today!

1203
01:45:24,019 --> 01:45:26,010
Young-Ju!

1204
01:45:26,488 --> 01:45:27,819
Candy!

1205
01:45:27,889 --> 01:45:30,790
I just need it for a minute.

1206
01:45:30,859 --> 01:45:31,621
Young-Ju Na!

1207
01:45:31,693 --> 01:45:33,991
Why are you always taking my paper?

1208
01:45:34,363 --> 01:45:36,763
- Victoria is my sister...
- What did I ever do to you?

1209
01:45:41,470 --> 01:45:42,596
What is she doing?

1210
01:45:56,685 --> 01:45:57,481
Young-Ju?

1211
01:46:02,157 --> 01:46:03,146
Young-Ju.

1212
01:46:42,597 --> 01:46:47,398
I've never really dated anyone.

1213
01:46:49,671 --> 01:46:51,662
So, what I mean is...

1214
01:46:56,545 --> 01:46:59,105
You're so slow! You want to
go out with her, right?

1215
01:47:00,549 --> 01:47:01,607
Yes!

1216
01:47:02,551 --> 01:47:03,575
I do.

1217
01:47:06,154 --> 01:47:07,121
I love you!

1218
01:47:12,894 --> 01:47:14,259
I really love you.

1219
01:47:17,999 --> 01:47:23,665
No, you don't.

1220
01:47:24,573 --> 01:47:25,562
There is no way you could.

1221
01:47:27,042 --> 01:47:32,241
You said when you really loved
someone, you'd propose in English.

1222
01:47:33,448 --> 01:47:34,472
So it's not me.

1223
01:47:35,884 --> 01:47:38,546
Of course not. I'm so plain...

1224
01:47:40,155 --> 01:47:42,385
Someone like you wouldn't like me.

1225
01:47:42,758 --> 01:47:49,687
No, "love" sounds better in Korean.

1226
01:47:59,674 --> 01:48:06,842
Then does "kiss" sound better in English or Korean?

1227
01:48:14,322 --> 01:48:17,849
Well, there are a lot of people here...
So what I'm saying is...

1228
01:48:54,996 --> 01:48:56,429
What a cute little baby!

1229
01:48:57,165 --> 01:48:59,030
Is it a boy or girl?

1230
01:48:59,467 --> 01:49:00,525
Our little princess.

1231
01:49:00,936 --> 01:49:02,096
She looks just like you.

1232
01:49:03,038 --> 01:49:03,970
Yeah, you think?

1233
01:49:04,706 --> 01:49:06,970
Look at her! She looks just like me!

1234
01:49:07,709 --> 01:49:08,607
Absolutely!

1235
01:49:09,211 --> 01:49:12,408
Enjoy your day. Bye, bye. Have a nice day!

1236
01:49:19,054 --> 01:49:19,952
Mommy!

1237
01:49:21,489 --> 01:49:23,616
Our baby spoke for the first time.

1238
01:49:24,693 --> 01:49:26,285
She'll learn to speak.

1239
01:49:27,429 --> 01:49:31,331
She'll learn English too someday
and it will be hard.

1240
01:49:32,434 --> 01:49:41,832
Then I'll tell him to speak up boldly
for someone will answer him.

1241
01:49:45,447 --> 01:49:48,848
She wet herself again!

1242
01:49:49,317 --> 01:49:52,286
Honey, get me a diaper.

1243
01:49:53,321 --> 01:49:55,755
I left them in the car.

1244
01:49:57,292 --> 01:49:58,520
Why did you do that?

1245
01:50:04,966 --> 01:50:05,955
You expect me to go?

1246
01:50:08,236 --> 01:50:09,134
No, I'll go.

1247
01:50:27,455 --> 01:50:35,419
I came to my hometown. I'm very happy.
Because I have a beautiful wife.

1248
01:50:36,698 --> 01:50:40,293
But I have a problem.
She keeps speaking Korean, not English.

1249
01:50:40,802 --> 01:50:48,709
She sells seashells on the seashore.
Korean is so beautiful.

1250
01:50:49,344 --> 01:50:50,242
Beautiful!

1251
01:50:52,881 --> 01:51:02,449
Now, I drive a cab.
I often go Incheon airport, because I can talk to foreigners.

1252
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:10,956
Oh, I also have something to confess.
This is my wife...

1253
01:51:11,700 --> 01:51:13,895
We didn't mean to hide it.

1254
01:51:13,969 --> 01:51:17,200
I'm taking our Yoo-Jeong to Canada.

1255
01:51:17,272 --> 01:51:20,571
We'll be staying there for about two years.

1256
01:51:21,810 --> 01:51:24,779
I'll be a long distance father for a while.

1257
01:51:25,814 --> 01:51:29,306
If you cheat on me, I'll kill you.

1258
01:51:31,086 --> 01:51:33,054
I'm going abroad to study.

1259
01:51:33,121 --> 01:51:35,885
America? No. I'm going to China.

1260
01:51:35,957 --> 01:51:38,926
I think I could master
Chinese in short time.

1261
01:51:38,994 --> 01:51:42,225
Call me if you come to Beijing.
See you!

1262
01:51:46,868 --> 01:51:47,960
Scene 49, cut 3, take 2

1263
01:51:56,778 --> 01:52:00,612
Their faces are this small
and have almond-shaped eyes!

1264
01:52:00,682 --> 01:52:02,809
Doesn't everyone say that?

1265
01:52:05,820 --> 01:52:09,722
You'd want any of them to be your daughter-in-law.

1266
01:52:11,126 --> 01:52:12,525
There are plenty of...

1267
01:52:21,870 --> 01:52:24,737
I'm an... wait...

1268
01:52:26,274 --> 01:52:29,402
Sorry. - That's all right.

1269
01:52:30,678 --> 01:52:33,738
How come you...

1270
01:52:34,115 --> 01:52:38,779
I have no choice. Just do it!

1271
01:52:39,120 --> 01:52:42,214
Those kind of thoughts came to me!

1272
01:52:42,757 --> 01:52:43,655
Cut!

1273
01:52:47,962 --> 01:52:49,224
God! Scary!

1274
01:52:52,200 --> 01:52:53,462
How did you do that? How?

1275
01:52:53,535 --> 01:52:55,196
I don't know.
