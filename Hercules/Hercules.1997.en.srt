1
00:00:18,392 --> 00:00:21,938
Long ago, in the far away land
of ancient Greece...

2
00:00:22,104 --> 00:00:24,815
there was a golden age
of powerful gods...

3
00:00:24,982 --> 00:00:27,652
and extraordinay heroes.

4
00:00:27,818 --> 00:00:30,780
And the greatest and strongest
of all these heroes...

5
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:33,658
was the mighty Hercules.

6
00:00:33,824 --> 00:00:36,494
But what is the measure
of a true hero?

7
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:38,746
Ah, that is what our stoy is...

8
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:40,248
Will you listen to him?

9
00:00:40,414 --> 00:00:43,292
He's makin' the story
sound like some Greek tragedy.

10
00:00:43,459 --> 00:00:44,877
Lighten up, dude.

11
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:47,004
We'll take it from here, darling.

12
00:00:47,171 --> 00:00:49,006
You go, girl.

13
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:52,552
We are the muses...

14
00:00:52,718 --> 00:00:56,305
goddesses of the arts
and proclaimers of heroes.

15
00:00:56,472 --> 00:00:58,140
Heroes like Hercules.

16
00:00:58,307 --> 00:01:00,184
Honey, you mean "Hunk-ules".

17
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:02,562
Ooh, I'd like to make
some sweet music with him...

18
00:01:02,728 --> 00:01:05,398
Our story actually begins...

19
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,608
long before Hercules...

20
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:09,819
many eons ago.

21
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:11,487
Ah

22
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:14,532
Back when the world was new

23
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:17,368
- Whoa!
- The planet Earth was down on its luck

24
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:23,791
And everywhere gigantic brutes
called Titans ran amok

25
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:26,794
It was a nasty place

26
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:29,547
There was a mess
wherever you stepped

27
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:34,343
Where chaos reigned and earthquakes
and volcanoes never slept

28
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:35,970
Whoo! Say it, girlfriend!

29
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:37,555
And then along came Zeus

30
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:40,516
- He hurled his thunderbolt
- He zapped

31
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:44,061
- Locked those suckers in a vault
- They're trapped

32
00:01:44,228 --> 00:01:47,940
And on his own
stopped chaos in its tracks

33
00:01:48,107 --> 00:01:49,567
And that's the gospel truth

34
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:54,155
The guy was too "TypeA"
to just relax

35
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:57,158
- And that's the world's first dish
- Yeah, baby.

36
00:01:57,325 --> 00:02:00,286
Zeus tamed the globe
while still in his youth

37
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:03,122
Though, honey
it may seem impossible

38
00:02:03,247 --> 00:02:06,417
That's the gospel truth

39
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:08,836
On Mount Olympus life was neat

40
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:11,214
And smooth as sweet vermouth

41
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:15,301
Although, honey
it may seem impossible

42
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:21,807
That's the gospel truth

43
00:02:21,974 --> 00:02:25,770
- Ah, ah
- Ah

44
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:29,941
- Ah, ah
- Oh, yeah, yeah

45
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:33,986
- Ah, ah
- Hey, hey, hey

46
00:02:34,153 --> 00:02:38,157
- Ah, ah
- Hey, yeah

47
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:03,266
Hercules!

48
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:06,477
Behave yourself.

49
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:12,191
Oh, look at this.

50
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,818
Look how cute he is.

51
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:21,450
Hah! Oh, he's strong...

52
00:03:21,617 --> 00:03:23,494
like his dad, hmm?

53
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:25,496
Whoa! Excuse me!
Hot stuff coming through!

54
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:27,748
Excuse me.
One side, Ares.

55
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:31,419
Why, Hermes, they're lovely.

56
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,838
Yeah, you know, I had Orpheus
do the arrangement.

57
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:36,340
Isn't that too nutty?

58
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:39,302
Fabulous party. You know, I haven't
seen this much love in a room...

59
00:03:39,468 --> 00:03:41,846
since Narcissus discovered himself.

60
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,809
Dear, keep those
away from the baby.

61
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:49,061
Oh, he won't hurt himself.

62
00:03:49,228 --> 00:03:51,606
Let the kid have a little fun.

63
00:04:00,781 --> 00:04:03,826
On behalf of my son,
I want to thank you all...

64
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:06,871
for your wonderful gifts!

65
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,664
What about our gift, dear?

66
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:11,876
Well, let's see here.
We'll take... Hmm, yes.

67
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:16,547
A little cirrus and, uh, hmm,
a touch of nimbostratus...

68
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:20,134
and a dash of cumulus.

69
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:27,266
His name is Pegasus...

70
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:30,311
and he's all yours, son.

71
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:43,741
Mind his head.

72
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:45,701
He's so tiny.

73
00:04:51,123 --> 00:04:52,959
My boy.

74
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:55,837
My little Hercules.

75
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:58,422
How sentimental.

76
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:02,176
You know, I haven't been
this choked up...

77
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:05,096
since I got a hunk of moussaka
caught in my throat!

78
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,557
Huh?

79
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,559
So is this an audience
or a mosaic?

80
00:05:09,725 --> 00:05:12,061
Hey, how you doin'?
Lookin' good. Nice dress.

81
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:14,730
So, Hades,
you finally made it.

82
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:16,607
How are things
in the underworld?

83
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:19,527
Well, they're just fine. You know,
a little dark, a little gloomy.

84
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,863
And, as always,
hey, full of dead people.

85
00:05:22,029 --> 00:05:25,116
What are you gonna do? Ah!
There's the little sunspot.

86
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:29,203
Little snootchie. And here is a sucker
for the little sucker.

87
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,038
Eh? Here you go.
You just...

88
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,251
Sheesh!

89
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,545
Uh, powerful little tyke.

90
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:41,090
Come on, Hades. Don't be such a stiff.
Join the celebration!

91
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:43,634
Hey. Love to, babe...

92
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:46,554
but unlike you gods
lounging about up here...

93
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:49,056
I regrettably
have a full-time gig...

94
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:52,685
that you, by the way,
so charitably bestowed on me, Zeus.

95
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:56,147
So, can't.
Love to, but can't.

96
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:59,984
You ought to slow down.
You'll work yourself to death.

97
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:02,987
Hah! Work yourself to death!

98
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,824
Oh, I kill myself!

99
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:10,578
If only. If only.

100
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:15,041
If there's one god you don't want
to get steamed up, it's Hades.

101
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,752
'Cause he had an evil plan.

102
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:22,381
He ran the underworld

103
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:26,302
But thought the dead
were dull and uncouth

104
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:29,764
He was as mean
as he was ruthless

105
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:33,809
And that's the gospel truth

106
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:38,606
He had a plan
to shake things up

107
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:48,115
And that's the gospel truth

108
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,581
Pain!

109
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,668
Coming,
your most lugubriousness. Ow!

110
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:05,633
- Panic!
- Oh, I'm sory. I can handle it!

111
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:16,018
- Pain! Oh!
- And Panic!

112
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:18,187
Reporting for duty!

113
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:21,649
Fine, fine, fine. Just let me know
the instant the Fates arrive.

114
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,526
Oh. They're here.

115
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:27,029
What? The Fates are here,
and you didn't tell me?

116
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:33,202
We are worms!
Worthless worms!

117
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:36,873
Memo to me, memo to me:
maim you after my meeting.

118
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:45,256
Darling, hold that mortal's
thread of life...

119
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,758
good and tight.

120
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:53,890
Incoming!

121
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,276
Ladies.
I am so sorry that I'm...

122
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,445
- Late!
- We knew you would be.

123
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,697
We know eveything.

124
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,949
- Past.
- Present.

125
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,993
And future.

126
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,038
Indoor plumbing.
It's gonna be big.

127
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,707
Great, gr... Anyway, see, ladies, I
was at this party and I lost track of...

128
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:23,669
- We know!
- Yeah. I know you know.

129
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,839
So here's the deal. Zeus...

130
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:30,885
Mr High and Mighty, Mr "Hey, You,
Get Off Of My Cloud",... now he has...

131
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:34,222
- A bouncing baby brat.
- We know!

132
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:37,099
I know you know!
I know. I got it.

133
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:39,602
I got the concept.
So let me just ask:

134
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,813
is this kid gonna mess up
my hostile takeover bid, or what?

135
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,441
- What do you think?
- Oh, no you don't.

136
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:48,903
We're not supposed
to reveal the future.

137
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,614
Oh, wait. I'm sorry.
Time out. Can I...

138
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,491
Can I ask you a question by the way?
Are you...

139
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,952
Did you cut your hair or something?
You look fabulous.

140
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:58,454
I mean, you look like a Fate
worse than death.

141
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:02,208
Oh, gross!

142
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,418
Yech! It's blinkin'!

143
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:10,216
Ladies, please.
My fate...

144
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,468
is in your lovely hands.

145
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:15,304
- Oh.
- Oh, all right.

146
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:22,603
In 18 years precisely...

147
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,231
the planets will align...

148
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,526
ever so nicely.

149
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:29,777
Ay, verse. Oy.

150
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,488
The time to act
will be at hand.

151
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:36,868
Unleash the Titans,
your monstrous band.

152
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,369
Mm-hmm. Good, good.

153
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:43,791
Then the once-proud Zeus
will finally fall...

154
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,919
and you, Hades...

155
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:50,089
will rule all!

156
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,800
Yes! Hades rules!

157
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:57,138
- A word of caution to this tale.
- Excuse me?

158
00:09:57,305 --> 00:10:01,934
Should Hercules fight,
you will fail.

159
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,941
What?

160
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,819
Okay, fine, fine.
I'm cool. I'm fine.

161
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:17,074
Pain? Panic?
Got a little riddle for ya.

162
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:20,369
How do you kill a god?

163
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:22,121
I do not know!

164
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,915
You can't. They're immortal?

165
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,750
Bingo! They're immortal!

166
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:30,546
So, first you got to turn
the little sunspot...

167
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,548
mortal.

168
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:03,788
- Huh?
- Wha... What is it?

169
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,748
The baby!

170
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:15,383
Hercules! Oh!

171
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:23,432
No!

172
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,017
Now we did it!

173
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,270
Zeus is gonna use us
for target practice!

174
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,564
Just hang on to the kid, Panic!

175
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:36,612
Hurry! Let's just kill the kid
and get it over with, okay?

176
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,907
Here you go, kid.
A little Grecian formula.

177
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:45,371
Look at that! He's changing.
Can we do it now?

178
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,666
No, no, no. He has to drink
the whole potion.

179
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,919
- Evey last drop!
- Who's there?

180
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,760
Alcmene, over here.

181
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:03,848
Oh, you poor thing.

182
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:05,892
- Oh, don't cy.
- Is anybody there?

183
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,269
- Now?
- Now.

184
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,732
Oh. Well, he must
have been abandoned.

185
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,401
Amphityon, for so many years...

186
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,821
we've prayed to the gods
to bless us with a child.

187
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,240
Perhaps they've answered
our prayers.

188
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,909
Perhaps they have.

189
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,952
"Hercules"?

190
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,724
Help, help, help!

191
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,143
Hades is gonna kill us
when he finds out what happened.

192
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,896
You mean, if he finds out.

193
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:54,440
Of course he's gonna f...

194
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,485
If. If is good.

195
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:03,241
It was tragic. Zeus led all the gods
on a frantic search.

196
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:07,286
But by the time they found the baby,
it was too late.

197
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:12,083
- Young Herc was mortal now
- Mmm

198
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,795
But since he did not drink
the last drop

199
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:19,048
He still retained
his godlike strength

200
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:23,761
- So thank his lucky stars
- Tell it, girl.

201
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:28,766
- But Zeus and Hera wept
- Ooh, ooh, ooh

202
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:32,562
Because their son
could never come home

203
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:35,314
They'd have to watch
their precious baby

204
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:39,443
Grow up from a far

205
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:44,532
Though Hades' horrid plan

206
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:47,910
Was hatched before Herc
cut his first tooth

207
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:52,248
- Ahh
- The boy grew stronger everyday

208
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:56,544
And that's the gospel truth

209
00:13:56,711 --> 00:14:04,552
The gospel truth

210
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:16,272
Hercules, slow down!

211
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,278
Look out!

212
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,113
Oops! S-S-sorry, guys!

213
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,449
- Hey, watch where you're goin'!
- Sunday driver!

214
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,622
Thanks, son.

215
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:36,417
When old Penelope twisted her ankle
back there, I thought we were done for.

216
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:39,795
- No problem, Pop.
- Uh, don't-don't-don't unload just yet.

217
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,839
First, I have to finagle
with Phideas.

218
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,341
Okay.

219
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,552
Oops. sorry, Penelope.

220
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,972
Now, Hercules, this time,
please just...

221
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,266
I know, I know.

222
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,810
Stay by the cart.

223
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,812
That's my boy.

224
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,485
Oh, my goodness. Whoa!

225
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:04,320
Careful!

226
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:07,865
- Why, thank you.
- No problem.

227
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:11,327
Why, Hercules! I-I-It's you!

228
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:15,122
- Let me, let me help you with that.
- No, no, no, no, no. I got it!

229
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,250
I'm fine.
You just run along.

230
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,085
- Are you sure?
- Oh, yes.

231
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,128
Absolutely.

232
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:27,176
Yo! Give it here!

233
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,220
Hey, you need an extra guy?

234
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,640
Uh, sorry, Herc.

235
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:35,351
Uh, we already got five...

236
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,270
and we want to keep it
an even number.

237
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,772
- Hey, wait a second. Five isn't an ev...
- See ya, Herc.

238
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,608
- What a geek!
- Destructo Boy.

239
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:45,319
- Maybe we should call him "Jerkules".
- Yeah!

240
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,744
Heads up!

241
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,830
- I-I got it!
- No! Stop!

242
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:02,170
Uh-oh. Oh, no.

243
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,006
It's okay.

244
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,015
Hey! Whoa!

245
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:22,815
- Son!
- Hang on, Pop! Be right back!

246
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,818
Oh, my! Oh, no! Don't!
Oh, no, no, no, no!

247
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,446
No, no, no, no, no, no!

248
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,620
Watch out!

249
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:54,305
Nice catch, Jerkules.

250
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:57,225
Son.

251
00:16:57,391 --> 00:17:02,355
This is the last straw,
Amphityon!

252
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,023
That boy is a menace!

253
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:07,068
He's too dangerous
to be around normal people!

254
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:10,905
He didn't mean any harm.
He's just a kid.

255
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:15,034
He-He just can't control
his strength.

256
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:19,497
I'm warning you.
You keep that-that-that...

257
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:21,249
freak away from here!

258
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,626
Freak! Yeah, go away!

259
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:41,227
Son, you shouldn't let those things
they said back there get to ya.

260
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,980
But, Pop, they're right.
I-I am a freak.

261
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:47,358
I-I try to fit in.
I really do.

262
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:49,110
I just can't.

263
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:53,948
Sometimes I feel like...

264
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:56,826
like I really
don't belong here...

265
00:17:56,993 --> 00:18:01,789
like I'm supposed to be
someplace else.

266
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:04,000
Hercules, son...

267
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,002
I know it doesn't make any sense.

268
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:19,599
I have often dreamed

269
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:21,934
Of a far-offplace

270
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:27,607
Where a great, warm welcome
will be waiting for me

271
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,942
Where the crowds will cheer

272
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,778
When they see my face

273
00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:38,492
And a voice keeps sayin'
this is where I'm meant to be

274
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:42,288
I will find my way

275
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,457
I can go the distance

276
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:47,585
I'll be there someday

277
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:50,004
If I can be strong

278
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:52,590
I know every mile

279
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:55,468
Will be worth my while

280
00:18:56,802 --> 00:19:03,601
I would go most anywhere
to feel like I

281
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:07,897
Belong

282
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:14,278
Hercules, there's something
your mother and I...

283
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:18,157
have been meaning to, to tell ya.

284
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:22,328
But if you found me,
then where did I come from?

285
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,914
Why was I left here?

286
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:29,627
This was around your neck
when we found you.

287
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:33,881
It's the symbol of the gods.

288
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:37,593
This is it! Don't you see?
Maybe they have the answers.

289
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,887
I'll go to the temple of Zeus and...

290
00:19:42,557 --> 00:19:45,893
Ma, Pop...

291
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:50,565
you're the greatest parents
anyone could have, but...

292
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,567
I-I gotta know.

293
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:13,963
I am on my way

294
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,132
I can go the distance

295
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:18,885
I don't care how far

296
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,304
Somehow, I'll be strong

297
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,723
I know every mile

298
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:27,435
Will be worth my while

299
00:20:27,602 --> 00:20:30,521
I would go most anywhere

300
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:36,527
To find where I belong

301
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,715
Oh, mighty Zeus...

302
00:20:57,882 --> 00:21:02,094
please, hear me
and, and answer my prayer.

303
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,348
I need to know:
Who am I?

304
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:07,975
Wh-Where do I belong?

305
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:15,942
Huh?

306
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:25,701
My boy.
My little Hercules.

307
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:30,790
Hey, hey, hey.
Hold on, kiddo!

308
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:33,167
What's your hurry?
After all these years...

309
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:36,796
is this the kind of hello
you give your father?

310
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:38,548
F-F-Father?

311
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:41,676
Didn't know you had
a famous father, did you?

312
00:21:41,843 --> 00:21:43,678
Surprise!

313
00:21:44,846 --> 00:21:46,848
Look how you've grown.

314
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:49,684
Why, you've got your mother's
beautiful eyes...

315
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:51,936
and my strong chin.

316
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:54,939
- Hah!
- I-I don't understand.

317
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:58,985
If you're my father,
that would make me a...

318
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,528
A god.

319
00:22:00,695 --> 00:22:03,197
A god. A god!

320
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:05,825
Hey, you wanted answers,
and by thunder...

321
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:08,578
you're old enough now
to know the truth.

322
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:12,331
But why did you leave me on Earth?
Didn't you want me?

323
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:17,086
Of course we did. Your mother and I
loved you with all our hearts.

324
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:20,798
But someone stole you from us
and turned you mortal...

325
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:24,218
and only gods
can live on Mount Olympus.

326
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:25,845
And you can't do a thing?

327
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:27,972
I can't, Hercules,
but you can.

328
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:31,142
R-Really? W-What?
I'll do anything.

329
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:34,520
Hercules, if you can prove yourself
a true hero on Earth...

330
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:36,647
your godhood
will be restored.

331
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:39,650
A true hero. Great!

332
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:43,237
Uh, exactly how do you become
a true hero?

333
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:47,783
First, you must seek out Philoctetes,
the trainer of heroes.

334
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:50,745
Seek out Philoctetes.
Right. I'll...

335
00:22:50,912 --> 00:22:52,997
- Whoa!
- Whoa! Hold your horses!

336
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:54,999
Which reminds me.

337
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:04,342
Ha-ha! You probably
don't remember Pegasus...

338
00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:07,094
but you two go way back, son.

339
00:23:14,936 --> 00:23:16,896
Oh, Pegasus!

340
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:18,981
He's a magnificent horse...

341
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:21,567
with the brain of a bird.

342
00:23:24,195 --> 00:23:27,114
I'll find Philoctetes,
become a true hero!

343
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:28,533
That's the spirit!

344
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:32,995
I won't let you down, Father!
Yee-hah!

345
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:35,206
Good luck, son.

346
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,503
I will beat the odds

347
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:42,505
I can go the distance

348
00:23:42,672 --> 00:23:44,924
I will face the world

349
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:47,051
Fearless, proud and strong

350
00:23:47,218 --> 00:23:49,470
I will please the gods

351
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:51,472
I can go the distance

352
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:54,100
Till I find my hero's welcome

353
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:57,395
Right where I

354
00:23:57,562 --> 00:24:10,199
Belong

355
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:34,265
Whoa!

356
00:24:36,434 --> 00:24:38,769
- You sure
this is the right place?

357
00:24:50,031 --> 00:24:51,866
- What's the matter, little guy?
You stuck?

358
00:24:52,033 --> 00:24:56,204
- Whoa! Hey, butt out, buddy!
- Ugh!

359
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:58,873
Girls! Stop! Stop!
Come back! Come back, come back!

360
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,001
Whoa, whoa! Oh, jeez!

361
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:05,796
Wait! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Oh, nymphs!

362
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:08,633
- They can't keep their hands off me.
- Hey!

363
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:14,889
What's the matter?
You never seen a satyr before?

364
00:25:15,056 --> 00:25:17,725
Uh, no.
Can you help us?

365
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:22,563
We're looking for someone
called Philoctetes.

366
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,565
- Call me Phil.
- Phil!

367
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:27,068
- Ow!
- Boy, am I glad to meet you!

368
00:25:27,235 --> 00:25:30,363
I'm Hercules,
and this is Pegasus.

369
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:34,825
Animals. Disgusting.

370
00:25:34,951 --> 00:25:38,162
I need your help.
I want to become a hero, a true hero.

371
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:42,166
sorry, kid.
Can't help ya.

372
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:44,043
- Wait.
- Whoo!

373
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:46,128
Uh, sorry. Why not?

374
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:49,757
Two words: I am retired.

375
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:52,718
Look, I gotta do this.

376
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:54,720
Haven't you ever had a dream...

377
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:57,473
something you wanted so bad
you'd do anything?

378
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:03,437
Kid, come inside.
I want to show you somethin'.

379
00:26:11,946 --> 00:26:14,907
Watch it! That was part
of the mast of the Argo.

380
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:16,701
- The Argo?
- Yeah.

381
00:26:16,868 --> 00:26:20,371
Who do you think taught Jason
how to sail? Cleopatra?

382
00:26:20,538 --> 00:26:22,957
I trained
all those would-be heroes.

383
00:26:23,124 --> 00:26:27,879
Odysseus, Perseus, Theseus.
A lot of "yeuseus".

384
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:30,548
And every single one
of those bums let me down...

385
00:26:30,715 --> 00:26:32,466
flatter than a discus.

386
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:35,553
None of'em
could go the distance.

387
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,514
And then there was Achilles.

388
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:40,516
Now there was a guy
who had it all...

389
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:42,518
the build, the foot speed.

390
00:26:42,685 --> 00:26:44,604
He could jab.
He could take a hit.

391
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,148
He could keep on comin'.

392
00:26:47,315 --> 00:26:49,859
But that furshlugginer
heel of his!

393
00:26:50,026 --> 00:26:54,822
He barely gets nicked there once
and kaboom! He's history.

394
00:26:57,074 --> 00:26:58,701
Yeah, I had a dream once.

395
00:26:58,868 --> 00:27:02,246
I dreamed I was gonna train
the greatest hero there ever was.

396
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:06,542
So great, the gods would hang
a picture of him in the stars...

397
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:08,211
all across the sky...

398
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:12,006
and people would say,
"That's Phil's boy".

399
00:27:12,173 --> 00:27:14,091
That's right.

400
00:27:14,258 --> 00:27:16,135
Eh, but dreams are for rookies.

401
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:18,179
A guy can only take
so much disappointment.

402
00:27:18,346 --> 00:27:20,389
But I'm different
than those other guys, Phil.

403
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:24,644
I can go the distance.
Come on. I'll show ya.

404
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,771
Jeez. You don't give up, do ya?

405
00:27:26,938 --> 00:27:29,190
Watch this.

406
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:34,529
Holy Hera.

407
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:38,032
You know, maybe if I...
No! Snap out of it!

408
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:40,243
I'm too old to get mixed up
in this stuff again.

409
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:42,078
But if I don't become
a true hero...

410
00:27:42,245 --> 00:27:45,248
I'll never be able
to rejoin my father Zeus.

411
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:48,417
Hold it.
Zeus is your father, right?

412
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,419
Uh-huh.

413
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:54,048
Zeus, the big guy.
He's your daddy.

414
00:27:54,215 --> 00:27:58,135
Mr. Lightning Bolts!
Read me a book, would ya, Da-Da?

415
00:27:58,302 --> 00:28:01,138
Zeus!
"Once upon a time..."

416
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:03,891
- It's the truth!
- Please!

417
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:08,604
So you wanna be a hero, kid

418
00:28:08,771 --> 00:28:11,732
Well, whoop-de-do

419
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:13,901
I have been
around the block before

420
00:28:14,068 --> 00:28:16,362
With blockheads just like you

421
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:18,739
Each and everyone
a disappointment

422
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:22,368
Pain for which
there ain't no ointment

423
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:25,997
So much for excuses
Though a kid of Zeus is

424
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:29,458
Askin 'me to jump
into the fray

425
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:32,336
My answer is two words

426
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:36,799
Okay.

427
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:38,301
You mean you'll do it?

428
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:40,428
- You win.
- You won't be sorry, Phil.

429
00:28:40,595 --> 00:28:42,847
- Oh, gods.
- So when do we start? Can we start now?

430
00:28:43,014 --> 00:28:44,849
Oy, vay.

431
00:28:46,017 --> 00:28:48,853
I'd given up hope
that someone would come

432
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,646
Along

433
00:28:50,813 --> 00:28:53,107
A fella who'd ring the bell
for once

434
00:28:53,274 --> 00:28:55,401
Not the gong

435
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:57,820
The kind who wins trophies

436
00:28:57,987 --> 00:29:00,281
Won't settle for low fees

437
00:29:00,448 --> 00:29:02,200
At least semipro fees

438
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:05,244
But, no
I get the greenhorn

439
00:29:05,411 --> 00:29:09,707
I've been out to pasture, pal
My ambition gone

440
00:29:09,874 --> 00:29:14,545
Content to spend lazy days
and to graze my lawn

441
00:29:14,712 --> 00:29:17,048
But you need an advisor

442
00:29:17,215 --> 00:29:19,467
A satyr, but wiser

443
00:29:19,634 --> 00:29:23,262
A good merchandiser
and... whoa

444
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:27,225
There goes my ulcer
I'm down to one last hope, and I hope

445
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:29,185
It's you

446
00:29:29,352 --> 00:29:33,981
Though, kid, you're not
exactly a dream come true

447
00:29:34,148 --> 00:29:36,275
It rained enough turkeys

448
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:38,736
- Who nevercame through
- Whoa!

449
00:29:38,903 --> 00:29:41,489
You're my one last hope
so you'll have to do

450
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:46,452
Rule number six:
when rescuing a damsel...

451
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:48,579
always handle with care.

452
00:29:50,498 --> 00:29:52,333
No!

453
00:29:53,668 --> 00:29:56,420
Rule number 95, kid: concentrate!

454
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:00,883
Rule number 96:

455
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:03,094
aim!

456
00:30:03,261 --> 00:30:05,388
Demigods have faced the odds

457
00:30:05,555 --> 00:30:07,765
And ended up a mockey

458
00:30:07,932 --> 00:30:09,475
Don't believe the stories

459
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:12,979
That you read
on all the crockey

460
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:17,483
To be a true hero, kid
is a dyin' art

461
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:20,194
Like paintin' a masterpiece

462
00:30:20,361 --> 00:30:22,321
It's a work of heart

463
00:30:22,488 --> 00:30:24,657
It takes more than sinew

464
00:30:24,824 --> 00:30:27,201
Comes down to what's in you

465
00:30:27,368 --> 00:30:30,997
You have to continue to grow

466
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:33,207
Now that's more like it!

467
00:30:33,374 --> 00:30:35,793
I'm down to one lastshot

468
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,630
And my last high note

469
00:30:39,797 --> 00:30:44,969
Before that blasted underworld
gets my goat

470
00:30:45,136 --> 00:30:46,888
My dreams are on you, kid

471
00:30:47,054 --> 00:30:49,140
Go make 'em come true

472
00:30:49,307 --> 00:30:51,058
Climb that uphill slope

473
00:30:51,225 --> 00:30:53,644
Keep pushin 'that envelope

474
00:30:53,811 --> 00:30:55,479
You're my one last hope

475
00:30:55,646 --> 00:30:58,900
And, kid, it's up to

476
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:02,904
You

477
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,614
Yeah!

478
00:31:07,158 --> 00:31:09,035
Did you see that?

479
00:31:09,202 --> 00:31:12,496
Next stop, Olympus.

480
00:31:12,663 --> 00:31:14,540
All right.
Just take it easy, champ.

481
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:16,709
I am ready.
I want to get off this island.

482
00:31:16,876 --> 00:31:19,337
I want to see battles
and monsters.

483
00:31:19,504 --> 00:31:21,339
Rescue some damsels.

484
00:31:21,506 --> 00:31:23,591
You know, heroic stuff.

485
00:31:23,758 --> 00:31:27,053
- Well.
- Aw, come on, Phil!

486
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:30,556
Well, okay, okay.
You want a road test? Saddle up, kid.

487
00:31:30,723 --> 00:31:34,185
- We're goin' to Thebes!
- Ya-hoo!

488
00:31:34,352 --> 00:31:36,938
- So what's in Thebes?
- A lot of problems.

489
00:31:37,104 --> 00:31:40,107
It's a big, tough town.
Good place to start buildin' a rep.

490
00:31:42,777 --> 00:31:44,320
Sounds like your basic DID...

491
00:31:44,487 --> 00:31:47,281
- Hyah!
- Damsel in distress!

492
00:31:53,955 --> 00:31:56,374
Not so fast, sweetheart.

493
00:31:56,541 --> 00:31:58,876
I swear, Nessus.
Put me down or I'll...

494
00:31:59,043 --> 00:32:02,755
Whoo!
I like 'em fiey!

495
00:32:02,922 --> 00:32:05,842
Now remember, kid.
First, analyse the situation.

496
00:32:06,008 --> 00:32:09,846
Don't just barrel in there
without thinking. Eh?

497
00:32:11,055 --> 00:32:12,640
He's losin' points for this!

498
00:32:12,807 --> 00:32:15,142
- You don't know what you're...
- Halt!

499
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:20,481
Step aside, two legs.

500
00:32:20,648 --> 00:32:24,235
Pardon me, my good, uh, uh, sir.

501
00:32:24,402 --> 00:32:26,237
I'll have to ask you to release
that young...

502
00:32:26,404 --> 00:32:29,156
- Keep movin', junior.
- Lady.

503
00:32:29,323 --> 00:32:32,869
But you... Are-Aren't you
a damsel in distress?

504
00:32:33,035 --> 00:32:36,080
I'm a damsel.
I'm in distress.

505
00:32:36,247 --> 00:32:39,166
I can handle this.
Have a nice day.

506
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:41,169
Uh...

507
00:32:41,335 --> 00:32:44,338
Ma'am, I'm afraid you may be too close
to the situation to realize...

508
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:49,552
Ohhh! What are you doin'?
Get your sword!

509
00:32:49,719 --> 00:32:54,348
Sword. Right, right. Rule number 15:
a hero is only as good as his weapon!

510
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:05,318
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold it! Hold on!
He's gotta do it on his own.

511
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:08,487
Come on, kid!
Concentrate!

512
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:10,198
Use your head!

513
00:33:11,532 --> 00:33:13,034
Oh.

514
00:33:17,788 --> 00:33:20,708
All right!
Not bad, kid!

515
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:23,377
Not exactly what I had in mind,
but not bad.

516
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:28,925
Oh, gee, miss.
I'm, I'm really sorry.

517
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:31,219
- Oh.
- That was dumb.

518
00:33:31,385 --> 00:33:32,720
Yeah.

519
00:33:33,888 --> 00:33:35,306
Excuse me.

520
00:33:40,895 --> 00:33:44,023
Nice work! Excelente.

521
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:46,234
Is Wonderboy here for real?

522
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,321
What are you talkin' about?
Of course he's real. Whoa!

523
00:33:51,489 --> 00:33:56,077
And by the way, sweet cheeks.
I'm real too.

524
00:33:56,244 --> 00:33:57,745
Ugh!

525
00:33:57,912 --> 00:34:00,998
Yee-hah! Ya-hoo!

526
00:34:07,171 --> 00:34:08,965
Whoa!

527
00:34:35,283 --> 00:34:37,201
- How was that, Phil?
- Reign it in, rookie.

528
00:34:37,368 --> 00:34:40,204
You can get away with mistakes
like those in the minor decathlons...

529
00:34:40,371 --> 00:34:42,957
but this is the big leagues!

530
00:34:43,124 --> 00:34:44,834
At least I beat him, didn't I?

531
00:34:45,001 --> 00:34:48,462
Next time, don't let your guard down
because of a pair of big goo-goo eyes!

532
00:34:48,629 --> 00:34:51,299
D-oh! It's like I keep tellin' ya.

533
00:34:51,424 --> 00:34:54,218
You gotta stay focused,
and you...

534
00:35:03,603 --> 00:35:06,772
Are you, uh, all right,
Miss, uh...

535
00:35:06,939 --> 00:35:08,858
Megara.
My friends call me Meg.

536
00:35:09,025 --> 00:35:10,860
At least they would
if I had any friends.

537
00:35:11,027 --> 00:35:15,489
So did they give you a name
along with all those rippling pectorals?

538
00:35:15,656 --> 00:35:19,535
Uh, uh, uh, I'm, um, uh...

539
00:35:19,702 --> 00:35:22,121
- Uh, uh...
- Are you always this articulate?

540
00:35:22,288 --> 00:35:25,208
Hercules. My...
My name is Hercules.

541
00:35:26,417 --> 00:35:29,587
Herc... Huh.
I think I prefer Wonderboy.

542
00:35:29,754 --> 00:35:33,883
So, uh, uh... How-how-how'd you
get mixed up with the, uh...

543
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:36,469
Pinhead with hooves?
Well, you know how men are.

544
00:35:36,636 --> 00:35:40,515
They think "No" means "Yes" and
"Get lost" means "Take me. I'm yours".

545
00:35:43,059 --> 00:35:46,437
Don't wory. Shorty here
can explain it to ya later.

546
00:35:46,604 --> 00:35:48,773
Well, thanks for everything, Herc.

547
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:51,734
It's been a real slice.

548
00:35:51,901 --> 00:35:54,987
Wait! Um, can we give you a ride?

549
00:35:58,241 --> 00:36:01,827
Uh, I don't think your pinto
likes me very much.

550
00:36:01,994 --> 00:36:04,664
Pegasus? Oh, no.
Don't be silly.

551
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:07,542
He'd be more than happy to... Ow!

552
00:36:09,335 --> 00:36:12,046
I'll be all right.
I'm a big tough girl.

553
00:36:12,213 --> 00:36:14,340
I tie my own sandals
and everything.

554
00:36:16,634 --> 00:36:18,052
Bye-bye, Wonderboy.

555
00:36:19,262 --> 00:36:21,722
Bye.

556
00:36:21,889 --> 00:36:25,017
She's somethin'.
Isn't she, Phil?

557
00:36:25,184 --> 00:36:27,895
Yeah, ye... Oh, yeah.
She's really somethin'.

558
00:36:28,062 --> 00:36:31,107
A real pain in the patella!
Earth to Herc!

559
00:36:31,274 --> 00:36:32,692
Come in, Herc!
Come in, Herc!

560
00:36:32,817 --> 00:36:35,403
We got a job to do, remember?

561
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:37,280
Thebes is still waitin'.

562
00:36:37,446 --> 00:36:39,824
Yeah. Yeah. I know.

563
00:36:51,294 --> 00:36:53,087
Aw, how cute.

564
00:36:53,254 --> 00:36:56,007
A couple of rodents
lookin' for a theme park.

565
00:36:56,174 --> 00:36:57,884
Who you callin' a rodent, sister?

566
00:36:58,009 --> 00:37:00,970
- I'm a bunny!
- A-And I'm his gopher!

567
00:37:01,137 --> 00:37:03,055
Ta-dah!

568
00:37:03,222 --> 00:37:05,474
I thought I smelled a rat.

569
00:37:05,641 --> 00:37:08,561
- Meg.
- Speak of the devil.

570
00:37:08,728 --> 00:37:12,773
Meg, my little flower, my little bird,
my little nut. Meg.

571
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,775
What exactly happened here?

572
00:37:14,942 --> 00:37:17,612
I thought you were gonna persuade
the river guardian to join my team...

573
00:37:17,778 --> 00:37:21,365
for the uprising, and here I am,
kind of river guardian-less.

574
00:37:21,532 --> 00:37:25,536
I gave it my best shot, but
he made me an offer I had to refuse.

575
00:37:25,703 --> 00:37:27,997
Fine. So instead of subtracting
two years from your sentence...

576
00:37:28,164 --> 00:37:30,124
hey, I'm gonna add two on, okay?

577
00:37:30,291 --> 00:37:32,376
- Give that your best shot.
- Look. It wasn't my fault.

578
00:37:32,543 --> 00:37:35,213
It was this wonderboy, Hercules.

579
00:37:35,379 --> 00:37:38,799
Hercules.
Why does that name ring a bell?

580
00:37:38,966 --> 00:37:41,802
I don't know.
Um, maybe we owe him money?

581
00:37:41,969 --> 00:37:46,516
- What was that name again?
- Hercules.

582
00:37:46,682 --> 00:37:48,559
He comes on with this big,
innocent farm boy routine...

583
00:37:48,726 --> 00:37:50,603
but I could see through that
in a Peloponnesian minute.

584
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:54,649
Wait a minute. Wasn't Hercules the name
of that kid we were supposed to...

585
00:37:54,815 --> 00:37:58,110
Oh, my gods!
Run for it!

586
00:37:58,277 --> 00:38:01,614
So you took care of him, huh?

587
00:38:01,781 --> 00:38:03,699
Dead as a doornail.

588
00:38:03,866 --> 00:38:06,702
Weren't those your exact words?

589
00:38:06,827 --> 00:38:08,579
This might be
a different Hercules.

590
00:38:08,746 --> 00:38:12,416
Yeah! I mean, Hercules
is a very popular name nowadays!

591
00:38:12,583 --> 00:38:15,920
Remember, like, a few years ago,
every other boy was named Jason...

592
00:38:16,045 --> 00:38:17,588
and the girls
were all named Brittany?

593
00:38:17,755 --> 00:38:22,343
I'm about to rearrange
the cosmos...

594
00:38:22,468 --> 00:38:25,805
and the one schlemiel
who can louse it up...

595
00:38:25,972 --> 00:38:29,267
is waltzing around in the woods!

596
00:38:33,688 --> 00:38:35,398
Wait. Wait, big guy.

597
00:38:35,565 --> 00:38:38,401
- We can still cut in on his waltzing.
- That's right.

598
00:38:38,568 --> 00:38:41,279
And-And at least we made him mortal.
That's a good thing.

599
00:38:41,404 --> 00:38:42,780
Didn't we?

600
00:38:42,947 --> 00:38:46,200
Hmm. Fortunately
for the three of you...

601
00:38:46,367 --> 00:38:50,204
we still have time to correct
this rather egregious oversight.

602
00:38:50,371 --> 00:38:54,000
And this time, no foul-ups.

603
00:38:56,836 --> 00:38:59,505
Wow!

604
00:38:59,672 --> 00:39:03,176
- Is that all one town?
- One town, a million troubles.

605
00:39:03,301 --> 00:39:05,052
The one and only Thebes.

606
00:39:05,219 --> 00:39:07,471
The Big Olive itself.

607
00:39:07,638 --> 00:39:10,474
If you can make it there,
you can make it anywhere.

608
00:39:17,899 --> 00:39:20,818
Stick with me, kid.
The city is a dangerous place.

609
00:39:22,612 --> 00:39:26,365
- Look where you're goin', numbskull!
- Hey, I'm walkin' here!

610
00:39:26,532 --> 00:39:28,826
See what I mean?
I'm tellin' you. Wackos.

611
00:39:28,993 --> 00:39:32,288
Pita bread. Pita bread.
Get your pita bread here.

612
00:39:32,455 --> 00:39:35,166
- Hey, Mack.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

613
00:39:35,291 --> 00:39:37,251
You wanna buy a sundial?

614
00:39:37,376 --> 00:39:39,420
He's not interested, all right?
Come on, kid.

615
00:39:39,587 --> 00:39:42,715
The end is coming!
Can't you feel it?

616
00:39:42,882 --> 00:39:45,593
Yes, yes.
Thank you for the info. Yes.

617
00:39:45,718 --> 00:39:48,095
We'll ponder that for awhile.
Just stare at the sidewalk.

618
00:39:48,262 --> 00:39:49,597
Come on.
Don't make eye contact.

619
00:39:49,722 --> 00:39:53,226
People here are nuts. That's because
they live in a city of turmoil.

620
00:39:53,351 --> 00:39:56,187
Trust me, kid. You're gonna be
just what the doctor ordered.

621
00:39:57,855 --> 00:40:02,276
It was tragic!
We lost everything in the fire.

622
00:40:02,401 --> 00:40:06,614
everything
except old Snowball here.

623
00:40:06,739 --> 00:40:09,450
Now were the fires
before or after the earthquake?

624
00:40:09,534 --> 00:40:11,410
They were after the earthquake.
I remember.

625
00:40:11,577 --> 00:40:13,037
But before the flood.

626
00:40:13,162 --> 00:40:16,374
Don't even get me started
on the crime rate.

627
00:40:16,541 --> 00:40:20,211
Thebes has certainly
gone downhill in a hurry.

628
00:40:20,378 --> 00:40:22,004
Tell me about it.

629
00:40:22,171 --> 00:40:24,131
It seems like every time
I turn around...

630
00:40:24,298 --> 00:40:26,342
there's some new monster
wreakin' havoc and I...

631
00:40:26,509 --> 00:40:29,637
All we need now
is a plague of locusts.

632
00:40:32,181 --> 00:40:35,017
That's it!
I'm movin' to Sparta!

633
00:40:35,184 --> 00:40:37,603
Excuse me.

634
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:39,438
It, uh...

635
00:40:39,605 --> 00:40:43,234
seems to me that
what you folks need is a hero.

636
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:46,487
Yeah, and who are you?

637
00:40:48,614 --> 00:40:50,783
I'm Hercules, and, uh...

638
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:53,202
I happen to be a hero.

639
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,581
- Is that so?
- A hero!

640
00:40:56,747 --> 00:40:59,000
Have you ever saved
a town before?

641
00:40:59,166 --> 00:41:01,419
Uh, no. Uh, not exactly, but I...

642
00:41:01,586 --> 00:41:04,005
Have you ever reversed
a natural disaster?

643
00:41:04,172 --> 00:41:06,424
Well, uh, no.

644
00:41:06,591 --> 00:41:10,428
Oh, listen to thi... He's just another
chariot chaser. This we need.

645
00:41:10,595 --> 00:41:11,929
That's a laugh.

646
00:41:12,096 --> 00:41:14,515
- Don't you pea brains get it?
- Hmm?

647
00:41:14,682 --> 00:41:16,642
This kid is the genuine article.

648
00:41:16,767 --> 00:41:21,022
Hey, isn't that the goat-man
who trained Achilles?

649
00:41:21,189 --> 00:41:22,732
Watch it, pal.

650
00:41:22,857 --> 00:41:27,361
Yeah, you're right.
Hey, uh, nice job on those heels!

651
00:41:27,528 --> 00:41:30,031
Ya missed a spot!

652
00:41:30,156 --> 00:41:32,283
You... I got your heel
right here!

653
00:41:32,408 --> 00:41:34,660
I'll wipe that stupid grin
off your face! You...

654
00:41:34,827 --> 00:41:37,705
Hey, Phil! Phil! Phil!

655
00:41:37,872 --> 00:41:40,625
What are you, crazy? Sheesh.

656
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:44,378
Young man, we need
a professional hero...

657
00:41:44,545 --> 00:41:46,964
not an amateur.

658
00:41:47,798 --> 00:41:49,842
Well, wait. Stop!

659
00:41:54,847 --> 00:41:56,974
How am I supposed
to prove myself a hero...

660
00:41:57,099 --> 00:41:58,809
if nobody
will give me a chance?

661
00:41:58,976 --> 00:42:00,311
You'll get your chance.

662
00:42:00,478 --> 00:42:04,273
You just need some kind
of catastrophe or disaster.

663
00:42:04,398 --> 00:42:08,027
Please. Help! Please!
There's been a terrible accident!

664
00:42:08,194 --> 00:42:10,530
- Meg?
- Speakin' of disasters.

665
00:42:10,655 --> 00:42:13,241
Wonderboy! Hercules!

666
00:42:13,407 --> 00:42:15,201
- Thank goodness.
- Wha-Wha-What's wrong?

667
00:42:15,368 --> 00:42:16,702
Oh! Outside of town.

668
00:42:16,869 --> 00:42:19,080
Two little boys.
Th-They were playing in the gorge.

669
00:42:19,247 --> 00:42:21,791
Th-There was this rock slide,
a terrible rock slide.

670
00:42:21,958 --> 00:42:24,669
- They're trapped!
- Kids? Trapped?

671
00:42:24,836 --> 00:42:26,379
Phil, this is great!

672
00:42:26,546 --> 00:42:28,381
You're really choked up
about this, aren't ya?

673
00:42:28,548 --> 00:42:30,675
- Come on!
- No, I... You don't under...

674
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,928
I, I have this terrible fear
of heights!

675
00:42:39,141 --> 00:42:41,853
I'm right behind ya, kid! Whoo!

676
00:42:41,936 --> 00:42:44,689
I'm way behind ya, kid.

677
00:42:44,856 --> 00:42:46,274
I got a fur wedgie.

678
00:42:53,197 --> 00:42:54,949
- Are you okay?
- I'll be fine.

679
00:42:55,116 --> 00:42:57,201
Just get me down
before I ruin the upholstey.

680
00:42:57,368 --> 00:42:59,245
Help! I can't breathe!

681
00:42:59,412 --> 00:43:01,330
- Hurry!
- Get us out!

682
00:43:01,497 --> 00:43:03,916
We're suffocating!

683
00:43:04,083 --> 00:43:07,211
Somebody call IX-I-I!

684
00:43:07,378 --> 00:43:09,005
Easy, fellas.
You'll be all right.

685
00:43:09,172 --> 00:43:10,756
We can't last much longer!

686
00:43:10,923 --> 00:43:13,426
Get us out before we get crushed!

687
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:34,572
- How you boys doin'?
- We're okay now.

688
00:43:34,739 --> 00:43:38,367
Jeepers, mister.
You're really strong.

689
00:43:38,534 --> 00:43:42,038
Well, just ty to be a little
more careful next time, okay, kids?

690
00:43:42,205 --> 00:43:45,082
We sure will.

691
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:51,130
Stirring performance, boys.

692
00:43:51,297 --> 00:43:53,216
I was really moved.

693
00:43:54,383 --> 00:43:56,761
"Jeepers, mister"?

694
00:43:56,928 --> 00:44:00,056
I was going for innocence.

695
00:44:00,223 --> 00:44:04,143
And, hey, two thumbs way,
way up for our leading lady.

696
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:06,354
What a dish.
What a doll.

697
00:44:06,521 --> 00:44:08,814
Get outta there, ya big lug,
while ya still can.

698
00:44:09,524 --> 00:44:11,609
Phil, I-I did great.

699
00:44:11,776 --> 00:44:13,611
They even applauded. Sort of.

700
00:44:15,196 --> 00:44:17,490
Huh! I hate
to burst your bubble, kid...

701
00:44:17,657 --> 00:44:19,534
but that ain't applause.

702
00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:29,794
Ph-Ph-Ph-Phil?
What do you call that thing?

703
00:44:29,961 --> 00:44:32,421
Two words:

704
00:44:32,588 --> 00:44:34,131
am-scray!

705
00:44:37,176 --> 00:44:40,721
Let's get ready to rumble!

706
00:44:47,937 --> 00:44:50,147
That's it. Dance around!
Dance around!

707
00:44:50,314 --> 00:44:53,651
Watch the teeth! Watch the teeth!
Keep going. Come on. Come on.

708
00:44:53,818 --> 00:44:56,737
Lead with your left.
Lead with your left. Your other left!

709
00:45:23,264 --> 00:45:25,474
Whoa!

710
00:45:51,125 --> 00:45:54,295
All right! All right!
You're bad! Okay!

711
00:45:54,462 --> 00:45:58,674
See, Phil?
That... That wasn't so hard.

712
00:45:58,841 --> 00:46:02,053
Kid, kid, kid.
How many horns do you see?

713
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:04,222
- Six?
- Eh, close enough.

714
00:46:04,388 --> 00:46:06,265
Let's get you cleaned up.

715
00:46:10,561 --> 00:46:15,316
Guys, guys, relax.
It's only halftime.

716
00:46:18,528 --> 00:46:20,321
That doesn't sound good.

717
00:46:28,162 --> 00:46:29,664
Definitely not good!

718
00:46:58,693 --> 00:47:01,696
Will you forget
the head-slicing thing?

719
00:47:09,370 --> 00:47:12,206
Phil, I don't think we covered this one
in basic training!

720
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:26,888
My favourite part of the game:

721
00:47:29,724 --> 00:47:31,392
sudden death.

722
00:47:52,663 --> 00:47:56,501
Oh. There goes another one.

723
00:47:56,667 --> 00:47:58,836
Just like Achilles.

724
00:48:01,005 --> 00:48:02,840
Game...

725
00:48:03,007 --> 00:48:06,636
set, match.

726
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,766
Hmm?

727
00:48:29,784 --> 00:48:32,620
Phil, you gotta admit.

728
00:48:32,787 --> 00:48:35,039
That was pretty heroic.

729
00:48:35,206 --> 00:48:39,502
Ya did it, kid! Ya did it!
Ya won by a landslide!

730
00:48:42,755 --> 00:48:44,632
Hades mad.

731
00:48:47,218 --> 00:48:49,637
Well, what do you know?

732
00:48:54,308 --> 00:48:57,812
From that day forward,
our boy Hercules could do no wrong.

733
00:48:57,979 --> 00:49:01,524
He was so hot,
steam looked cool.

734
00:49:01,691 --> 00:49:04,861
Oh, yeah

735
00:49:05,027 --> 00:49:07,572
Bless my soul
Herc was on a roll

736
00:49:07,738 --> 00:49:10,616
Person of the week
in every Greek opinion poll

737
00:49:10,783 --> 00:49:13,452
- What a pro
- Herc could stop a show

738
00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:16,455
Point him at a monster
and you're talkin 'SRO

739
00:49:16,622 --> 00:49:19,292
- He was a no one
- A zero, zero

740
00:49:19,458 --> 00:49:22,378
- Now he's a honcho
- He's a hero

741
00:49:22,545 --> 00:49:25,214
Here was a kid
with his act down pat

742
00:49:25,339 --> 00:49:28,134
Zero to hero in no time flat

743
00:49:28,301 --> 00:49:30,970
- Zero to hero
-Just like that

744
00:49:31,095 --> 00:49:33,931
When he smiled
the girls went wild

745
00:49:34,098 --> 00:49:36,559
With oohs and aahs

746
00:49:36,726 --> 00:49:39,520
And they slapped his face
on every vase

747
00:49:39,687 --> 00:49:42,481
On every "vahse"

748
00:49:42,648 --> 00:49:45,193
From appearance fees
and royalties

749
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:47,904
Our Herc had cash to burn

750
00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:50,781
Now nouveau riche and famous

751
00:49:50,948 --> 00:49:54,410
He could tell you
what's a Grecian urn

752
00:49:54,577 --> 00:49:57,288
Say amen
There he goes again

753
00:49:57,455 --> 00:50:00,124
- Sweet and undefeated
- And an awesome ten for ten

754
00:50:00,249 --> 00:50:02,710
Folks lined up
just to watch him flex

755
00:50:02,877 --> 00:50:06,088
And this perfect package
packed a pair of pretty pecs

756
00:50:06,255 --> 00:50:09,008
Hercie, he comes
He sees, he conquers

757
00:50:09,175 --> 00:50:11,928
Honey, the crowds
were goin 'bonkers

758
00:50:12,094 --> 00:50:14,514
- He showed the moxie brains and spunk
- Yeah

759
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:17,725
- From zero to hero
- A major hunk

760
00:50:17,892 --> 00:50:20,269
- Zero to hero
- And who'd have thunk

761
00:50:24,023 --> 00:50:25,900
Who put the glad in gladiator

762
00:50:26,067 --> 00:50:27,652
Hercules

763
00:50:27,818 --> 00:50:30,196
Whose darin 'deeds
are great theatre

764
00:50:30,363 --> 00:50:31,822
Hercules

765
00:50:31,989 --> 00:50:33,824
- Isn't he bold
- No one braver

766
00:50:33,991 --> 00:50:36,035
- Is he sweet
- Our favourite flavour

767
00:50:36,202 --> 00:50:38,037
- Hercules
- My man.

768
00:50:38,204 --> 00:50:39,997
- Hercules
- Hercules

769
00:50:40,164 --> 00:50:42,083
- Hercules
- Ooh

770
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:44,669
- Hercules
- Look at my Hercules

771
00:50:44,836 --> 00:50:47,964
- Hercules, Hercules
- Yeah, yeah, yeah

772
00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:50,341
Bless my soul
Herc was on a roll

773
00:50:50,508 --> 00:50:52,969
- Undefeated
- Riding high

774
00:50:53,135 --> 00:50:56,138
- And the nicest guy.
- Not conceited

775
00:50:56,305 --> 00:50:58,266
- He was a nothing
- A zero, zero

776
00:50:58,432 --> 00:51:00,226
- Now he's a honcho
- He's our hero

777
00:51:00,393 --> 00:51:03,354
He hit the heights
at breakneck speed

778
00:51:03,521 --> 00:51:05,731
From zero to hero

779
00:51:05,898 --> 00:51:07,733
Herc is a hero

780
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:12,989
Now he's a hero

781
00:51:13,155 --> 00:51:15,157
Yes, indeed

782
00:51:18,202 --> 00:51:20,162
Pull!

783
00:51:23,416 --> 00:51:25,251
Nice shootin', Rex.

784
00:51:25,418 --> 00:51:28,462
I can't believe this guy.
I throw everything I've got at him...

785
00:51:28,629 --> 00:51:31,048
and it doesn't even...

786
00:51:31,215 --> 00:51:34,927
What are those?

787
00:51:35,094 --> 00:51:38,931
Um, I don't know.
I-I thought they looked kinda dashing.

788
00:51:39,098 --> 00:51:42,768
I've got 24 hours
to get rid of this bozo...

789
00:51:42,935 --> 00:51:48,316
or the entire scheme I've been setting
up for 18 years goes up in smoke...

790
00:51:48,482 --> 00:51:53,654
and you are wearing
his merchandise?

791
00:52:01,412 --> 00:52:03,748
Thirsty?

792
00:52:13,633 --> 00:52:17,720
Looks like your game's over. Wonderboy
is hitting every curve you throw at him.

793
00:52:18,930 --> 00:52:20,765
Oh, yeah.

794
00:52:22,308 --> 00:52:25,269
I wonder if maybe
I haven't been throwing...

795
00:52:25,436 --> 00:52:30,816
the right curves at him,
Meg, my sweet.

796
00:52:30,983 --> 00:52:32,818
Don't even go there.

797
00:52:32,985 --> 00:52:35,112
See, he's gotta have
a weakness...

798
00:52:35,279 --> 00:52:37,406
because everybody's
got a weakness.

799
00:52:37,573 --> 00:52:39,909
I mean, for what?
Pandora, it was the box thing.

800
00:52:40,076 --> 00:52:42,745
For the Trojans, hey.
They bet on the wrong horse, okay?

801
00:52:42,870 --> 00:52:45,540
We simply need
to find out Wonderboy's.

802
00:52:45,706 --> 00:52:47,875
I've done my part.
Get your little imps...

803
00:52:48,042 --> 00:52:49,836
They couldn't handle him
as a baby.

804
00:52:50,002 --> 00:52:52,672
I need somebody
who can handle him as a man.

805
00:52:52,797 --> 00:52:54,507
Hey, I've sworn off manhandling.

806
00:52:54,674 --> 00:52:56,843
Well, you know, that's good
because that's what got you...

807
00:52:57,009 --> 00:52:58,845
into this jam in the first place,
isn't it?

808
00:52:59,011 --> 00:53:02,348
You sold your soul to me
to save your boyfriend's life.

809
00:53:02,515 --> 00:53:04,976
And how does this creep thank you?

810
00:53:05,142 --> 00:53:08,229
By running off
with some babe.

811
00:53:08,396 --> 00:53:10,231
He hurt you real bad,
didn't he, Meg? Huh?

812
00:53:10,398 --> 00:53:12,441
Look, I learned my lesson, okay?

813
00:53:12,608 --> 00:53:14,902
Which is exactly why
I got a feelin'...

814
00:53:15,069 --> 00:53:16,988
you're gonna leap
at my new offer.

815
00:53:17,154 --> 00:53:20,116
You give me the key
to bringing down Wonder Breath...

816
00:53:20,283 --> 00:53:23,828
and I give you the thing
that you crave most...

817
00:53:23,995 --> 00:53:26,789
in the entire cosmos:

818
00:53:26,956 --> 00:53:29,959
your freedom.

819
00:53:32,837 --> 00:53:34,630
You should
have been there, Father.

820
00:53:34,797 --> 00:53:36,757
I mangled the Minotaur...

821
00:53:36,924 --> 00:53:39,594
grappled with the Gorgon.

822
00:53:39,719 --> 00:53:42,180
Just like Phil told me.
I analysed the situation...

823
00:53:42,346 --> 00:53:44,724
controlled my strength
and kicked.

824
00:53:47,185 --> 00:53:49,020
The crowds went wild!

825
00:53:51,439 --> 00:53:54,317
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Hah!

826
00:53:54,483 --> 00:53:58,404
You're doing great, son.
You're doing your old man proud.

827
00:53:58,571 --> 00:54:00,573
I'm glad to hear you
say that, Father.

828
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:02,992
I've been waiting
for this day a long time.

829
00:54:03,159 --> 00:54:05,745
Hmm. What day is that, son?

830
00:54:05,912 --> 00:54:08,956
The day I rejoin the gods.

831
00:54:09,123 --> 00:54:12,543
You've done wonderfully.
You really have, my boy.

832
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:14,545
You're just not there yet.

833
00:54:14,712 --> 00:54:18,466
You haven't proven yourself
a true hero.

834
00:54:18,633 --> 00:54:21,928
But, Father, I've beaten every
single monster I've come up against.

835
00:54:22,094 --> 00:54:25,306
I-I'm-I'm the most famous person
in all of Greece.

836
00:54:25,473 --> 00:54:29,268
I'm-I-I'm an action figure!

837
00:54:29,435 --> 00:54:32,104
I'm afraid being famous
isn't the same...

838
00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:35,566
as being a true hero.

839
00:54:35,733 --> 00:54:37,109
What more can I do?

840
00:54:37,276 --> 00:54:40,446
It's something you have
to discover for yourself.

841
00:54:40,613 --> 00:54:44,867
- But how can I...
- Look inside your heart.

842
00:54:46,452 --> 00:54:48,329
Father, wait!

843
00:55:04,345 --> 00:55:06,305
On your left
is Hercules' villa.

844
00:55:06,472 --> 00:55:08,724
Our next stop
is the Pecs and Flex Gift Shop...

845
00:55:08,891 --> 00:55:11,978
where you can pick up the great hero's
30-minute workout scroll...

846
00:55:12,144 --> 00:55:14,021
"Buns of Bronze".

847
00:55:14,188 --> 00:55:16,357
At 1:00, you got a meeting
with King Augeas.

848
00:55:16,524 --> 00:55:18,150
He's got a problem
with his stables.

849
00:55:18,317 --> 00:55:19,944
I'd advise you
not to wear your new sandals.

850
00:55:20,111 --> 00:55:22,405
- Phil.
- I told you, don't move!

851
00:55:22,572 --> 00:55:24,574
DGR, the Daughters
of the Greek Revolution.

852
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:27,285
- At 3:00, you gotta get a girdle
from some Amazons.
- Phil.

853
00:55:27,451 --> 00:55:30,413
Phil, what's the point?

854
00:55:32,498 --> 00:55:33,833
That's it!

855
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,877
Keep your toga on, pal.

856
00:55:38,171 --> 00:55:41,424
Yuck! What do you mean,
"What's the point?"

857
00:55:41,591 --> 00:55:43,050
You wanna go to Olympus,
don't ya?

858
00:55:43,217 --> 00:55:47,305
Yeah, but this stuff doesn't seem
to be getting me anywhere.

859
00:55:47,471 --> 00:55:50,141
You can't give up now.
I'm countin' on ya.

860
00:55:50,308 --> 00:55:52,226
I gave this everything I had.

861
00:55:54,770 --> 00:55:57,607
Listen to me, kid.
I seen 'em all.

862
00:55:57,773 --> 00:56:01,819
And I am tellin' you...
and this is the honest-to-Zeus truth...

863
00:56:01,986 --> 00:56:03,946
you got somethin'
I never seen before.

864
00:56:04,113 --> 00:56:05,948
- Really?
- I can feel it...

865
00:56:06,115 --> 00:56:08,618
right down in these stubby
bowlegs of mine.

866
00:56:08,784 --> 00:56:11,746
There is nothin'
you can't do, kid.

867
00:56:13,539 --> 00:56:15,541
- It's him!
- Hey, watch it!

868
00:56:15,708 --> 00:56:17,001
- Watch it! Watch...
- I touched his elbow!

869
00:56:17,168 --> 00:56:20,046
- Hey, girls!
- I got his sweatband!

870
00:56:20,213 --> 00:56:22,423
Phil, help!

871
00:56:22,590 --> 00:56:25,968
- Okay. Escape plan: beta.
- Gotcha.

872
00:56:26,135 --> 00:56:29,889
- Hey! Where is he?
- There he goes! On the veranda!

873
00:56:30,056 --> 00:56:31,933
Whoa!

874
00:56:46,697 --> 00:56:50,034
Let's see. What could be behind
curtain number one?

875
00:56:50,201 --> 00:56:51,786
Meg!

876
00:56:51,953 --> 00:56:54,622
It's all right.
The sea of raging hormones has ebbed.

877
00:56:54,747 --> 00:56:57,333
Gee, i-i-it's
great to see you.

878
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:59,418
I-I-I missed you.

879
00:56:59,585 --> 00:57:02,004
So this is what heroes do
on their days off.

880
00:57:02,171 --> 00:57:04,257
Nah. I'm no hero.

881
00:57:04,423 --> 00:57:06,634
Sure ya are.
everybody in Greece...

882
00:57:06,801 --> 00:57:10,221
thinks you're the greatest thing
since they put the pocket in pita.

883
00:57:10,388 --> 00:57:13,599
I know, it's... it's crazy. You know, I
can't go anywhere without being mobbed.

884
00:57:13,766 --> 00:57:16,227
- I mean...
- You sound like you could use a break.

885
00:57:16,394 --> 00:57:21,190
Think your nanny goat would go berserk
if you played hookey this afternoon?

886
00:57:21,357 --> 00:57:24,569
Oh, gee, I-I don't know. Uh, Phil's got
the rest of the day pretty much booked.

887
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:26,612
Ah, Phil, schmill.

888
00:57:26,779 --> 00:57:29,323
Just follow me out the window,
round the dumbbells.

889
00:57:29,490 --> 00:57:32,159
You lift up the back wall
and we're gone.

890
00:57:37,582 --> 00:57:39,667
Wow. What a day.

891
00:57:39,834 --> 00:57:41,752
First that restaurant by the bay.

892
00:57:41,919 --> 00:57:45,298
And then that, that play,
that, that, that Oedipus thing.

893
00:57:45,464 --> 00:57:47,884
Man! I thought I had problems.

894
00:57:50,428 --> 00:57:55,433
- Psst! Stop foolin' around.
- Yeah. Get the goods, sister.

895
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:59,020
I didn't know that playing hookey
could be so much fun.

896
00:57:59,187 --> 00:58:01,772
Yeah, neither did I.

897
00:58:01,939 --> 00:58:05,193
- Thanks, Meg.
- Oh.

898
00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:07,445
Don't thank me just yet.

899
00:58:07,612 --> 00:58:10,031
- Oh!
- Oop. Careful.

900
00:58:10,198 --> 00:58:12,116
sorry. Weak ankles.

901
00:58:12,283 --> 00:58:16,454
Oh, yeah? Well, maybe you better
sit down for a while.

902
00:58:16,621 --> 00:58:20,625
So, uh, do you
have any problems...

903
00:58:20,791 --> 00:58:22,752
with things like this?

904
00:58:22,919 --> 00:58:25,838
- Uh...
- Weak ankles, I mean.

905
00:58:26,005 --> 00:58:28,799
Oh, uh, no, not really.

906
00:58:28,966 --> 00:58:32,762
No weaknesses whatsoever?

907
00:58:32,929 --> 00:58:35,681
- No trick knee?
- Uh...

908
00:58:35,848 --> 00:58:38,351
Ruptured disks?

909
00:58:40,561 --> 00:58:45,483
No. I'm, I'm, I'm afraid
I'm, uh, fit as a fiddle.

910
00:58:45,650 --> 00:58:49,695
- Wonderboy, you are perfect.
- Thanks.

911
00:58:51,155 --> 00:58:53,533
Whoops!

912
00:58:54,992 --> 00:58:57,036
It looks better that way.

913
00:58:57,203 --> 00:58:59,580
No, it really does.

914
00:59:06,337 --> 00:59:08,422
You know, when, when I was a kid...

915
00:59:08,589 --> 00:59:12,844
I, I would have given anything to be
exactly like everybody else.

916
00:59:13,010 --> 00:59:15,513
You wanted to be
petty and dishonest?

917
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:19,392
- everybody's not like that.
- Yes, they are.

918
00:59:19,559 --> 00:59:22,812
- You're not like that.
- How do you know what I'm like?

919
00:59:22,979 --> 00:59:24,814
All I know is...

920
00:59:24,981 --> 00:59:30,027
you're the most amazing person with
weak ankles I've ever met.

921
00:59:33,614 --> 00:59:35,283
Oh!

922
00:59:35,449 --> 00:59:37,869
Meg, when I'm with you...

923
00:59:38,035 --> 00:59:42,373
I-I don't feel so alone.

924
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:44,959
Sometimes it's better
to be alone.

925
00:59:45,126 --> 00:59:48,504
- What do you mean?
- Nobody can hurt you.

926
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:57,346
Meg? I would never ever hurt you.

927
00:59:57,513 --> 01:00:00,099
And I don't wanna
hurt you, so...

928
01:00:00,266 --> 01:00:02,727
let's both do
ourselves a favour and...

929
01:00:02,894 --> 01:00:07,690
stop this before we...

930
01:00:07,857 --> 01:00:11,694
All right! Break it up!
Break it up! Party's over!

931
01:00:11,861 --> 01:00:14,572
- I've been lookin' all over this town!
- Calm down, mutton man.

932
01:00:14,739 --> 01:00:17,200
- It was all my fault.
- You're already on my list, sister!

933
01:00:17,366 --> 01:00:19,493
So don't make it worse!

934
01:00:21,871 --> 01:00:24,582
And as for you, ya bum,
you're gonna go to the stadium...

935
01:00:24,749 --> 01:00:26,918
and you're gonna be put through
the workout of your life!

936
01:00:27,084 --> 01:00:31,297
- Now get on the horse.
- Okay, okay.

937
01:00:31,464 --> 01:00:34,133
- I'm sorry.
- Ah, he'll get over it.

938
01:00:39,847 --> 01:00:42,767
Move! Move, move,
move, move, move! Move!

939
01:00:48,564 --> 01:00:51,025
Hey, watch it. Watch it.
Watch it.

940
01:00:51,192 --> 01:00:53,402
Keep your goo-goo eyes on the...

941
01:00:55,613 --> 01:00:59,867
That's it. Next time, I drive.

942
01:01:06,958 --> 01:01:10,002
Oh, what's the matter with me?

943
01:01:10,169 --> 01:01:13,798
You'd think a girl would learn.

944
01:01:13,965 --> 01:01:18,261
If there's a prize
for rotten judgment

945
01:01:18,427 --> 01:01:22,306
I guess I've already won that

946
01:01:22,473 --> 01:01:26,936
No man is worth the aggravation

947
01:01:27,103 --> 01:01:30,606
That's ancient history
Been there, done that

948
01:01:30,773 --> 01:01:34,527
Who do ya think you're kidding
He's the earth and heaven toya

949
01:01:34,694 --> 01:01:38,030
Try to keep it hidden
Honey, we can see right through ya

950
01:01:38,197 --> 01:01:40,324
- Oh, no
- Girl, you can't conceal it

951
01:01:40,491 --> 01:01:45,288
We know how you feel
and who you're thinkin' of

952
01:01:45,454 --> 01:01:50,960
Oh, no chance, no way
I won't say it, no, no

953
01:01:51,127 --> 01:01:54,672
You swoon, you sigh
Why deny it, uh-oh

954
01:01:54,839 --> 01:01:58,843
It's too cliche
I won't say I'm in love

955
01:01:59,010 --> 01:02:02,555
Shoo-doo, shoo-doo
Oo-oo-oo

956
01:02:02,722 --> 01:02:06,142
I thought my heart
had learned its lesson

957
01:02:06,309 --> 01:02:09,812
It feels so good
when you start out

958
01:02:09,979 --> 01:02:14,400
- Ah
- My head is screaming, get a grip, girl

959
01:02:14,567 --> 01:02:18,362
Unless you're dyin'
to cry your heart out, oh

960
01:02:18,529 --> 01:02:22,074
You keep on denyin ' who you are
and how you're feelin'

961
01:02:22,241 --> 01:02:26,245
Baby, we're not buyin'
Hon, we saw you hit the ceilin'

962
01:02:26,412 --> 01:02:29,874
Face it like a grown up
When you gonna own up that you

963
01:02:30,041 --> 01:02:32,919
- Got
- Got
- Got it bad

964
01:02:33,085 --> 01:02:38,424
Oh, no chance, no way
I won't say it, no, no

965
01:02:38,549 --> 01:02:42,386
- Give up, but give in
- Check the grin, you're in love

966
01:02:42,553 --> 01:02:46,182
This scene won't play
I won't say I'm in love

967
01:02:46,349 --> 01:02:50,102
You're doin 'flips, read our lips
You're in love

968
01:02:50,269 --> 01:02:52,104
- Shoo-doo, shoo-doo
- You're way off base

969
01:02:52,271 --> 01:02:54,065
- I won't say it
- She won't say love

970
01:02:54,232 --> 01:02:58,069
Get off my case
I won't say it

971
01:02:58,236 --> 01:03:03,574
Girl, don't be proud
It's okay, you're in love

972
01:03:03,699 --> 01:03:06,369
Oh

973
01:03:06,536 --> 01:03:09,664
At least out loud

974
01:03:09,830 --> 01:03:13,459
I won't say I'm in

975
01:03:13,626 --> 01:03:16,420
- Love
- Shoo-doo, shoo-doo, shoo-doo

976
01:03:16,587 --> 01:03:19,757
Shoo-doo
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la

977
01:03:19,924 --> 01:03:22,093
Ha

978
01:03:32,436 --> 01:03:34,605
Hey, what's the buzz, huh, Meg?

979
01:03:34,772 --> 01:03:38,109
What is the weak link
in Wonderboy's chain?

980
01:03:38,276 --> 01:03:42,154
-Get yourself another girl. I'm through.
-I'm sorry. You mind runnin'
that by me again?

981
01:03:42,321 --> 01:03:44,991
I must have had a chunk of brimstone
wedged in my ear or something.

982
01:03:45,157 --> 01:03:49,328
Then read my lips! Forget it.

983
01:03:49,495 --> 01:03:53,958
Meg, Meg, Meg,
my sweet deluded little minion.

984
01:03:54,125 --> 01:03:58,754
Aren't we forgetting one teensy-weensy,
but ever so crucial little, tiny detail?

985
01:03:58,921 --> 01:04:00,756
I own you!

986
01:04:00,923 --> 01:04:05,636
- Oh, oh, I got another horn here.
- You work for me.

987
01:04:05,803 --> 01:04:08,181
That kid's gonna be
doin' laps for a month.

988
01:04:08,347 --> 01:04:11,350
If I say, "Sing",
you say, "Hey, name that tune".

989
01:04:11,517 --> 01:04:15,980
If I say, "l want Wonderboy's head
on a platter", you say...

990
01:04:16,147 --> 01:04:17,982
Medium or well done?

991
01:04:18,149 --> 01:04:22,612
Oh! I knew that dame was trouble.
This is gonna break the kid's heart.

992
01:04:22,778 --> 01:04:25,907
- I'll work on that.
- I'm sorry. You hear that sound?

993
01:04:26,073 --> 01:04:30,661
That's the sound of your freedom
fluttering out the window forever.

994
01:04:30,828 --> 01:04:34,665
I don't care.
I'm not gonna help you hurt him.

995
01:04:34,832 --> 01:04:38,836
I can't believe you're getting
so worked up about some guy.

996
01:04:39,003 --> 01:04:41,339
This one is different.
He's honest and, and he's sweet.

997
01:04:41,506 --> 01:04:43,341
- Please!
- He would never do anything to hurt me.

998
01:04:43,508 --> 01:04:48,262
- He's a guy.
- Besides, O Oneness, you can't beat him.

999
01:04:48,429 --> 01:04:52,808
He has no weaknesses.
He's gonna...

1000
01:04:52,975 --> 01:04:56,479
I think he does, Meg.

1001
01:04:56,646 --> 01:05:00,358
I truly think he does.

1002
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:27,468
- Hey, Phil, what happened to you?
- Kid, we gotta talk.

1003
01:05:27,635 --> 01:05:30,555
Oh, Phil, I just had
the greatest day of my life.

1004
01:05:30,721 --> 01:05:33,975
I, I, I can't stop thinkin'
about Meg.

1005
01:05:34,141 --> 01:05:36,936
- She's somethin' else.
- Kid! I'm tryin' to talk to you!

1006
01:05:37,103 --> 01:05:38,938
Will you come down here
and listen?

1007
01:05:39,105 --> 01:05:43,734
Aw, how can I come down there
when I'm feelin' so up?

1008
01:06:09,051 --> 01:06:10,261
Gotcha!

1009
01:06:10,428 --> 01:06:12,930
Ah, very nice.
What I'm tryin' to say is...

1010
01:06:13,097 --> 01:06:15,600
That if it wasn't foryou,
I never would have met her.

1011
01:06:15,766 --> 01:06:18,019
Oh, I owe you big time,
little guy. I do.

1012
01:06:18,186 --> 01:06:19,437
Will you just knock it off
for a couple of seconds?

1013
01:06:19,604 --> 01:06:22,106
Rule number 38. Come on, Phil.
Keep them up there, huh?

1014
01:06:22,273 --> 01:06:25,193
- Phil, I got two words for ya: duck!
- Listen to me. She's...

1015
01:06:25,359 --> 01:06:26,903
- My dream come true?
- Not exactly.

1016
01:06:27,069 --> 01:06:28,946
- More beautiful than Aphrodite?
- Aside from that!

1017
01:06:29,113 --> 01:06:33,159
- The most wonderful...
- She's a... She's a fraud!

1018
01:06:33,326 --> 01:06:35,786
She's been playin' ya for a sap!

1019
01:06:35,953 --> 01:06:38,831
- Aw, come on. Stop kiddin' around.
- I'm not kiddin' around.

1020
01:06:38,998 --> 01:06:40,833
- She...
- I know you're upset about today,
but that's no reason to...

1021
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,294
- Kid, you're missin' the point.
- The point is, I love her.

1022
01:06:43,461 --> 01:06:45,087
- She don't love you.
- You're crazy.

1023
01:06:45,254 --> 01:06:47,131
- She nothin' but a two-timin'...
- Stop it!

1024
01:06:47,298 --> 01:06:49,592
- No-good, lyin', schemin'...
- Shut up!

1025
01:06:53,971 --> 01:06:57,517
Phil. I... Oh, I'm, I'm sorry.

1026
01:06:57,683 --> 01:07:01,437
Okay, okay, that's it.
You won't face the truth? Fine.

1027
01:07:01,604 --> 01:07:04,023
Phil, wait. Where ya goin'?

1028
01:07:04,190 --> 01:07:08,361
I'm hoppin' the first barge outta here.
I'm goin' home.

1029
01:07:08,528 --> 01:07:10,655
Fine! G...

1030
01:07:10,821 --> 01:07:13,783
Go! I don't... I don't need you.

1031
01:07:16,077 --> 01:07:19,330
I thought you were gonna be
the all-time champ...

1032
01:07:19,497 --> 01:07:22,792
not the all-time chump.

1033
01:07:24,669 --> 01:07:27,505
Jeez Louise,
what got his goat, huh?

1034
01:07:30,466 --> 01:07:32,385
Baboom. Name is Hades,
lord of the dead.

1035
01:07:32,552 --> 01:07:34,512
- Hi. How ya doin'?
- Uh, not now, okay?

1036
01:07:34,679 --> 01:07:37,348
Hey, hey. I only need a few seconds,
and I'm a fast talker, all right?

1037
01:07:37,515 --> 01:07:40,184
See, I've got
this major deal in the works.
A real estate venture, if you will.

1038
01:07:40,351 --> 01:07:42,353
And, Herc, you little devil you.
May I call you Herc?

1039
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:44,856
You seem to be constantly
getting in the way of it, huh?

1040
01:07:45,022 --> 01:07:47,525
- You've got the wrong guy.
- Hear me out, ya little...

1041
01:07:47,692 --> 01:07:49,652
Just hear me out, okay?

1042
01:07:49,819 --> 01:07:52,530
So I would be eternally grateful
if you would just...

1043
01:07:52,697 --> 01:07:55,032
take a day off from
this hero business of yours.

1044
01:07:55,199 --> 01:07:57,118
Jeez, I mean, monsters,
natural disasters.

1045
01:07:57,285 --> 01:07:59,036
- You wait a day, huh?
- You're out of your mind.

1046
01:07:59,203 --> 01:08:03,791
Not so fast, because, ya see,
I do have a little leverage
you might wanna know about.

1047
01:08:05,209 --> 01:08:09,046
- Meg!
- Don't listen, Herc...

1048
01:08:09,213 --> 01:08:11,299
- Let her go!
- Here's the trade-off.

1049
01:08:11,465 --> 01:08:14,260
You give up your strength
for about 24 hours, okay?

1050
01:08:14,427 --> 01:08:16,554
Say, the next 24 hours.

1051
01:08:16,721 --> 01:08:18,598
And Meg here is free as a bird
and safe from harm.

1052
01:08:18,764 --> 01:08:20,892
We dance, we kiss, we schmooze,
we carry on, we go home happy.

1053
01:08:21,058 --> 01:08:23,519
What do ya say? Come on.

1054
01:08:23,686 --> 01:08:25,521
People are... are gonna
get hurt, aren't they?

1055
01:08:25,688 --> 01:08:27,648
Nah! I mean, it's, you know,
it's a possibility.

1056
01:08:27,815 --> 01:08:29,650
It happens 'cause, you know, it's war,
but what can I tell ya?

1057
01:08:29,817 --> 01:08:31,694
Anyway, what do you
owe these people, huh?

1058
01:08:31,861 --> 01:08:34,697
Isn't Meg...
you little smoochy face you...
Isn't she more important than they are?

1059
01:08:34,864 --> 01:08:36,782
- Stop it!
- Isn't she?

1060
01:08:36,949 --> 01:08:39,619
You've gotta swear
she'll be safe from any harm.

1061
01:08:39,744 --> 01:08:41,662
Fine, okay.
I'll give you that one.

1062
01:08:41,829 --> 01:08:43,915
Meg is safe, otherwise
you get your strength right back.

1063
01:08:44,081 --> 01:08:46,125
Yadda, yadda. Fine print. Boilerplate.
Baboom. Okay? We're done.

1064
01:08:46,292 --> 01:08:48,127
What do you say we shake on it?

1065
01:08:48,294 --> 01:08:50,338
Hey, I really don't have,
like, time to bat this around.

1066
01:08:50,505 --> 01:08:52,381
I'm kind of on a schedule here.
I got plans for August. Okay?

1067
01:08:52,548 --> 01:08:55,468
I need an answer, like, now.
Going once, going twice...

1068
01:08:55,635 --> 01:08:59,388
- All right!
- Yes! We're there! Bam!

1069
01:09:06,771 --> 01:09:09,607
You may feel just a little queasy.
It's kind of natural.

1070
01:09:09,774 --> 01:09:11,817
Maybe you should sit down!

1071
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:17,823
Now you know how it feels to be
just like everybody else.

1072
01:09:17,990 --> 01:09:21,410
Isn't it just peachy?

1073
01:09:21,577 --> 01:09:23,829
Oh! You'll love this.
One more thing.

1074
01:09:23,996 --> 01:09:26,666
Meg, babe, a deal's a deal.

1075
01:09:26,791 --> 01:09:29,961
You're off the hook.
And by the way, Herc,

1076
01:09:30,127 --> 01:09:32,213
is she not, like,
a fabulous little actress?

1077
01:09:32,380 --> 01:09:33,798
- Stop it.
- What do you mean?

1078
01:09:33,965 --> 01:09:38,094
I mean your little chickie-poo here
was working for me all the time.

1079
01:09:38,261 --> 01:09:41,973
- Duh.
- You're... You're lying!

1080
01:09:42,139 --> 01:09:46,978
- Help!
- Jeepers, mister, you're really strong.

1081
01:09:47,144 --> 01:09:51,107
- Couldn't have done it without you,
sugar, sweetheart, babe.
- No! It's... It's not like that.

1082
01:09:51,274 --> 01:09:56,153
I didn't mean to...
I-I couldn't... I... I'm so sorry.

1083
01:09:56,320 --> 01:10:00,241
Our hero's a zero!
Our hero's a zero!

1084
01:10:02,285 --> 01:10:06,205
Well, gotta blaze. There's a whole
cosmos up there waiting for me...

1085
01:10:06,372 --> 01:10:08,291
with, hey, my name on it.

1086
01:10:10,626 --> 01:10:14,505
So much for the preliminaries,
and now on to the main event!

1087
01:10:27,518 --> 01:10:30,897
Brothers! Titans!

1088
01:10:31,063 --> 01:10:34,525
Look at you in your squalid prison!

1089
01:10:34,692 --> 01:10:39,655
- Who put you down there?
- Zeus!

1090
01:10:39,822 --> 01:10:42,241
And now that I set you free...

1091
01:10:42,408 --> 01:10:45,870
what is the first thing
you are going to do?

1092
01:10:46,037 --> 01:10:49,749
- Destroy him!
- Good answer.

1093
01:10:52,251 --> 01:10:56,464
Crush Zeus!

1094
01:10:59,008 --> 01:11:02,303
Freeze him!

1095
01:11:06,724 --> 01:11:10,019
Melt Zeus!

1096
01:11:10,186 --> 01:11:14,607
Blow him away!

1097
01:11:17,443 --> 01:11:21,864
Zeus!

1098
01:11:22,031 --> 01:11:23,699
- Uh, guys?
- Huh?

1099
01:11:23,866 --> 01:11:26,619
Olympus would be that way.

1100
01:11:26,786 --> 01:11:30,873
- Zeus!
- Freeze him!

1101
01:11:30,998 --> 01:11:32,875
- Hold it, bright eye.
- Huh?

1102
01:11:33,042 --> 01:11:36,128
I have a special job for you,
my optic friend.

1103
01:11:43,594 --> 01:11:47,223
- Huh? Huh?
- Destroy Zeus!

1104
01:11:47,348 --> 01:11:51,143
Oh, we're in trouble!
Oh, big trouble! I gotta...

1105
01:11:51,310 --> 01:11:53,604
My lord and lady,
the Titans have escaped.

1106
01:11:53,771 --> 01:11:55,648
And they're practically
at our gates!

1107
01:11:55,815 --> 01:11:59,861
Sound the alarm!
Launch an immediate counterattack!

1108
01:12:00,027 --> 01:12:02,613
- Go! Go!
- Gone, babe.

1109
01:12:05,157 --> 01:12:07,326
Huh?

1110
01:12:12,123 --> 01:12:17,253
- Charge!
- On to battle!

1111
01:12:27,847 --> 01:12:30,224
Ya windbag!

1112
01:12:31,475 --> 01:12:34,145
Boom, badda-boom!
Boom, boom!

1113
01:12:37,732 --> 01:12:41,611
Hercules!

1114
01:12:41,777 --> 01:12:45,031
Where are you?

1115
01:12:46,741 --> 01:12:49,660
- What can we do?
- Where is Hercules?

1116
01:12:49,827 --> 01:12:52,663
Yeah, Hercules will save us.

1117
01:12:52,830 --> 01:12:56,167
Hercules!

1118
01:12:56,334 --> 01:13:01,964
Come out! Face me!

1119
01:13:02,131 --> 01:13:05,468
Oh, what are you doing?
Without your strength, you'll be killed.

1120
01:13:05,635 --> 01:13:08,429
- Hercules!
- There are worse things.

1121
01:13:08,596 --> 01:13:12,391
- Run!
- Wait! Stop!

1122
01:13:12,558 --> 01:13:17,647
- Hey, look! It's Hercules.
- Thank the gods! We're saved!

1123
01:13:17,813 --> 01:13:21,859
So, you mighty Hercules.

1124
01:13:28,741 --> 01:13:30,952
- Oh!
- Oh!

1125
01:13:35,623 --> 01:13:39,377
Easy, horsefeathers.
Whoa! Stop twitching!

1126
01:13:39,544 --> 01:13:43,631
Listen.
Hercules is in trouble.

1127
01:13:43,756 --> 01:13:46,717
We've gotta find Phil. He's the only one
who can talk some sense into him.

1128
01:13:52,056 --> 01:13:54,267
Get back! Blast you!

1129
01:13:58,354 --> 01:14:02,608
- Ooh! Chihuahua!
- Zeus!

1130
01:14:03,901 --> 01:14:06,946
Come on! Hury up!
We're shovin' off here!

1131
01:14:07,071 --> 01:14:10,908
Phil! Phil,
Hercules needs your help.

1132
01:14:11,075 --> 01:14:13,411
What does he need me for
when he's got friends like you?

1133
01:14:13,578 --> 01:14:18,291
- He won't listen to me.
- Good! He's finally learned somethin'.

1134
01:14:18,457 --> 01:14:22,587
Look, I know what I did was wrong,
but this isn't about me. It's about him.

1135
01:14:22,712 --> 01:14:26,090
If you don't help him now,
Phil, he'll die.

1136
01:14:26,257 --> 01:14:28,384
I need more thunderbolts!

1137
01:14:28,551 --> 01:14:32,930
Uh, Hephaestus has been captured,
my lord. everyone's been captured.

1138
01:14:33,097 --> 01:14:36,726
I've been captured.
Hey, hey, watch the glasses.

1139
01:14:41,814 --> 01:14:44,650
Zeusy, I'm home!

1140
01:14:44,817 --> 01:14:48,613
Hades! You're behind this?

1141
01:14:48,738 --> 01:14:52,033
You're correct, sir!

1142
01:14:54,994 --> 01:14:57,288
Flea!

1143
01:15:01,459 --> 01:15:04,420
- Hercules!
- Phil.

1144
01:15:04,587 --> 01:15:07,798
Come on, kid. Come on. Fight back.
Come on. You can take this bum.

1145
01:15:07,965 --> 01:15:12,845
- This guy's a pushover. Look at him.
- You were right all along, Phil.

1146
01:15:13,012 --> 01:15:16,390
- Dreams are for rookies.
- No, no, no, no, no, kid.

1147
01:15:16,557 --> 01:15:20,603
Givin' up is for rookies. I came back
'cause I'm not quittin' on ya.

1148
01:15:20,728 --> 01:15:24,815
I'm willin' to go the distance.
How about you?

1149
01:15:27,318 --> 01:15:30,238
Me bite off head!

1150
01:15:34,283 --> 01:15:37,370
Whoa, baby!

1151
01:15:50,049 --> 01:15:52,343
Hercules! Look out!

1152
01:15:52,510 --> 01:15:55,513
Meg! No!

1153
01:16:04,146 --> 01:16:06,816
What's happening?

1154
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:10,570
H-Hades' deal is broken.

1155
01:16:11,696 --> 01:16:14,574
He promised I wouldn't get hurt.

1156
01:16:14,740 --> 01:16:19,829
Meg, why... why... why did ya...
You didn't have to...

1157
01:16:19,996 --> 01:16:24,208
Oh, people always
do crazy things...

1158
01:16:24,333 --> 01:16:26,878
when they're in love.

1159
01:16:27,044 --> 01:16:30,923
Oh, Meg. Meg, I... I...

1160
01:16:31,090 --> 01:16:35,887
Are you always this articulate?

1161
01:16:38,055 --> 01:16:43,394
You... You haven't got much time.
You can still stop Hades.

1162
01:16:43,477 --> 01:16:46,689
I'll watch over her, kid.

1163
01:16:46,856 --> 01:16:50,985
You're gonna be all right.
I promise.

1164
01:16:53,529 --> 01:16:56,324
Let's go, Pegasus!

1165
01:16:58,201 --> 01:17:00,536
Hup, two, three, four!
Come on, everybody!

1166
01:17:00,703 --> 01:17:03,372
- I can't hear you!
- Oh, oh, that.

1167
01:17:03,539 --> 01:17:07,710
I swear to you, Hades,
when I get out of th...

1168
01:17:07,877 --> 01:17:10,421
I'm the one giving orders now,
bolt boy.

1169
01:17:10,546 --> 01:17:13,299
And I think
I'm gonna like it here.

1170
01:17:13,466 --> 01:17:17,553
Don't get too
comfortable, Hades!

1171
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:21,098
- Hercules!
- This ought to even the odds!

1172
01:17:24,101 --> 01:17:27,897
- Yeah, Hercules! Thank you, man.
- Get them!

1173
01:17:31,067 --> 01:17:33,152
Whoa! Hey!

1174
01:17:33,319 --> 01:17:36,697
No! Get him! Not me! Him!

1175
01:17:38,991 --> 01:17:43,704
Follow the fingers! Him!
The yutz with the horse!

1176
01:17:50,461 --> 01:17:53,381
- Thank you, my boy.
- Nice horsey!

1177
01:17:53,548 --> 01:17:58,344
My intentions were pure.
I really was attracted to you.

1178
01:18:00,263 --> 01:18:05,518
- Throw!
- Ah! Now watch your old man work!

1179
01:18:05,685 --> 01:18:07,520
Uh-oh!

1180
01:18:10,606 --> 01:18:13,067
Guys, get your
titanic rears in gear...

1181
01:18:13,234 --> 01:18:16,445
and kick some Olympian butt.

1182
01:18:16,612 --> 01:18:19,365
Whoa! Is my hair out?

1183
01:18:45,683 --> 01:18:50,021
Thanks a ton, Wonderboy. But at least
I've got one swell consolation prize...

1184
01:18:50,188 --> 01:18:54,567
a friend of yours
who's dying to see me.

1185
01:18:54,734 --> 01:18:55,860
Meg.

1186
01:19:26,224 --> 01:19:27,767
Meg.

1187
01:19:34,190 --> 01:19:36,651
Meg, no.

1188
01:19:56,337 --> 01:19:58,381
Oh, I'm sorry, kid.

1189
01:20:01,092 --> 01:20:03,427
There's some things
you just can't change.

1190
01:20:06,722 --> 01:20:08,641
Yes, I can.

1191
01:20:12,436 --> 01:20:15,106
We were so close!

1192
01:20:15,273 --> 01:20:18,109
So close. We tripped
at the finish line. Why?

1193
01:20:18,234 --> 01:20:22,613
Because our little nut, Meg,
has to go all noble.

1194
01:20:26,450 --> 01:20:28,995
- Where's Meg?
- Oh. Look who's here.

1195
01:20:29,161 --> 01:20:33,666
- Wonderboy, you are too much.
- Let her go.

1196
01:20:33,833 --> 01:20:37,628
Get a grip. Come here. Come here.
Let me show you around.

1197
01:20:38,421 --> 01:20:41,924
Hmph. Well, well.
It's a small underworld, after all, huh?

1198
01:20:43,176 --> 01:20:46,929
- Meg!
- No, no, no. Mustn't touch.

1199
01:20:47,096 --> 01:20:49,765
You see, Meg's running
with a new crowd these days...

1200
01:20:49,891 --> 01:20:52,059
and not a very lively one at that.

1201
01:20:53,519 --> 01:20:56,814
You like making deals.
Take me in Meg's place.

1202
01:20:56,981 --> 01:21:02,320
Oh, hmph. The son of my hated rival
trapped forever in a river of death.

1203
01:21:02,486 --> 01:21:04,822
- Going once!
- Hmm? Is there a downside to this?

1204
01:21:04,989 --> 01:21:07,950
- Going twice!
- Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay!

1205
01:21:08,117 --> 01:21:11,537
You get her out.
She goes; you stay.

1206
01:21:14,665 --> 01:21:18,044
Oh, you know what slipped my mind?
You'll be dead before
you can get to her.

1207
01:21:18,211 --> 01:21:21,255
That's not a problem, is it?

1208
01:21:46,155 --> 01:21:48,324
Oh!

1209
01:21:48,491 --> 01:21:50,660
What's the matter
with these scissors?

1210
01:21:50,826 --> 01:21:53,287
The thread won't cut.

1211
01:22:01,045 --> 01:22:03,548
This is...
This is impossible!

1212
01:22:03,714 --> 01:22:06,551
You... You... You can't be alive.
You'd have to be a, a...

1213
01:22:06,676 --> 01:22:09,387
A god?

1214
01:22:12,807 --> 01:22:16,561
Hercules, stop!
Ya can't do this to me! Ya can't...

1215
01:22:16,727 --> 01:22:19,897
Fine. Okay. Listen.
Okay, well, I deserved that.

1216
01:22:20,064 --> 01:22:23,901
Herc, Herc, Herc? Can we talk?
Y-Your dad? He's a fun guy, right?

1217
01:22:24,068 --> 01:22:26,153
So maybe you could
put in a word with him...

1218
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:28,406
and he'd kind of blow
this whole thing off, you know?

1219
01:22:28,573 --> 01:22:31,659
Meg, Meg, talk to him.
You know, a little schmooze, uh...

1220
01:22:34,579 --> 01:22:39,834
Get away from me! Don't touch me!
Get your slimy souls off me!

1221
01:22:40,001 --> 01:22:42,378
He's not gonna be happy
when he gets outta there.

1222
01:22:42,503 --> 01:22:45,590
- You mean, if he gets outta there.
- Taxi!

1223
01:22:45,756 --> 01:22:47,592
- If? If is good.
- Taxi!

1224
01:22:47,717 --> 01:22:51,387
I don't feel so good.
I-I feel a little...

1225
01:23:14,452 --> 01:23:18,206
Wonderboy, what...
Why did you...

1226
01:23:19,624 --> 01:23:24,670
People always do crazy things
when they're in love.

1227
01:23:32,803 --> 01:23:35,056
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1228
01:23:46,984 --> 01:23:49,487
Three cheers
for the mighty Hercules!

1229
01:23:49,654 --> 01:23:52,573
Oh, yeah.
Flowers for everybody! Oh!

1230
01:24:03,793 --> 01:24:05,837
Hercules!

1231
01:24:06,003 --> 01:24:11,259
Hercules, we're so proud of you.

1232
01:24:11,425 --> 01:24:13,928
Mother.

1233
01:24:15,096 --> 01:24:18,224
Fine work, my boy!
You've done it!

1234
01:24:18,391 --> 01:24:20,685
You're a true hero.

1235
01:24:20,852 --> 01:24:24,897
You were willing to give your life
to rescue this young woman.

1236
01:24:25,022 --> 01:24:28,818
For a true hero isn't measured
by the size of his strength...

1237
01:24:28,985 --> 01:24:32,697
but by the strength
of his heart.

1238
01:24:32,864 --> 01:24:37,660
Now, at last, my son...

1239
01:24:37,827 --> 01:24:40,621
you can come home.

1240
01:24:53,801 --> 01:24:58,264
Congratulations, Wonderboy.
You'll make one heck of a god.

1241
01:25:06,397 --> 01:25:11,110
Father, this is the moment
I've always dreamed of...

1242
01:25:11,235 --> 01:25:14,739
but...

1243
01:25:14,906 --> 01:25:19,744
a life without Meg,
even an immortal life...

1244
01:25:19,911 --> 01:25:22,747
would be empty.

1245
01:25:24,415 --> 01:25:26,959
I...

1246
01:25:27,126 --> 01:25:29,462
I wish to stay
on Earth with her.

1247
01:25:29,629 --> 01:25:32,298
I finally know where I belong.

1248
01:25:46,103 --> 01:25:47,813
Hit it, ladies.

1249
01:25:47,980 --> 01:25:51,609
Oh, gonna shout it
from the mountaintops

1250
01:25:51,776 --> 01:25:53,277
A staris born

1251
01:25:53,444 --> 01:25:55,780
It's the time
for pullin 'out the stops

1252
01:25:55,947 --> 01:25:57,448
A star is born

1253
01:25:57,615 --> 01:26:01,494
- Honey, hit us with a hallelu
- That kid came shinin' through

1254
01:26:01,661 --> 01:26:03,496
Girl, sing the song

1255
01:26:03,663 --> 01:26:09,335
Come blow your horn
A star is born, a star is born

1256
01:26:09,502 --> 01:26:13,756
- He's a hero who can please the crowd
- A star is born

1257
01:26:13,923 --> 01:26:17,635
Come on, everybody, shout out loud
A star is born

1258
01:26:17,802 --> 01:26:21,848
Just remember in the darkest hour
Within your heart's the power

1259
01:26:22,014 --> 01:26:25,768
For makin 'you a hero too

1260
01:26:25,935 --> 01:26:29,021
So don't lose hope
when you're for lorn

1261
01:26:29,188 --> 01:26:31,524
- That's Phil's boy!
- Just keep your eyes

1262
01:26:31,691 --> 01:26:34,819
- You just keep your eyes
- Upon the skies
- Upon the skies

1263
01:26:34,986 --> 01:26:36,571
- every night, a star is
- every night

1264
01:26:36,737 --> 01:26:38,656
- Right in sight, a star is
- Burning bright

1265
01:26:38,823 --> 01:26:43,953
Burning bright
A star is born

1266
01:32:30,883 --> 01:32:32,844
What do ya say?

of somethin' but me. I got nothin'.

1268
01:32:35,972 --> 01:32:38,766
I-I'm here with nothin'.
Anybody listenin'?

1269
01:32:38,933 --> 01:32:41,227
It's like I'm... What am I,
an echo or something?

1270
01:32:41,394 --> 01:32:44,480
Hello? Hello?
Am I talking to, what?

1271
01:32:44,647 --> 01:32:48,150
Hyperspace? Hello, it's me.
Nobody listens.
