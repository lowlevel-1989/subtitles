00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:39,372
Long ago,
in the faraway land of ancient Greece,

2
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:44,919
there was a golden age of powerful
gods and extraordinary heroes.

3
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:50,883
And the greatest and strongest of all
these heroes was the mighty Hercules.

4
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:54,470
But what is the measure of a true hero?

5
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:57,557
- Ah, that is what our stoy is...
- Will you listen to him?

6
00:00:57,641 --> 00:01:00,560
He's makin' the story sound like
some Greek tragedy.

7
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:04,230
- Lighten up, dude.
- We'll take it from here, darling.

8
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:07,567
You go, girl.

9
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:13,656
We are the Muses, goddesses of
the arts and proclaimers of heroes.

10
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:15,533
Heroes like Hercules.

11
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:17,577
Honey, you mean "Hunk-ules."

12
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:19,912
Ooh, I'd like to make
some sweet music with him...

13
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:26,961
Our story actually begins long before
Hercules, many aeons ago.

14
00:01:27,286 --> 00:01:28,725

Hercules!

00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:24,120
Behave yourself.

41
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,458
Oh, look at this.

42
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,794
Look how cute he is.

43
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:40,761
Hah! Oh, he's strong like his dad, hmm?

44
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:45,057
Whoa! Excuse me! Hot stuff coming through!
Excuse me. One side, Ares.

45
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:48,728
Why, Hermes, they're lovely.

46
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:51,272
Yeah, you know,
I had Orpheus do the arrangement.

47
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,566
Isn't that too nutty?

48
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,775
Fabulous party. You know,

49
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:58,821
I haven't seen this much love in a room
since Narcissus discovered himself.

50
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:04,160
Dear, keep those away from the baby.

51
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,412
Oh, he won't hurt himself.

52
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,956
Let the kid have a little fun.

53
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:19,675
On behalf of my son,

54
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:24,263
I want to thank you all
for your wonderful gifts!

55
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:26,015
What about our gift, dear?

56
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:29,268
Well, let's see here.
We'll take... Hmm, yes.

57
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:33,940
A little cirrus
and a touch of nimbostratus

58
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:37,526
and a dash of cumulus.

59
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:44,450
His name is Pegasus,

60
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,745
and he's all yours, son.

61
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:01,092
Mind his head.

62
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:03,094
He's so tiny.

63
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:10,142
My boy.

64
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:13,270
My little Hercules.

65
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:15,898
How sentimental.

66
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:19,652
You know,
I haven't been this choked up

67
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:23,239
since I got a hunk of moussaka
caught in my throat! Huh?

68
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,909
So is this an audience or a mosaic?

69
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:29,453
Hey, how you doin'?
Lookin' good. Nice dress.

70
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:34,000
So, Hades, you finally made it.
How are things in the underworld?

71
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:37,003
Well, they're just fine.
You know, a little dark, a little gloomy.

72
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:39,255
And, as always,
hey, full of dead people.

73
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,506
What are you gonna do? Ah!

74
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,384
There's the little sunspot.
Little snootchie.

75
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:46,554
And here is a sucker
for the little sucker, eh?

76
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:48,431
Here you go. Ya just...

77
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,393
Sheesh!

78
00:05:52,728 --> 00:05:54,562
Uh, powerful little tyke.

79
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:58,357
Come on, Hades. Don't be such a stiff.
Join the celebration!

80
00:05:58,442 --> 00:05:59,608
Hey.

81
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:03,904
Love to, babe, but unlike you gods
lounging about up here,

82
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:06,532
I regrettably have a full-time gig

83
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:10,161
that you, by the way,
so charitably bestowed on me, Zeus.

84
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:13,247
So, can't. Love to, but can't.

85
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:17,251
You ought to slow down.
You'll work yourself to death.

86
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:20,296
Hah! Work yourself to death!

87
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:24,258
Oh, I kill myself!

88
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:28,054
If only. If only.

89
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:32,308
If there's one god you don't want to
get steamed up, it's Hades.

90
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,102
'Cause he had an evil plan.

91
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:39,690
<i><font color=yellow>♪ He ran the underworld</i>

92
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:43,569

were dull and uncouth</i>

93
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:47,114

94
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,160

95
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:55,581
<i><font color=yellow>♪ He had a plan to shake things up</i>

96
00:06:55,665 --> 00:07:02,671
<i><font color=yellow>♪ And that's the gospel truth ♪</i>

97
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:12,348
Pain!

98
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,851
Coming, your most lugubriousness. Ow!

99
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,106
Panic!

100
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:23,025
Oh, I'm sory. I can handle it!

101
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,369
- Pain! Oh!
- And Panic!

102
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,287
- Reporting for duty!
- Reporting for duty!

103
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:36,372
Fine, fine, fine.

104
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,708
Just let me know
the instant the Fates arrive.

105
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:40,918
Oh. They're here.

106
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:44,421
What? The Fates are here,
and you didn't tell me?

107
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:50,553
- We are worms! Worthless worms!
- We are worms! Worthless worms!

108
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:55,182
Memo to me, memo to me.
Maim you after my meeting.

109
00:07:57,352 --> 00:08:02,648
Darling, hold that mortal's thread of life

110
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,526
good and tight.

111
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,240
Incoming!

112
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,668
Ladies! I am so sorry that I'm...

113
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:23,752
- Late!
- Late!

114
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:27,047
- We knew you would be.
- We know everything.

115
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:29,216
- Past.
- Present.

116
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:31,343
And Future.

117
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:34,305
Indoor plumbing, it's gonna be big.

118
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:37,141
Great, great. Anyway, see, ladies,
I was at this party, and I lost track of...

119
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:40,519
- We know!
- Yeah. I know you know.

120
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:44,190
So here's the deal. Zeus,

121
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:48,027
Mr High and Mighty, Mr "Hey, you,
get off of my cloud," now he has...

122
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:51,614
- A bouncing baby brat.
- We know!

123
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:55,868
I know you know. I know.
I got it. I got the concept.

124
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:56,911
So let me just ask.

125
00:08:56,995 --> 00:09:00,080
Is this kid gonna mess up
my hostile takeover bid, or what?

126
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:01,248
What do you think?

127
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:05,711
Oh, no you don't.
We're not supposed to reveal the future.

128
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,006
Wait. I'm sorry. Time out. Can I...

129
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,716
Can I ask you a question, by the way?
Are you...

130
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,968
Did you cut your hair or something?
You look fabulous.

131
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:16,639
I mean, you look like
a Fate worse than death.

132
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:21,769
- Oh, gross!
- Yech! It's blinkin'!

133
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:26,232
Ladies, please.

134
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:29,818
My fate is in your lovely hands.

135
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:32,488
- Yeah!
- Oh, all right.

136
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,787
In 18 years precisely,

137
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:45,876
the planets will align ever so nicely.

138
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:47,127
Ay, verse. Oy.

139
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:49,838
The time to act will be at hand.

140
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:54,260
Unleash the Titans,
your monstrous band.

141
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:55,719
Mm-hmm. Good, good.

142
00:09:55,804 --> 00:10:01,100
Then the once-proud Zeus
will finally fall,

143
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:07,439
and you, Hades, will rule all!

144
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:10,192
Yes! Hades rules!

145
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:13,237
A word of caution to this tale.

146
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:14,488
Excuse me?

147
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:19,159
Should Hercules fight, you will fail.

148
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,125
What?

149
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:29,169
Okay, fine, fine. I'm cool. I'm fine.

150
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,466
Pain? Panic? Got a little riddle for ya.

151
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:37,720
How do you kill a god?

152
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:41,265
- I do not know!
- You can't. They're immortal?

153
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,600
Bingo! They're immortal.

154
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:48,897
So, first you got to turn
the little sunspot mortal.

155
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,346
- Huh?
- Wha... What is it?

156
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,264
- The baby!
- The baby!

157
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,230
Hercules!

158
00:11:30,531 --> 00:11:31,318
Oh!

159
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:40,616
No!

160
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:42,534
Now we did it!

161
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:44,703
Zeus is gonna use us
for target practice!

162
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:46,705
Just hang onto the kid, Panic.

163
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:51,502
Hurry!

164
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:54,004
Let's just kill the kid
and get it over with, okay?

165
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:58,258
Here you go, kid.
A little Grecian formula.

166
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:02,721
Look at that! He's changing.
Can we do it now?

167
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:07,976
No, no, no, he has to drink the whole potion.
Every last drop.

168
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,269
Who's there?

169
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,985
Alcmene, over here.

170
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:21,281
Oh, you poor thing.

171
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,617
- Don't cry.
- Is anybody there?

172
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,452
- Now?
- Now.

173
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:30,082
Well, he must have been abandoned.

174
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,001
Amphitryon, for so many years

175
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:36,171
we've prayed to the gods
to bless us with a child.

176
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:40,300
- Perhaps they've answered our prayers.
- Perhaps they have.

177
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:42,052
"Hercules"?

178
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:04,032
Help, help, help!

179
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,785
Hades is gonna kill us
when he finds out what happened.

180
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,288
You mean, if he finds out.

181
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:11,623
Of course he's gonna f...

182
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,001
If. If is good.

183
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,504
It was tragic.

184
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:20,632
Zeus led all the gods
on a frantic search.

185
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:24,595
But by the time they found the baby,
it was too late.

Look out!

201
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,463
Oops! S-S-sorry, guys!

202
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,882
- Hey, watch where you're goin'.
- Sunday driver!

203
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:49,930
Thanks, son.

204
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:53,767
When old Penelope twisted her ankle
back there, I thought we were done for.

205
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,185
No problem, Pop.

206
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:59,064
Uh, don't-don't-don't unload just yet.
First, I have to finagle with Phideas.

207
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,524
Okay.

208
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:03,902
Oops. Sorry, Penelope.

209
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:07,239
Now, Hercules, this time, please just...

210
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,616
I know. I know.

211
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:11,577
Stay by the cart.

212
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,204
That's my boy.

213
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:19,793
Oh, my goodness. Whoa!

214
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,628
Careful!

215
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,173
- Why, thank you.
- No problem.

216
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:27,551
Why, Hercules!

217
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:28,719
I-I-It's you!

218
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:31,930
- Let me help you with that.
- No, no, no, no, no. I got it!

219
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:34,683
I'm fine. You just run along.

220
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,351
- Are you sure?
- Oh, yes.

221
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,020
Absolutely.

222
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,526
Yo! Give it here!

223
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:46,612
Hey, you need an extra guy?

224
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,824
Uh, sorry, Herc.

225
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:54,661
Uh, we already got five,
and we want to keep it an even number.

226
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:56,538
Hey, wait a second. Five isn't an even...

227
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,498
- See ya, Herc.
- What a geek!

228
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:02,669
- Destructo Boy.
- Maybe we should call him "Jerkules."

229
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,136
- Yeah!
- Heads up!

230
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,387
I-I got it!

231
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:13,930
No! Stop!

232
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:17,979
Uh-oh.

233
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:19,728
Oh, no.

234
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:22,731
It's okay.

235
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,989
Hey! Whoa!

236
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:40,165
- Son!
- Hang on, Pop! Be right back!

237
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,793
Oh, my! Oh, no! Don't! No, no, no, no!

238
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:45,253
No, no, no, no, no, no!

239
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:53,178
Watch out!

240
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,779
Nice catch, Jerkules.

241
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:13,365
Son...

242
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:19,204
This is the last straw, Amphitryon!

243
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:21,415
That boy is a menace!

244
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:24,292
He's too dangerous
to be around normal people!

245
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:28,338
He didn't mean any harm.
He's just a kid.

246
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:32,259
He-He just can't control his strength.

247
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:34,219
I'm warning you.

248
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:38,473
You keep that-that-that...
freak away from here!

249
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:41,184
Freak! Yeah, go away!

250
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:58,702
Ah, son, you shouldn't let those things
they said back there get to you.

251
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:03,915
But, Pop, they're right. I-I am a freak.
I-I try to fit in. I really do.

252
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,501
I just can't.

253
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:13,425
Sometimes I feel like
I really don't belong here,

254
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:18,346
like I'm supposed to be someplace else.

What's your hurry?

Didn't know you had a famous father,
did you?

301
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,736
Surprise!

302
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,197
Look how you've grown.

303

If you're my father,
that would make me a...

- A god.

now to know the truth.

310
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:29,639
But why did you leave me on Earth?
Didn't you want me?

311
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,307
Of course we did.

312
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:34,352
Your mother and I
loved you with all our hearts.

313
00:22:34,437 --> 00:22:38,106
Someone stole you from us
and turned you mortal,

314
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,192
and only gods
can live on Mount Olympus.

315
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:43,194
And you can't do a thing?

316
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:45,321
I can't, Hercules, but you can.

317
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:48,491
R-Really? W-What?
I'll do anything.

318
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,870
Hercules, if you can prove yourself
a true hero on Earth,

319
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:53,955
your godhood will be restored!

320
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,458
A true hero. Great!

321
00:22:57,084 --> 00:23:00,587
Uh, exactly how do you
become a true hero?

322
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:05,175
First, you must seek out Philoctetes,
the trainer of heroes.

323
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:08,053
Seek out Philoctetes. Right. I'll...

324
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:10,346
- Whoa!
- Whoa! Hold your horses!

325
00:23:10,431 --> 00:23:12,307
Which reminds me.

326
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:24,486
Ha-ha! You probably don't remember Pegasus,
but you two go way back, son.

327
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,120
Oh, Pegasus!

328
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:39,584
He's a magnificent horse
with the brain of a bird.

329
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:44,422
I'll find Philoctetes
and become a true hero.

330
00:23:44,507 --> 00:23:45,840
That's the spirit!

331
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:47,467
I won't let you down, Father!

332
00:23:49,225 --> 00:23:50,067
Yee-hah!

333
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:52,472
Good luck, son.

Uh, no. Can you help us?

352
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:38,786
We're looking for someone
called Philoctetes.

353
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,164
Call me Phil.

354
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,624
- Phil!
- Ow!

355
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:45,376
Boy, am I glad to meet you!
I'm Hercules.

356
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:47,962
And this is Pegasus.

357
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,507
Animals! Disgusting!

358
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:53,218
I need your help.

359
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:55,386
I want to become a hero, a true hero.

360
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:00,266
- Sorry, kid. Can't help ya.
- Wait!

361
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:02,352
- Whoo!
- Uh, sorry.

362
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:07,065
- Why not?
- Two words, I am retired.

363
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:10,068
Look, I gotta do this.

364
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:11,861
Haven't you ever had a dream,

365
00:26:11,946 --> 00:26:14,656
something you wanted so bad
you'd do anything?

366
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:20,828
Kid, come inside.
I want to show you something.

367
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:32,215
Watch it! That was part
of the mast of the Argo.

368
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,050
- The Argo?
- Yeah.

369
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:36,344
Who do you think
taught Jason how to sail?

370
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:37,720
Cleopatra?

371
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:40,265
I trained all those would-be heroes.

372
00:26:40,391 --> 00:26:45,186
Odysseus, Perseus, Theseus.
A lot of "yeuseus."

373
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:49,607
And every single one of those bums
let me down flatter than a discus.

374
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:52,193
None of 'em could go the distance.

375
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:55,697
And then there was Achilles.

376
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:59,909
Now, there was a guy who had it all,
the build, the foot speed.

377
00:26:59,994 --> 00:27:04,414
He could jab, he could take a hit,
he could keep on comin'.

378
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:07,166
But that furshlugginer heel of his!

379
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:10,169
He barely gets nicked there once
and kaboom!

380
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:12,213
He's history.

381
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:16,009
Yeah, I had a dream once.

382
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:19,595
I dreamed I was gonna train
the greatest hero there ever was.

383
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:25,977
So great, the gods would hang a picture
of him in the stars all across the sky,

384
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:29,314
and people would say,
"That's Phil's boy."

385
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:31,316
That's right.

386
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,192
Eh, but dreams are for rookies.

387
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:35,445
A guy can only take
so much disappointment.

388
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:37,822
But I'm different than
those other guys, Phil!

389
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:41,242
I can go the distance.
Come on. I'll show you.

390
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:43,995
Geez! You don't give up, do ya?

391
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,413
Watch this.

392
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:51,836
Holy Hera.

393
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,340
You know, maybe if I...
No! Snap out of it!

394
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:57,550
I'm too old
to get mixed up in this stuff again.

395
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:01,971
But if I don't become a true hero, I'll
never be able to rejoin my father, Zeus.

396
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:03,473
Hold it!

397
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:06,601
Zeus is your father, right?

398
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:11,105
Zeus. The big guy. He's your daddy.

399
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,982
Mr Lightning Bolts!

400
00:28:13,067 --> 00:28:15,151
Read me a book, would ya, Da-da?

401
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:18,279
Zeus! "Once upon a time..."

402
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:19,530
It's the truth!

403
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:21,157

Next stop, Olympus.

461
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:31,847
All right, just take it easy, champ.

462
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:34,183
I am ready. I want to get off this island.

463
00:31:34,268 --> 00:31:36,686
I want to see battles and monsters.

464
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,604
Rescue some damsels.

465
00:31:38,689 --> 00:31:40,773
You know, heroic stuff.

466
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:44,402
- Well...
- Aw, come on, Phil!

467
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:47,905
Well, okay. Okay, you want a road test?
Saddle up, kid.

468
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:50,324
- We're goin' to Thebes!
- Ya-hoo!

469
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:54,245
- So what's in Thebes?
- A lot of problems.

470
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:57,873
It's a big, tough town.
Good place to start buildin' a rep.

471
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:04,255
Sounds like your basic DID,
Damsel in Distress.

472
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,681
Not so fast, sweetheart.

473
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:16,267
I swear, Nessus. Put me down or I'll...

474
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:19,312
Whoo! I like 'em fiey!

475
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:21,147
Now, remember, kid.

476
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:23,149
First, analyse the situation.

477
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:25,484
Don't just barrel in there
without thinking. Eh?

478
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,989
He's losin' points for this!

479
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:32,033
- You don't know what you're...
- Halt!

480
00:32:35,037 --> 00:32:37,830
Step aside, two legs.

481
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:41,751
Pardon me, my good, uh, uh, sir.

482
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:43,586
I'll have to ask you to
release that young...

483
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:46,631
- Keep movin', junior.
- Lady.

484
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:50,217
But you... Are-Aren't you
a damsel in distress?

485
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:53,387
I'm a damsel, I'm in distress.

486
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:56,274
I can handle this. Have a nice day.

487
00:32:56,793 --> 00:33:02,045
Uh... Ma'am, I'm afraid you may be
too close to the situation to realise...

488
00:33:03,858 --> 00:33:08,152
- Ohhh! What are you doin'? Get your sword!
- Sword. Right, right.

489
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:11,405
Rule number 15,
a hero is only as good as his weapon!

490
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:22,708
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold it! Hold on!
He's gotta do it on his own.

491
00:33:22,793 --> 00:33:25,836
Come on, kid! Concentrate!

492
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:27,588
Use your head!

493
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:38,057
All right! Not bad, kid!

494
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:41,227
Not exactly what I had in mind,
but not bad.

495
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:47,900
Oh, gee, miss.
I'm, I'm really sorry. That was dumb.

496
00:33:48,402 --> 00:33:50,027
Yeah.

497
00:33:51,238 --> 00:33:52,613
Excuse me.

498
00:33:57,744 --> 00:34:01,372
Nice work! Excelente!

499
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:03,541
Is Wonderboy here for real?

500
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:07,411
What are you talkin' about?
Of course he's real. Whoa!

501
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:13,300
And by the way, sweet cheeks,
I'm real, too.

502
00:34:13,432 --> 00:34:14,737
Ugh!

503
00:34:15,905 --> 00:34:18,983
Yee-hah! Ya-hoo!

504
00:34:25,172 --> 00:34:26,979
Whoa!

505
00:34:52,549 --> 00:34:54,633
- How was that, Phil?
- Rein it in, rookie.

506
00:34:54,718 --> 00:34:57,553
You can get away with mistakes
like those in the minor decathlons,

507
00:34:57,637 --> 00:35:00,264
but this is the big leagues!

508
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,266
At least I beat him, didn't I?

509
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:06,145
Next time, don't let your guard down
because of a pair of big goo-goo eyes!

510
00:35:06,272 --> 00:35:11,484
D-oh! It's like I keep tellin' ya.
You gotta stay focused, and... You...

511
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:24,121
Are you, uh, all right. Miss, uh...

512
00:35:24,206 --> 00:35:28,083
Megara. My friends call me Meg.
At least, they would if I had any friends.

513
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:32,880
So did they give you a name
along with all those rippling pectorals?

514
00:35:32,716 --> 00:35:36,708
Uh, uh, uh, I'm, um, uh...

515
00:35:36,886 --> 00:35:39,512
- Uh, uh...
- Are you always this articulate?

516
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:42,640
Hercules. My... My name is Hercules.

517
00:35:43,183 --> 00:35:46,185
Herc... Huh.
I think I prefer Wonderboy.

518
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:51,273
So, uh, uh... How-how-how'd you
get mixed up with the, uh...

519
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:53,818
Pinhead with hooves?
Well, you know how men are.

520
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:57,655
They think that "No" means "Yes," and
"Get lost" means "Take me, I'm yours."

521
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:03,118
Don't worry.
Shorty here can explain it to ya later.

522
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:08,749
Well, thanks for everything, Herc.
It's been a real slice.

523
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:12,628
Wait! Um, can we give you a ride?

524
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:19,301
Uh, I don't think your pinto
likes me very much.

525
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:24,348
Pegasus? Oh, no. Don't be silly.
He'd be more than happy to... Ow!

526
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:32,231
I'll be all right. I'm a big, tough girl.
I tie my own sandals and everything.

527
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:35,860
Bye-bye, Wonderboy.

528
00:36:36,278 --> 00:36:37,778
Bye.

529
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:42,324
She's something. Isn't she, Phil?

530
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:45,119
Yeah, ye... Oh, yeah.
She's really something.

531
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,662
A real pain in the patella!

532
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:49,957
Earth to Herc!
Come in, Herc! Come in, Herc!

533
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,877
We got a job to do, remember?

534
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:54,712
Thebes is still waitin'.

535
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:57,673
Yeah. Yeah. I know.

536
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:10,603
Aw, how cute.

537
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:13,314
A couple of rodents
looking for a theme park.

538
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:16,859
Who you callin' a rodent, sister?
I'm a bunny!

539
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:18,360
A-And I'm his gopher!

540
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:20,117
Ta-dah!

541
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:22,031
I thought I smelled a rat.

542
00:37:22,115 --> 00:37:23,824
Meg?

543
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:25,743
Speak of the devil.

544
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:29,914
Meg, my little flower, my little bird,
my little nut, Meg.

545
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:31,957
What exactly happened here?

546
00:37:32,042 --> 00:37:34,043
I thought you were gonna
persuade the river guardian

547
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:35,711
to join my team for the uprising,

548
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:38,589
and here I am,
kind of river guardian-less.

549
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:42,718
I gave it my best shot,
but he made me an offer I had to refuse.

550
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:45,429
Fine. So, instead of subtracting
two years from your sentence,

551
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,264
hey, I'm gonna add two on, okay?

552
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:48,432
Give that your best shot.

553
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:51,560
It wasn't my fault.
It was this wonderboy, Hercules.

554
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:56,190
Hercules?
Why does that name ring a bell?

555
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:59,109
I don't know.
Um, maybe we owe him money?

556
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:03,781
- What was that name again?
- Hercules.

557
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:05,950
He comes on with
this big, innocent farm boy routine,

558
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:07,743
but I could see through that
in a Peloponnesian minute.

559
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:08,786
Wait a minute.

560
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:12,081
Wasn't Hercules the name
of that kid we were supposed to...

561
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:14,208
- Oh, my gods!
- Oh, my gods!

562
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,668
Run for it!

563
00:38:15,752 --> 00:38:18,963
So you took care of him, huh?

564
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:21,048
Dead as a door nail.

565
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,968
Weren't those your exact words?

566
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:25,928
This might be a different Hercules.

567
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:29,682
Yeah! I mean, Hercules
is a very popular name nowadays!

568
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:33,143
Remember, like, a few years ago,
every other boy was named Jason,

569
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:34,937
and the girls were all named Brittany?

570
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:39,566
I'm about to rearrange the cosmos,

571
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:46,615
and the one schlemiel who can louse
it up is waltzing around in the woods!

572
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,663
Wait. Wait, big guy.

573
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:55,124
- We can still cut in on his waltzing.
- That's right!

574
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:58,377
And-And at least we made him mortal.
That's a good thing.

575
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:00,087
Didn't we?

576
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,590
Hmm. Fortunately for the three of you,

577
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:07,511
we still have time to correct
this rather egregious oversight.

578
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:11,056
And this time, no foul-ups. Wow!

579
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:20,357
- Is that all one town?
- One town, a million troubles.

580
00:39:20,442 --> 00:39:24,695
The one and only Thebes.
The Big Olive itself.

581
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:27,990
If you can make it there,
you can make it anywhere.

582
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:39,376
Stick with me, kid.
This city is a dangerous place.

583
00:39:39,461 --> 00:39:43,464
- Look where you're goin', numbskull!
- Hey, I'm walkin' here!

584
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:46,133
You see what I mean?
I'm tellin' you, wackos.

585
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:49,553
Pitta bread. Pitta bread.
Get your pitta bread here.

586
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:52,521
- Hey, Mack.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

587
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,642
- You wanna buy a sundial?
- He's not interested, all right?

588
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:56,769
Come on, kid.

589
00:39:56,853 --> 00:39:59,980
The end is coming! Can't you feel it?

590
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:04,318
Yes, yes. Thank you for the info. Yes.
We'll ponder that for a while.

591
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,694
Just stare at the sidewalk. Come on.

592
00:40:05,779 --> 00:40:08,238
Don't make eye contact.
People here are nuts.

593
00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:10,491
That's because
they live in a city of turmoil.

594
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:11,617
Trust me, kid.

595
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:13,994
You're gonna be
just what the doctor ordered.

596
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:19,291
It was tragic!
We lost everything in the fire.

597
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:22,669
Everything except old Snowball here.

598
00:40:23,463 --> 00:40:26,507
Now, were the fires
before or after the earthquake?

599
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:28,759
They were after the earthquake.
I remember.

600
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,260
But before the flood.

601
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:33,764
Don't even get me started
on the crime rate.

602
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:37,434
Thebes has certainly
gone downhill in a hurry.

603
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:39,103
Tell me about it.

604
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:41,230
It seems like every time I turn around,

605
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:43,607
there's some new monster
wreaking havoc and I...

606
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:47,277
All we need now is a plague of locusts.

607
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:52,282
That's it! I'm movin' to Sparta!

608
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:53,617
Excuse me.

609
00:40:54,744 --> 00:41:00,374
It, uh... seems to me that
what you folks need is a hero.

610
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:03,669
Yeah, and who are you?

611
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:10,384
I'm Hercules, and, uh...
I happen to be a hero.

612
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:14,096
- Is that so?
- A hero!

613
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:18,725
- Have you ever saved a town before?
- Uh, no. Uh, not exactly, but I...

614
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:21,311
Have you ever
reversed a natural disaster?

615
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:23,814
Well, uh, no.

616
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:27,025
Oh, listen to this.
He's just another chariot chaser.

617
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:29,278
- This we need.
- That's a laugh.

618
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:31,697
- Don't you pea brains get it?
- Hmm?

619
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:34,074
This kid is the genuine article.

620
00:41:34,284 --> 00:41:38,162
Hey, isn't that the goat-man
who trained Achilles?

621
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:39,913
Watch it, pal.

622
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:42,249
Yeah, you're right.

623
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,835
Hey, uh, nice job on those heels!

624
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:47,504
Ya missed a spot!

625
00:41:47,589 --> 00:41:49,590
You... I got your heel right here!

626
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:51,800
I'll wipe that stupid grin
off your face! You...

627
00:41:51,885 --> 00:41:55,179
Hey, Phil! Phil! Phil! Take it easy. Phil.

628
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:57,139
What are you, crazy? Sheesh.

629
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:03,312
Young man, we need
a professional hero, not an amateur.

630
00:42:04,731 --> 00:42:06,857
Well, wait. Stop!

631
00:42:12,155 --> 00:42:16,033
How am I supposed to prove myself
a hero if nobody will give me a chance?

632
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:17,242
You'll get your chance.

633
00:42:17,327 --> 00:42:20,996
You just need some kind of
catastrophe or disaster.

634
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,164
Please.

635
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:25,459
Help! Please!
There's been a terrible accident!

636
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,711
- Meg?
- Speakin' of disasters.

637
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:31,423
Wonderboy! Hercules!
Thank goodness!

638
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:32,966
Wha-Wha-What's wrong?

639
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:36,386
Oh! Outside of town, two little boys.
Th-They were playing in the gorge.

640
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:39,139
Th-There was this rock slide,
a terrible rock slide.

641
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:41,975
- They're trapped!
- Kids? Trapped?

642
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,644
Phil, this is great!

643
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:45,520
You're really choked up about this,
aren't ya?

644
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:46,563
Come on!

645
00:42:46,648 --> 00:42:51,401
No, I... You don't under...
I, I have this terrible fear of heights!

646
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:59,034
I'm right behind ya, kid! Whoo!

647
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:01,036
I'm way behind ya, kid.

648
00:43:01,621 --> 00:43:03,497
I got a fur wedgie.

649
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:12,214
- Are you okay?
- I'll be fine.

650
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:14,508
Just get me down
before I ruin the upholstery.

651
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:17,636
- Help! I can't breathe!
- Hurry!

652
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,180
- Get us out!
- We're suffocating!

653
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:24,559
Somebody call IX-I-I!

654
00:43:24,644 --> 00:43:26,270
Easy, fellas. You'll be all right.

655
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:30,857
- We can't last much longer!
- Get us out before we get crushed!

656
00:43:49,711 --> 00:43:51,920
- How you boys doin'?
- We're okay now.

657
00:43:52,005 --> 00:43:55,632
Jeepers, mister. You're really strong.

658
00:43:55,717 --> 00:43:59,219
Well, try to be a little more careful
next time, okay, kids?

659
00:43:59,304 --> 00:44:00,971
We sure will.

660
00:44:06,436 --> 00:44:08,395
A stirring performance, boys.

661
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,314
I was really moved.

662
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:13,900
"Jeepers, mister"?

663
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:17,195
I was going for innocence.

664
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,491
And, hey, two thumbs
way, way up for our leading lady.

665
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:23,285
What a dish. What a doll.

666
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:26,079
Get outta there, you big lug,
while you still can.

667
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:28,790
Phil, I-I did great.

668
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:31,001
They even applauded, sort of.

669
00:44:33,129 --> 00:44:36,715
Huh! I hate to burst your bubble, kid,
but that ain't applause.

670
00:44:44,182 --> 00:44:46,975
Ph-Ph-Ph-Phil?
What do you call that thing?

671
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:48,268
Two words.

672
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:51,438
Am-scray!

673
00:44:54,317 --> 00:44:58,695
Let's get ready to rumble!

674
00:45:04,911 --> 00:45:07,537
That's it. Dance around! Dance around!

675
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:10,749
Watch the teeth. Watch the teeth.
Keep going. Come on. Come on.

676
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:14,294
Lead with your left.
Lead with your left! Your other left!

677
00:46:08,141 --> 00:46:11,601
Whoa! All right! All right!
You're bad! Okay!

678
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:15,355
See, Phil? That... That wasn't so hard.

679
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,149
Kid, kid, kid.

680
00:46:17,233 --> 00:46:18,733
How many horns do ya see?

681
00:46:18,818 --> 00:46:20,569
Six?

682
00:46:20,653 --> 00:46:23,530
Eh, close enough.
Let's get you cleaned up.

683
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:30,620
Guys, guys, relax.

684
00:46:30,705 --> 00:46:32,581
It's only half-time.

685
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:37,669
That doesn't sound good.

686
00:46:45,303 --> 00:46:46,928
Definitely not good!

687
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:18,668
Will you forget the head-slicing thing?

688
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:29,846
I don't think we covered
this one in basic training!

689
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:43,777
My favourite part of the game,

690
00:47:46,948 --> 00:47:48,782
sudden death.

691
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:15,600
Oh. There goes another one.
Just like Achilles.

692
00:48:18,187 --> 00:48:20,063
Game.

693
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:21,982
Set.

694
00:48:22,066 --> 00:48:23,441
Match.

695
00:48:47,216 --> 00:48:52,304
Phil, you gotta admit.
That was pretty heroic.

696
00:48:52,388 --> 00:48:56,933
Ya did it, kid! Ya did it!
You won by a landslide!

697
00:48:59,562 --> 00:49:01,646
Hades mad.

698
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:07,152
Well, what do ya know?

699
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:15,160
From that day forward,
our boy Hercules could do no wrong.

700
00:49:15,244 --> 00:49:18,663

I throw everything I've got at him
and it doesn't even...

00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:51,858
What are those?

757
00:51:52,327 --> 00:51:56,070
Oh, I don't know.
I-I thought they looked kinda dashing.

758
00:51:56,155 --> 00:51:59,908
I've got 24 hours to get rid of this bozo,

759

up for 18 years goes up in smoke,

and you are wearing his merchandise!

761
00:52:18,344 --> 00:52:19,427
Thirsty?

762
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:32,065
Looks like your game's over.

763
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:34,901
Wonderboy is hitting
every curve you throw at him.

764
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:37,695
Oh, yeah.

765
00:52:39,615 --> 00:52:41,366
I wonder if maybe

766
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:47,747
I haven't been throwing
the right curves at him, Meg, my sweet.

767
00:52:48,207 --> 00:52:49,999
Don't even go there.

768
00:52:50,084 --> 00:52:54,629
See, he's gotta have a weakness
because everybody's got a weakness.

769
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:57,173
I mean, for what?
Pandora, it was the box thing.

770
00:52:57,258 --> 00:52:59,926
For the Trojans, hey.
They bet on the wrong horse, okay?

771
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,887
We simply need to
find out Wonderboy's.

772
00:53:02,972 --> 00:53:05,139
I've done my part. Get your little imps...

773
00:53:05,224 --> 00:53:06,391
They couldn't handle him as a baby.

774
00:53:06,475 --> 00:53:09,853
I need somebody
who can handle him as a man.

775
00:53:09,937 --> 00:53:11,938
Hey, I've sworn off manhandling.

776
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:16,025
Well, you know, that's good because that's what
got you into this jam in the first place, isn't it?

777
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:19,529
You sold your soul to me
to save your boyfriend's life.

778
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:22,198
And how does this creep thank you?

779
00:53:22,283 --> 00:53:25,368
By running off with some babe.

780
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:27,537
He hurt you real bad,
didn't he, Meg? Huh?

781
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:29,581
Look, I learned my lesson, okay?

782
00:53:29,665 --> 00:53:34,210
Which is exactly why I got a feelin'
you're gonna leap at my new offer.

783
00:53:34,295 --> 00:53:37,338
You give me the key
to bringing down Wonder Breath,

784
00:53:37,423 --> 00:53:43,428
and I give you the thing that
you crave most in the entire cosmos,

785
00:53:43,888 --> 00:53:45,805
your freedom.

786
00:53:49,385 --> 00:53:49,961
Ha!

787
00:53:49,977 --> 00:53:51,561
You should have been there, Father.

788
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:56,900
I mangled the Minotaur,
grappled with the Gorgon.

789
00:53:56,984 --> 00:53:58,234
Just like Phil told me.

790
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:02,155
I analysed the situation,
controlled my strength and kicked.

791
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:06,492
The crowds went wild!

792
00:54:08,829 --> 00:54:10,246
Thank you. Thank you.

793
00:54:10,624 --> 00:54:15,585
Hah! You're doin' great, son.
You're doing your old man proud.

794
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:17,879
I'm glad to hear you say that, Father.

795
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:20,340
I've been waiting for this day
a long time.

796
00:54:20,383 --> 00:54:22,592
Hmm. What day is that, son?

797
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:25,720
The day I rejoin the gods.

798
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:29,724
You've done wonderfully.
You really have, my boy.

799
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:31,643
You're just not there yet.

800
00:54:31,727 --> 00:54:35,772
You haven't proven yourself a true hero.

801
00:54:35,856 --> 00:54:39,275
But, Father, I've beaten every single
monster I've come up against.

802
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:42,612
I-I'm-I'm the most famous person
in all of Greece.

803
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:46,574
I'm-I-I'm an action figure!

804
00:54:46,659 --> 00:54:52,288
I'm afraid being famous
isn't the same as being a true hero.

805
00:54:52,373 --> 00:54:54,123
What more can I do?

806
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:57,710
It's something
you have to discover for yourself.

807
00:54:57,795 --> 00:55:02,048
- But how can I...
- Look inside your heart.

808
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,468
Father, wait!

809
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:23,695
On your left is Hercules' villa.

810
00:55:23,779 --> 00:55:26,114
Our next stop is
the Pecs and Flex Gift Shop

811
00:55:26,198 --> 00:55:27,198
where you can pick up

812
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:31,244
the great hero's 30-minute
workout scroll Buns of Bronze.

813
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:33,663
At 1:00,
you got a meeting with King Augeas.

814
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:35,498
He's got a problem with his stables.

815
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:37,333
I'd advise you
not to wear your new sandals.

816
00:55:37,418 --> 00:55:39,752
- Phil?
- I told you, don't move!

817
00:55:39,837 --> 00:55:41,462
DGR, the Daughters of
the Greek Revolution.

818
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:42,588
- Phil.
- At 3:00,

819
00:55:42,673 --> 00:55:44,674
you gotta get a girdle
from some Amazons.

820
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:47,802
Phil, what's the point?

821
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:51,222
That's it!

822
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:53,266
Keep your toga on, pal.

823
00:55:56,854 --> 00:55:58,646
Yuck! What do you mean,
"What's the point?"

824
00:55:58,731 --> 00:56:00,481
You wanna go to Olympus, don't ya?

825
00:56:00,566 --> 00:56:04,652
Yeah, but this stuff doesn't seem
to be getting me anywhere.

826
00:56:04,737 --> 00:56:07,321
You can't give up now.
I'm countin' on ya.

827
00:56:07,406 --> 00:56:09,699
I gave this everything I had.

828
00:56:11,994 --> 00:56:14,871
Listen to me, kid. I seen 'em all.

829
00:56:14,955 --> 00:56:19,167
And I am tellin' you,
and this is the honest-to-Zeus truth,

830
00:56:19,251 --> 00:56:22,253
- you got somethin' I never seen before.
- Really?

831
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:26,007
I can feel it right down
to these stubby bowlegs of mine.

832
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:28,968
There is nothin' you can't do, kid.

833
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:31,637
It's him!

834
00:56:32,306 --> 00:56:33,639
Hey, watch it! Watch it! Watch...

835
00:56:33,724 --> 00:56:37,477
- I touched his elbow! Hey, girls!
- I got his sweatband!

836
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:39,812
Phil, help!

837
00:56:39,897 --> 00:56:42,398
- Okay. Escape plan, beta.
- Gotcha.

838
00:56:43,442 --> 00:56:44,901
Hey. Where is he?

839
00:56:44,985 --> 00:56:47,320
There he goes! On the veranda!

840
00:57:03,879 --> 00:57:04,879
Whoa! Let's see.

841
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:07,423
What could be behind
curtain number one?

842
00:57:07,508 --> 00:57:08,758
Meg!

843
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:11,969
It's all right.
The sea of raging hormones has ebbed.

844
00:57:12,054 --> 00:57:15,098
Gee, i-i-it's great to see you.

845
00:57:15,182 --> 00:57:16,808
I-I-I missed you.

846
00:57:16,892 --> 00:57:19,352
So this is what heroes do
on their days off.

847
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:21,687
Nah. I'm no hero.

848
00:57:21,772 --> 00:57:24,107
Sure ya are. Everybody in Greece

849
00:57:24,191 --> 00:57:26,692
thinks you're the greatest thing
since they put the pocket in pitta.

850
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:29,445
I know, it's... it's crazy.

851
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:31,280
You know, I can't go anywhere
without being mobbed.

852
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:33,616
- I mean...
- You sound like you could use a break.

853
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:36,828
Think your nanny goat
would go berserk

854
00:57:36,912 --> 00:57:38,621
if you played hooky this afternoon?

855
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:40,206
Oh, gee, I-I don't know.

856
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:41,958
Uh, Phil's got the rest of the day
pretty much booked.

857
00:57:42,042 --> 00:57:45,002
Ah, Phil, schmill. Just follow me.

858
00:57:45,087 --> 00:57:49,382
Out the window, round the dumbbells,
you lift up the back wall and we're gone.

859
00:57:54,763 --> 00:57:56,973
Wow. What a day.

860
00:57:57,057 --> 00:58:02,520
First, that restaurant by the bay,
and then that play, that Oedipus thing.

861
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:05,148
Man! I thought I had problems.

862
00:58:09,236 --> 00:58:12,780
- Stop foolin' around!
- Yeah. Get the goods, sister.

863
00:58:12,865 --> 00:58:16,367
I didn't know that
playing hooky could be so much fun.

864
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:20,204
- Yeah. Neither did I.
- Thanks, Meg.

865
00:58:21,183 --> 00:58:24,250
Oh. Don't thank me just yet.

866
00:58:25,044 --> 00:58:27,295
- Oh!
- Oop. Careful.

867
00:58:27,379 --> 00:58:29,463
Sorry. Weak ankles.

868
00:58:29,548 --> 00:58:32,967
Oh, yeah? Well, maybe you better
sit down for a while.

869
00:58:34,261 --> 00:58:39,473
So, uh, do you have any problems
with things like this?

870
00:58:41,435 --> 00:58:43,144
- Uh...
- Weak ankles, I mean.

871
00:58:43,237 --> 00:58:46,063
Oh, uh, no, not really.

872
00:58:46,148 --> 00:58:49,984
No weaknesses whatsoever?

873
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:52,153
- No trick knee?
- Uh...

874
00:58:52,821 --> 00:58:55,489
Ruptured disks?

875
00:58:57,659 --> 00:59:01,621
No. I'm, I'm, I'm afraid
I'm, uh, fit as a fiddle..

876
00:59:02,748 --> 00:59:05,124
Wonderboy, you are perfect.

877
00:59:05,584 --> 00:59:06,960
Thanks.

878
00:59:08,205 --> 00:59:09,483
Whoops!

879
00:59:12,216 --> 00:59:14,383
It looks better that way.

880
00:59:14,468 --> 00:59:16,802
No, it really does.

881
00:59:23,602 --> 00:59:25,895
You know, when I was a kid,

882
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:30,066
I, I would have given anything
to be exactly like everybody else.

883
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:32,777
You wanted to be petty and dishonest?

884
00:59:32,861 --> 00:59:34,028
Everybody's not like that.

885
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:36,739
Yes, they are.

886
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:38,616
You're not like that.

887
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:40,368
How do you know what I'm like?

888
00:59:40,452 --> 00:59:47,458
All I know is you're the most amazing
person with weak ankles I've ever met.

889
00:59:51,138 --> 00:59:52,410
Oh!

890
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:58,511
Meg, when I'm with you,
I-I don't feel so alone.

891
00:59:59,763 --> 01:00:02,265
Sometimes it's better to be alone.

892
01:00:02,349 --> 01:00:03,599
What do you mean?

893
01:00:03,684 --> 01:00:05,768
Nobody can hurt you.

894
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:10,731
Meg?

895
01:00:11,191 --> 01:00:14,735
I would never, ever hurt you.

896
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:21,033
And I don't wanna hurt you, so let's both
do ourselves a favour and stop this

897
01:00:22,494 --> 01:00:24,745
before we...

898
01:00:25,205 --> 01:00:29,041
All right! Break it up! Break it up!
Party's over!

899
01:00:29,126 --> 01:00:31,961
- I been lookin' all over this town!
- Calm down, mutton man.

900
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:33,337
It was all my fault.

901
01:00:33,422 --> 01:00:36,257
You're already on my list, sister,
so don't make it worse!

902
01:00:39,261 --> 01:00:41,971
And as for you, ya bum,
you're gonna go to the stadium

903
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:44,015
and you're gonna be put through
the workout of your life!

904
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:47,393
- Now get on the horse.
- Okay, okay.

905
01:00:48,729 --> 01:00:51,355
- I'm sorry.
- Ah, he'll get over it.

906
01:00:57,070 --> 01:01:00,156
Move! Move, move,
move, move, move! Move!

907
01:01:05,871 --> 01:01:10,124
Hey, watch it, watch it! Watch it!
Keep your goo-goo eyes on the...

908
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:16,505
That's it. Next time, I drive.

909
01:01:24,181 --> 01:01:27,224
Oh, what's the matter with me?

910
01:01:27,309 --> 01:01:30,144
You'd think a girl would learn.

911
01:01:31,063 --> 01:01:35,316
<i><font color=yellow>♪ If there's a prize for rotten judgement</i>

912
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:39,278
<i><font color=yellow>♪ I guess I've already won that</i>

913
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:43,949

What is the weak link
in Wonderboy's chain?

947
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:57,833
Get yourself another girl.
I'm through.

948
01:03:57,918 --> 01:03:59,710
I'm sorry. Do you mind
runnin' that by me again?

01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:02,463
I must have had a chunk of brimstone
wedged in my ear or something.

01:04:02,547 --> 01:04:06,675
Then read my lips! Forget it.

01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:11,263
Meg, Meg, Meg,
my sweet, deluded little minion.

952
01:04:11,348 --> 01:04:16,143
Aren't we forgetting one teensy-weensy,

I own you!

954
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:22,900
- Oh, oh, I got another horn here.
- You work for me.

955
01:04:22,984 --> 01:04:25,361
That kid's gonna be
doin' laps for a month.

If I say, "Sing," you say,
"Hey, name that tune."

957
01:04:28,782 --> 01:04:33,285
If I say, "I want Wonderboy's head
on a platter," you say...

958
01:04:33,411 --> 01:04:35,454
Medium or well-done.

959
01:04:36,164 --> 01:04:40,042
I knew that dame was trouble.
This is gonna break the kid's heart.

960
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:43,212
- I'll work on that.
- I'm sorry. You hear that sound?

961
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:48,133
That's the sound of your freedom
fluttering out the window forever.

962
01:04:48,218 --> 01:04:51,345
I don't care.
I'm not gonna help you hurt him.

963
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:56,141
I can't believe you're
getting so worked up about some guy.

964
01:04:56,226 --> 01:04:58,477
This one is different.
He's honest, and he's sweet...

965
01:04:58,562 --> 01:04:59,562
Please!

966
01:04:59,646 --> 01:05:01,397
- He would never do anything to hurt me.
- He's a guy!

967
01:05:01,481 --> 01:05:05,693
Besides, O oneness,
you can't beat him.

968
01:05:05,777 --> 01:05:09,572
He has no weaknesses. He's gonna...

969
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:13,742
I think he does, Meg.

970
01:05:13,827 --> 01:05:17,162
I truly think he does.

971
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:42,646
Hey, Phil! What happened to you?

972
01:05:42,731 --> 01:05:44,148
Kid, we gotta talk.

973
01:05:44,232 --> 01:05:47,901
Oh, Phil I just had
the greatest day of my life!

974
01:05:47,986 --> 01:05:50,321
I, I, I can't stop thinking about Meg.

975
01:05:51,239 --> 01:05:52,781
She's something else.

976
01:05:52,866 --> 01:05:56,118
Kid, I'm tryin' to talk to ya!
Will you come down here and listen?

977
01:05:56,202 --> 01:06:01,040
How can I come down there
when I'm feeling so up?

978
01:06:26,316 --> 01:06:27,816
Gotcha!

979
01:06:27,901 --> 01:06:30,235
Ah, very nice!
What I'm tryin' to say is...

980
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:32,863
That if it wasn't for you,
I never would have met her.

981
01:06:32,947 --> 01:06:34,782
Oh, I owe you big time,
little guy. I do.

982
01:06:34,866 --> 01:06:36,617
Will you just knock it off
for a couple of seconds?

983
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:39,328
Rule number 38. Come on, Phil.
Keep them up there, huh?

984
01:06:39,412 --> 01:06:42,498
- Phil, I got two words for ya, duck!
- Listen to me! She's...

985
01:06:42,582 --> 01:06:43,999
- A dream come true?
- Not exactly.

986
01:06:44,084 --> 01:06:46,210
- More beautiful than Aphrodite?
- Aside from that!

987
01:06:46,294 --> 01:06:50,506
- The most wonderful...
- She's a... She's a fraud!

988
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:53,175
She's been playin' ya for a sap!

989
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:56,303
- Aw, come on. Stop kiddin' around.
- I'm not kiddin' around.

990
01:06:56,388 --> 01:06:58,097
- She...
- I know you're upset about today,
but that's no reason to...

991
01:06:58,181 --> 01:06:59,223
Kid, you're missin' the point.

992
01:06:59,307 --> 01:07:01,725
- The point is, I love her.
- She don't love you.

993
01:07:01,810 --> 01:07:04,019
- You're crazy.
- She's nothin' but a two-timin'...

994
01:07:04,104 --> 01:07:06,188
- Stop it!
- No-good, lyin', schemin'...

995
01:07:06,272 --> 01:07:07,606
Shut up!

996
01:07:10,944 --> 01:07:12,778
Phil. I...

997
01:07:13,822 --> 01:07:14,863
Oh, I'm, I'm sorry.

998
01:07:14,948 --> 01:07:18,867
Okay, okay, that's it.
You won't face the truth? Fine.

999
01:07:18,952 --> 01:07:21,453
Phil, wait. Where you going?

1000
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:25,040
I'm hoppin' the first barge out of here.
I'm goin' home.

1001
01:07:25,792 --> 01:07:27,876
Fine! G...

1002
01:07:27,961 --> 01:07:30,963
Go! I don't... I don't need you.

1003
01:07:33,341 --> 01:07:36,593
I thought you were gonna be
the all-time champ,

1004
01:07:36,678 --> 01:07:39,179
not the all-time chump.

1005
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:44,810
Geez Louise! What got his goat, huh?

1006
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:49,773
Name is Hades, Lord of the Dead.

1007
01:07:49,858 --> 01:07:51,900
- Hi. How ya doin'?
- Uh, not now, okay?

1008
01:07:51,985 --> 01:07:54,653
Hey, hey. I only need a few seconds
and I'm a fast talker, all right?

1009
01:07:54,738 --> 01:07:57,573
See, I've got the major deal in the works.
A real estate venture, if you will.

1010
01:07:57,657 --> 01:07:59,742
And Herc, you little devil you.
May I call you Herc?

1011
01:07:59,826 --> 01:08:02,077
You seem to be constantly
getting in the way of it, huh?

1012
01:08:02,162 --> 01:08:03,370
You've got the wrong guy.

1013
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:06,957
Hear me out, ya little...
Just hear me out, okay?

1014
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:09,084
So I would be eternally grateful

1015
01:08:09,169 --> 01:08:12,254
if you would just take a day off
from this hero business of yours.

1016
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:15,466
Jeez, I mean, monsters, natural disasters.
You wait a day, okay?

1017
01:08:15,550 --> 01:08:17,760
- You're out of your mind.
- Not so fast, because, ya see,

1018
01:08:17,844 --> 01:08:21,221
I do have a little leverage
you might wanna know about.

1019
01:08:22,015 --> 01:08:24,057
- Meg!
- Don't listen, Herc...

1020
01:08:26,603 --> 01:08:28,604
- Let her go!
- Here's the trade-off.

1021
01:08:28,688 --> 01:08:31,774
You give up your strength
for about 24 hours, okay?

1022
01:08:31,858 --> 01:08:33,859
Say the next 24 hours.

1023
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:35,986
And Meg here is free as a bird
and safe from harm.

1024
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:38,238
We dance, we kiss, we schmooze,
we carry on, we go home happy.

1025
01:08:38,323 --> 01:08:39,740
What do ya say? Come on.

1026
01:08:40,867 --> 01:08:42,868
People are gonna get hurt, aren't they?

1027
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:46,497
Nah! I mean, it's a possibility.
It happens 'cause, you know, it's war.

1028
01:08:46,581 --> 01:08:49,166
But what can I tell ya? Anyway,
what do you owe these people, huh?

1029
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:52,085
Isn't Meg, little smoochy face you,
isn't she more important than they are?

1030
01:08:52,170 --> 01:08:54,213
- Stop it!
- Isn't she?

1031
01:08:54,297 --> 01:08:56,965
You've gotta swear
she'll be safe from any harm.

1032
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:58,967
Fine, okay. I'll give you that one.

1033
01:08:59,052 --> 01:09:01,720
Meg is safe, otherwise
you get your strength right back.

1034
01:09:01,805 --> 01:09:05,390
Yadda, yadda. Fine print. Boilerplate.
Baboom. Okay? We're done.
What d'ya say we shake on it?

1035
01:09:05,475 --> 01:09:07,810
Hey, I really don't have, like,
time to bat this around.

1036
01:09:07,894 --> 01:09:09,686
I'm kind of on a schedule here.
I got plans for August. Okay?

1037
01:09:09,771 --> 01:09:12,898
I need an answer, like, now.
Going once, going twice...

1038
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:15,400
- All right!
- Yes, we're there! Bam!

1039
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:26,745
You may feel just a little queasy.
It's kinda natural.

1040
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:28,747
Maybe you should sit down!

1041
01:09:30,959 --> 01:09:35,045
Now you know how it feels
to be just like everybody else.

1042
01:09:35,129 --> 01:09:38,090
Isn't it just peachy?

1043
01:09:38,883 --> 01:09:41,093
Oh! You'll love this. One more thing.

1044
01:09:41,177 --> 01:09:45,722
Meg, babe, a deal's a deal.
You're off the hook.

1045
01:09:46,474 --> 01:09:49,601
And by the way, Herc,
is she not a fabulous little actress?

1046
01:09:49,686 --> 01:09:51,186
- Stop it.
- What do you mean?

1047
01:09:51,271 --> 01:09:55,524
I mean your little chickie-poo here
was working for me all the time.

1048
01:09:56,526 --> 01:09:58,610
- Duh.
- You're... You're lying!

1049
01:09:59,571 --> 01:10:04,366
- Help!
- Jeepers, mister, you're really strong.

1050
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:07,035
Couldn't have done it without you,
sugar, sweetheart, babe.

1051
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,453
No! It's... It's not like that.

1052
01:10:08,538 --> 01:10:11,415
I didn't mean to... I-I couldn't... I...

1053
01:10:11,791 --> 01:10:13,667
I'm so sorry.

1054
01:10:13,751 --> 01:10:18,088
Our hero's a zero! Our hero's a zero!

1055
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:21,049
Well, gotta blaze.

1056
01:10:21,134 --> 01:10:25,679
There's a whole cosmos up there
waiting for me with, hey, my name on it.

1057
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:31,727
So much for the preliminaries,
and now on to the main event!

1058
01:10:44,782 --> 01:10:48,076
Brothers! Titans!

1059
01:10:48,161 --> 01:10:51,413
Look at you in your squalid prison!

1060
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:54,583
Who put you down there?

1061
01:10:54,667 --> 01:10:56,793
Zeus!

1062
01:10:56,878 --> 01:11:03,342
And now that I set you free, what is
the first thing you are going to do?

1063
01:11:03,676 --> 01:11:07,054
- Destroy him!
- Good answer.

1064
01:11:09,432 --> 01:11:11,435
Crush Zeus!

1065
01:11:16,147 --> 01:11:19,358
Freeze him!

1066
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:26,239
Melt Zeus!

1067
01:11:27,325 --> 01:11:32,204
Blow him away!

1068
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:36,875
Zeus!

1069
01:11:39,170 --> 01:11:40,796
- Uh, guys?
- Huh?

1070
01:11:41,255 --> 01:11:43,173
Olympus would be that way.

1071
01:11:44,050 --> 01:11:47,386
- Zeus!
- Freeze him!

1072
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:50,097
- Hold it, bright eye.
- Huh?

1073
01:11:50,223 --> 01:11:53,225
I have a special job for you,
my optic friend.

1074
01:12:00,776 --> 01:12:03,928
- Huh? Huh?
- Destroy Zeus!

1075
01:12:04,696 --> 01:12:07,906
Oh, we're in trouble!
Oh, big trouble! I gotta...

1076
01:12:08,491 --> 01:12:10,909
My lord and lady,
the Titans have escaped,

1077
01:12:10,994 --> 01:12:12,995
and they're practically at our gates!

1078
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:17,165
Sound the alarm!
Launch an immediate counterattack!

1079
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:19,793
- Go! Go!
- Gone, babe.

1080
01:12:23,927 --> 01:12:26,102
Huh?

1081
01:12:29,137 --> 01:12:30,637
Charge!

1082
01:12:31,514 --> 01:12:33,640
On to battle!

1083
01:12:44,944 --> 01:12:46,987
You windbag!

1084
01:12:48,957 --> 01:12:50,434
Boom, badda-boom!
Boom, boom!

1085
01:12:50,857 --> 01:12:51,727
Ha!

1086
01:12:54,954 --> 01:12:58,457
Hercules!

1087
01:12:58,833 --> 01:13:01,710
Where are you?

1088
01:13:03,796 --> 01:13:06,048
What can we do?

1089
01:13:06,132 --> 01:13:09,342
- Where is Hercules?
- Yeah, Hercules'll save us.

1090
01:13:10,427 --> 01:13:13,388
Hercules!

1091
01:13:13,473 --> 01:13:18,143
Come out! Face me!

1092
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:22,773
Oh, what are you doing?
Without your strength, you'll be killed.

1093
01:13:23,316 --> 01:13:25,400
- Hercules!
- There are worse things.

1094
01:13:25,485 --> 01:13:26,735
Run!

1095
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:29,072
Wait! Stop!

1096
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:33,116
- Hey, look! It's Hercules.
- Thank the gods!

1097
01:13:33,201 --> 01:13:36,161
- We're saved!
- So...

1098
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:39,289
You mighty Hercules.

1099
01:13:47,534 --> 01:13:49,742
- Oh!
- Oh!

1100
01:13:51,886 --> 01:13:54,262
Easy, horsefeathers.

1101
01:13:54,847 --> 01:13:56,765
Stop twitching.

1102
01:13:56,849 --> 01:14:00,060
Listen. Hercules is in trouble.

1103
01:14:00,812 --> 01:14:01,937
We've gotta find Phil.

1104
01:14:02,021 --> 01:14:04,523
He's the only one
who can talk some sense into him.

1105
01:14:09,070 --> 01:14:11,446
Get back, blast you!

1106
01:14:16,119 --> 01:14:18,995
- Ooh! Chihuahua!
- Zeus!

1107
01:14:20,998 --> 01:14:24,251
Come on! Hurry up!
We're shovin' off here!

1108
01:14:24,377 --> 01:14:25,877
Phil!

1109
01:14:26,045 --> 01:14:28,171
Phil, Hercules needs your help!

1110
01:14:28,256 --> 01:14:30,924
What does he need me for
when he's got friends like you?

1111
01:14:31,008 --> 01:14:35,554
- He won't listen to me.
- Good! He's finally learned something.

1112
01:14:35,638 --> 01:14:38,890
Look, I know what I did was wrong,
but this isn't about me.

1113
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:43,270
It's about him.
If you don't help him now, Phil, he'll die.

1114
01:14:43,396 --> 01:14:45,689
I need more thunderbolts!

1115
01:14:45,773 --> 01:14:48,275
Uh, Hephaestus has been captured,
my lord.

1116
01:14:48,359 --> 01:14:50,735
Everyone's been captured.
I've been captured!

1117
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:52,779
Hey, hey! Watch the glasses.

1118
01:14:59,078 --> 01:15:01,997
Zeusy, I'm home!

1119
01:15:02,081 --> 01:15:05,917
Hades. You're behind this!

1120
01:15:06,002 --> 01:15:07,919
You are correct, sir!

1121
01:15:12,383 --> 01:15:14,259
Flea.

1122
01:15:18,806 --> 01:15:21,725
- Hercules!
- Phil.

1123
01:15:21,809 --> 01:15:23,810
Come on, kid. Come on. Fight back.

1124
01:15:23,936 --> 01:15:26,980
Come on, you can take this bum.
This guy's a pushover. Look at him.

1125
01:15:27,064 --> 01:15:29,107
You were right all along, Phil.

1126
01:15:30,318 --> 01:15:32,194
Dreams are for rookies.

1127
01:15:32,278 --> 01:15:35,530
No, no, no, no, kid.
Givin' up is for rookies.

1128
01:15:35,615 --> 01:15:37,657
I came back
'cause I'm not quittin' on ya.

1129
01:15:37,742 --> 01:15:39,951
I'm willing to go the distance.

1130
01:15:40,036 --> 01:15:41,786
How 'bout you?

1131
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:47,542
Me bite off head!

1132
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:53,632
Whoa, baby!

1133
01:16:07,188 --> 01:16:09,481
Hercules! Look out!

1134
01:16:09,607 --> 01:16:12,400
Meg! No!

1135
01:16:21,369 --> 01:16:23,119
What's happening?

1136
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:27,666
H-Hades' deal is broken.

1137
01:16:28,834 --> 01:16:31,002
He promised I wouldn't get hurt.

1138
01:16:31,754 --> 01:16:33,505
Meg.

1139
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:36,383
Why... why... why did ya...

1140
01:16:36,467 --> 01:16:37,759
You didn't have to...

1141
01:16:37,843 --> 01:16:43,014
Oh, people always do crazy things
when they're in love.

1142
01:16:44,934 --> 01:16:46,184
Oh, Meg.

1143
01:16:46,310 --> 01:16:48,353
Meg, I... I...

1144
01:16:48,854 --> 01:16:52,315
Are you always this articulate?

1145
01:16:55,569 --> 01:16:59,447
You... You haven't got much time.
You can still stop Hades.

1146
01:17:00,574 --> 01:17:03,076
I'll watch over her, kid.

1147
01:17:03,953 --> 01:17:05,912
You're gonna be all right.

1148
01:17:06,247 --> 01:17:08,206
I promise.

1149
01:17:10,668 --> 01:17:12,544
Let's go, Pegasus!

1150
01:17:15,006 --> 01:17:17,966
Hup, two, three, four.
Come on, everybody!

1151
01:17:18,134 --> 01:17:20,093
I can't hear you!

1152
01:17:20,803 --> 01:17:24,973
I swear to you, Hades,
when I get out of this...

1153
01:17:25,057 --> 01:17:27,976
I'm the one giving orders now, bolt boy.

1154
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:30,478
And I think I'm gonna like it here.

1155
01:17:30,563 --> 01:17:33,356
Don't get too comfortable, Hades!

1156
01:17:35,026 --> 01:17:36,484
Hercules!

1157
01:17:36,569 --> 01:17:38,903
This ought to even the odds!

1158
01:17:41,574 --> 01:17:44,159
Yeah, Hercules! Thank you, man.

1159
01:17:44,243 --> 01:17:45,577
Get them!

1160
01:17:48,164 --> 01:17:49,306
Whoa! Hey!

1161
01:17:50,291 --> 01:17:54,461
No! Get him! Not me! Him!

1162
01:17:56,255 --> 01:18:00,759
Follow the fingers! Him!
The yutz with the horse.

1163
01:18:07,641 --> 01:18:09,476
Thank you, my boy.

1164
01:18:09,643 --> 01:18:14,314
Nice horsey! My intentions were pure!
I really was attracted to you.

1165
01:18:17,318 --> 01:18:18,693
Throw!

1166
01:18:18,727 --> 01:18:23,031
Ah! Now watch your old man work!

1167
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:32,916
Guys, get your titanic rears in gear
and kick some Olympian butt!

1168
01:18:33,709 --> 01:18:35,460
Whoa! Is my hair out?

1169
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:04,531
Thanks a ton, Wonderboy.

1170
01:19:04,615 --> 01:19:07,409
But at least
I've got one swell consolation prize,

1171
01:19:07,493 --> 01:19:11,246
a friend of yours who's dying to see me.

1172
01:19:12,164 --> 01:19:13,636
Meg.

1173
01:19:40,164 --> 01:19:41,636
Ha! Meg.

1174
01:19:43,164 --> 01:19:44,636
Meg.

1175
01:19:51,412 --> 01:19:53,204
Meg, no.

1176
01:20:13,392 --> 01:20:15,560
Oh, I'm sorry, kid.

1177
01:20:18,355 --> 01:20:21,232
There's some things
you just can't change.

1178
01:20:23,777 --> 01:20:25,653
Yes, I can.

1179
01:20:29,450 --> 01:20:31,826
We were so close!

1180
01:20:31,911 --> 01:20:33,411
So close.

1181
01:20:33,496 --> 01:20:35,371
We tripped at the finish line. Why?

1182
01:20:35,456 --> 01:20:39,417
Because our little nut, Meg,
has to go all noble.

1183
01:20:43,797 --> 01:20:46,508
- Where's Meg?
- Look who's here.

1184
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:48,801
Wonderboy, you are too much.

1185
01:20:48,886 --> 01:20:52,722
- Let her go.
- Get a grip.

1186
01:20:52,806 --> 01:20:54,933
Come here, come here.
Let me show you around.

1187
01:20:55,935 --> 01:20:59,437
Hmph. Well, well.
It's a small underworld after all. Huh?

1188
01:21:00,523 --> 01:21:02,482
Meg!

1189
01:21:02,566 --> 01:21:04,359
No, no, no. Mustn't touch.

1190
01:21:04,443 --> 01:21:06,986
You see, Meg's
running with a new crowd these days.

1191
01:21:07,112 --> 01:21:08,947
And not a very lively one, at that.

1192
01:21:10,783 --> 01:21:14,035
You like making deals.
Take me in Meg's place.

1193
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:19,707
Oh, hmph, well. The son of my hated rival
trapped forever in a river of death.

1194
01:21:19,792 --> 01:21:22,210
- Going once.
- Hmm? Is there a downside to this?

1195
01:21:22,294 --> 01:21:25,380
- Going twice!
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1196
01:21:25,464 --> 01:21:28,925
You get her out. She goes, you stay.

1197
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:33,471
Oh, you what slipped my mind?

1198
01:21:33,556 --> 01:21:35,431
You'll be dead
before you can get to her.

1199
01:21:35,516 --> 01:21:37,100
That's not a problem, is it?

1200
01:22:03,639 --> 01:22:04,454
Oh!

1201
01:22:05,504 --> 01:22:07,922
What's the matter
with these scissors?

1202
01:22:08,007 --> 01:22:10,508
The thread won't cut.

1203
01:22:18,058 --> 01:22:20,768
This is... This is impossible!

1204
01:22:20,853 --> 01:22:23,771
You... You... You can't be alive.
You'd have to be a, a...

1205
01:22:23,856 --> 01:22:25,273
- A god?
- A god?

1206
01:22:29,945 --> 01:22:33,656
Hercules, stop!
You can't do this to me. You can't...

1207
01:22:33,741 --> 01:22:36,034
Fine. Okay. Listen.

1208
01:22:36,118 --> 01:22:39,120
Okay. Well, I deserved that.
Herc, Herc, Herc. Can we talk?

1209
01:22:39,204 --> 01:22:41,122
Y-Your dad? He's a fun guy, right?

1210
01:22:41,206 --> 01:22:43,416
So maybe you could
put in a word with him,

1211
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,793
and he'd kinda blow this
whole thing off, you know?

1212
01:22:45,878 --> 01:22:48,463
Meg, Meg, talk to him.
You know, a little schmooze, uh...

1213
01:22:51,592 --> 01:22:56,304
Get away from me! Don't touch me!
Get your slimy souls off me!

1214
01:22:57,348 --> 01:22:59,891
He's not gonna be happy
when he gets outta there.

1215
01:22:59,975 --> 01:23:02,852
- You mean, if he gets outta there.
- Taxi!

1216
01:23:02,936 --> 01:23:04,896
- If. If is good.
- Taxi!

1217
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:07,231
I don't feel so good.
I-I feel a little...

1218
01:23:31,757 --> 01:23:34,676
Wonderboy, what...

1219
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:36,302
Why did you...

1220
01:23:36,929 --> 01:23:40,014
People always do crazy things

1221
01:23:40,099 --> 01:23:41,599
when they're in love.

1222
01:23:50,776 --> 01:23:52,276
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1223
01:24:04,289 --> 01:24:06,749
Three cheers for the mighty Hercules!

1224
01:24:06,834 --> 01:24:09,377
Oh, yeah! Flowers for everybody! Oh!

1225
01:24:23,308 --> 01:24:27,311
Hercules, we're so proud of you.

1226
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:29,731
Mother.

1227
01:24:32,151 --> 01:24:35,570
Fine work, my boy! You've done it!

1228
01:24:35,654 --> 01:24:38,072
You're a true hero.

1229
01:24:38,157 --> 01:24:42,368
You were willing to give your life
to rescue this young woman.

1230
01:24:42,453 --> 01:24:46,205
For a true hero isn't measured
by the size of his strength,

1231
01:24:46,290 --> 01:24:49,250
but by the strength of his heart.

1232
01:24:50,002 --> 01:24:54,255
Now, at last, my son,

1233
01:24:54,923 --> 01:24:57,633
you can come home.

1234
01:25:11,064 --> 01:25:15,318
Congratulations, Wonderboy.
You'll make one heck of a god.

1235
01:25:23,368 --> 01:25:27,747
Father, this is the moment
I've always dreamed of.

1236
01:25:28,707 --> 01:25:30,041
But...

1237
01:25:32,044 --> 01:25:36,756
A life without Meg,
even an immortal life,

1238
01:25:37,049 --> 01:25:39,884
would be empty.

1239
01:25:41,553 --> 01:25:42,762
I...

1240
01:25:44,139 --> 01:25:46,641
I wish to stay on Earth with her.

1241
01:25:46,725 --> 01:25:49,101
I finally know where I belong.

1242
01:26:03,408 --> 01:26:05,201
Hit it, ladies!

1260
01:32:56,154 --> 01:32:58,405
It's like I'm...
What am I, an echo or something?

1261
01:32:58,490 --> 01:33:03,911
Hello? Hello? Am I talking to, what?

1262
01:33:03,995 --> 01:33:05,371
Nobody listens.
