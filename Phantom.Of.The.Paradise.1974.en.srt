1
00:00:14,258 --> 00:00:18,208
Swan. He has no other name.

2
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:23,542
His past is a mystery,
but his work is already a legend.

3
00:00:24,667 --> 00:00:28,875
He wrote and produced
his first gold record at 14.

4
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:32,333
Since then, he's won so many...

5
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:36,292
...that he tried to deposit them
in Fort Knox.

6
00:00:36,542 --> 00:00:41,917
He brought the blues to Britain.
He brought Liverpool to America.

7
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:47,583
He brought folk and rock together.
His band, the Juicy Fruits...

8
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:52,583
...single-handedly gave birth
to the nostalgia wave in the '70s.

9
00:00:53,542 --> 00:00:57,167
Now he's looking for the new sound
of the spheres...

10
00:00:57,417 --> 00:01:01,917
...to inaugurate his own Xanadu,
his own Disneyland...

11
00:01:02,167 --> 00:01:06,292
...the Paradise,
the ultimate rock palace.

12
00:01:08,292 --> 00:01:13,625
This film is the story
of that search, of that sound...

13
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:17,667
...of the man who made it,
the girl who sang it...

14
00:01:17,917 --> 00:01:20,208
...and the monster who stole it.

15
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,833
It seems like yesterday
I found Annette in that church choir.

16
00:05:19,042 --> 00:05:23,750
I got her singing lessons, taught her
how to dress, got her first gig.

17
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:27,792
I paid off a columnist.
He did a beautiful story on her.

18
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,750
I told her who to be nice to, who to...

19
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:35,583
I fed her drugs to get through
the tours, made her record a hit.

20
00:05:35,792 --> 00:05:39,083
Then you made her
the biggest thing in rock.

21
00:05:39,292 --> 00:05:43,833
So now what does she do?
She fires us, cancels Vegas...

22
00:05:44,042 --> 00:05:47,208
...and gives free concerts
for gook orphans.

23
00:05:47,417 --> 00:05:51,458
She was more than a piece.
She was the light of my life.

24
00:05:51,667 --> 00:05:53,375
And now she's gone.

25
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:57,542
There'll be a 20-minute intermission
before the next show.

26
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:02,208
We sued her. We couldn't lose.
We had an ironclad contract.

27
00:06:02,417 --> 00:06:07,542
It was a lock, it was over, it was
closed. I even bribed the judge.

28
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:12,125
He said we couldn't sign anyone
to a life contract.

29
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:16,042
Called us a disgrace
to the profession. A disgrace.

30
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:20,917
I made her the moneygrubbing
whore she was, and I'm a disgrace?

31
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:24,625
- What do you want me to do?
- Break her.

32
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,542
- Is that all?
- Isn't that enough?

33
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,708
Annette is nothing,
finished, washed up.

34
00:06:30,917 --> 00:06:34,708
- She's at the top of the charts.
- That's today, Philbin.

35
00:06:34,917 --> 00:06:39,917
Tomorrow she'll be forgotten.
We have more important business.

36
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:43,625
- The Paradise.
- I know. We've looked everywhere...

37
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:44,875
Listen.

38
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:48,375
What?

39
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:15,708
That's it.
The music to open the Paradise.

40
00:08:15,917 --> 00:08:21,292
- I've finally found it.
- That creep to open the Paradise?

41
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:26,083
No, not him. The music.
Listen to the music.

42
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:29,417
What do I do with him?

43
00:08:30,667 --> 00:08:32,750
You'll think of something.

44
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,042
- Mr. Leach?
- Hello.

45
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,500
My name's Arnold Philbin.

46
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:56,042
I scout talent for Swan.
He's interested in your stuff.

47
00:09:56,292 --> 00:09:58,042
- The Swan?
- That's right.

48
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,042
- He said your song could be big.
- Really?

49
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,500
I was right there.

50
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:06,167
If he produced my music,
the world would listen.

51
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:10,750
The game plan exactly,
but you need a lot of work, polishing.

52
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:13,792
I know. I have a long way to go.

53
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,417
- Do you have any tapes of your stuff?
- No, but it's all written down here.

54
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:24,708
- Give us two or three good up numbers.
- Two or three?

55
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:29,458
This cantata is 200 or 300 pages,
and I haven't finished yet.

56
00:10:29,667 --> 00:10:32,958
Forget the sonata.
We just want the songs.

57
00:10:33,167 --> 00:10:37,250
- It's not just songs. It's much more.
- I don't get you.

58
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:42,417
It's a whole series of songs
that tell a story of Faust.

59
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:47,833
- Who? What label's he on?
- He was a legendary German magician.

60
00:10:48,042 --> 00:10:51,792
He sold his soul to the devil
for worldly power.

61
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,708
What is this, kid? School time?

62
00:10:54,917 --> 00:10:59,000
A song is a song.
You either dig it, or you don't.

63
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:04,042
Now, I like your stuff, kid.
It's terrific. And you know what?

64
00:11:04,292 --> 00:11:07,417
I think the Juicy Fruits will dig it.

65
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,500
I'm not promising anything. First...

66
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:14,583
I won't let my music be mutilated
by those greaseballs!

67
00:11:14,792 --> 00:11:17,833
- Only I can sing Faust!
- It was just an idea.

68
00:11:18,042 --> 00:11:21,083
Swan makes all these decisions,
you know?

69
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:28,375
I'm sorry. It's just that
I worked so hard on this thing.

70
00:11:28,792 --> 00:11:33,333
- It's okay. You sure got a temper.
- I'm sorry.

71
00:11:33,542 --> 00:11:38,042
- I don't know what comes over me.
- Just relax. Take it easy.

72
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:42,958
Give me the music. Swan will take
a look and get right back to you.

73
00:11:43,542 --> 00:11:48,250
But if you ask me, I think
we're gonna produce your first album.

74
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:49,458
Really?

75
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:22,583
- Hello. I'm Winslow Leach.
- Yes?

76
00:12:22,792 --> 00:12:27,375
Mr. Philbin said Mr. Swan would call
about producing my record.

77
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:31,375
He said he'd get back to me.
That was a month ago.

78
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,583
One moment, please.

79
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:02,542
Taxi! Taxi! Taxi!

80
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:06,708
Follow that car.

81
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:54,833
- Where did you get that song?
- From Philbin, to audition with.

82
00:14:55,042 --> 00:14:57,417
- Sing it again.
- Why?

83
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,417
Go ahead. Sing it.

84
00:15:37,667 --> 00:15:41,875
That's incredible.
How'd you know it went like that?

85
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:46,792
- I wrote the song.
- Then why aren't you with Swan?

86
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,625
- There must be some mix-up.
- Oh, sure.

87
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:53,083
Your name's not on the music.

88
00:15:53,292 --> 00:15:58,250
Swan heard me sing this. Why's he
auditioning girls for my cantata?

89
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,208
- I only sing it solo.
- Haven't you heard?

90
00:16:01,417 --> 00:16:04,917
- He's opening the Paradise with it.
- You're kidding.

91
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:08,250
- I look like a kidder?
- He's using my cantata?

92
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:11,542
- Isn't that great?
- I wish he'd told me.

93
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:15,167
He's just auditioning girls
for a backup chorus.

94
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:19,000
You're a fine singer.
You shouldn't be in a chorus.

95
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:21,917
I don't care where I sing this music.

96
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:26,167
Hey, look. Could you help me?

97
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:29,417
I can sing these songs
better than anybody.

98
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:32,625
With your help,
I can get in the chorus.

99
00:16:33,042 --> 00:16:37,125
- I'd love to help you.
- You're not just being nice?

100
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:41,292
Personal desire never influences
my aesthetic judgment.

101
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:45,708
- What's that mean?
- It means I think you're terrific.

102
00:16:45,917 --> 00:16:47,542
Do you?

103
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:01,708
Everybody get in line, gotta
quick it up a bit. Move in quietly.

104
00:17:01,917 --> 00:17:04,667
One, two, three, four...

105
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:08,375
Come on, come on.
Five, six, seven, eight.

106
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:12,833
Wait a minute. Stop.
What's that, a boyfriend?

107
00:17:13,042 --> 00:17:15,042
- I'm the composer.
- Great.

108
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:18,208
- Swan's only seeing girls.
- I must see...

109
00:17:18,417 --> 00:17:22,208
If you wanna see Swan,
call and make an appointment.

110
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,292
- I got thrown out.
- They don't wanna see you.

111
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:29,000
- But I wrote the music.
- Just get out of here!

112
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:34,000
- Winslow, I'll tell him you're here.
- I'll wait for you. Good luck.

113
00:17:57,083 --> 00:18:00,417
Why won't he just let me sing?
It was awful.

114
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:04,583
- What's the matter?
- Philbin tried to... I can't do it.

115
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:09,500
- I came here to sing. Leave me alone.
- Did you tell him who I am?

116
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:13,583
- What's your name?
- Hey! Come here, buddy.

117
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:33,125
- Where's a good department store?
- We'll take you.

118
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:39,000
- When do we get to sing?
- Not much singing happens here.

119
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:42,833
I've been here 12 times,
and I still haven't sung.

120
00:18:43,042 --> 00:18:45,375
- What do you do here?
- You'll see.

121
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:48,875
- Can't you sing on your back?
- I've never tried.

122
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:52,875
If you can sing standing up,
you can sing lying down.

123
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:56,583
- Take your slip off.
- No, I'm saving it for Swan.

124
00:18:56,792 --> 00:19:00,792
- Do it now.
- You're being auditioned right now.

125
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,333
- What?
- The whole place is bugged.

126
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:07,583
- You're kidding.
- No, Swan's watching us right now.

127
00:19:07,792 --> 00:19:10,167
- Come here.
- What are you doing?

128
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:13,375
- He likes to watch us.
- Watch us doing what?

129
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:15,333
- Doing each other.
- Really?

130
00:19:15,542 --> 00:19:18,167
- It turns him on.
- Does he like blondes?

131
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,125
I like blondes.

132
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:23,875
Do you mind?
I hate to bother you, but...

133
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:28,625
That's right, I...
Just hold me close. I just...

134
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:31,250
I need someone to help me
warm my voice up.

135
00:19:34,667 --> 00:19:36,625
Swan!

136
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:41,083
Mr. Swan, you remember me.
I'm Winslow Leach.

137
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:43,375
May we rehearse?

138
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:49,833
Over here, Swan.

139
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:02,208
- Get this fag out of here.
- It's me. Winslow. Don't you remember?

140
00:20:02,417 --> 00:20:05,792
I gave Mr. Philbin a copy
of my cantata, Faust.

141
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,583
You were gonna look at it.
You're auditioning girls for my work.

142
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:16,208
I'm Winslow Leach! I wrote it!
Where are you taking me?

143
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:18,792
Telephone.

144
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:28,625
That's him.

145
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:31,458
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

146
00:20:31,667 --> 00:20:35,875
- Are you some kind of pervert?
- No, sir. I'm...

147
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:41,500
- I'm Winslow Leach, the composer.
- What are you doing outside Swanage?

148
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:46,417
Listen, officers, you gotta help me.
Mr. Swan's got my music.

149
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:51,500
He pretends he doesn't know me.
He had me thrown out and beaten up.

150
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:57,125
- He didn't want to buy what you had.
- He said nothing about buying.

151
00:20:57,458 --> 00:21:00,667
Jack, what's that he got in his purse?

152
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:03,125
I don't know, Joe. Take a look.

153
00:21:03,667 --> 00:21:08,042
- I think I will.
- Mr. Swan said he had it on him.

154
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:10,583
What do you know?

155
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:13,625
Smack, Jack.

156
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:18,042
- You know the penalty for pushing?
- Life!

157
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:22,208
But I'm innocent!
Swan stole my music and framed me!

158
00:21:36,167 --> 00:21:39,208
Welcome to Sing Sing.

159
00:21:39,417 --> 00:21:44,833
We're very fortunate to be included
in the Dental Health Research Program.

160
00:21:45,042 --> 00:21:50,042
This is a volunteer program
funded by the Swan Foundation.

161
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,958
You are all volunteers.

162
00:21:53,167 --> 00:21:55,792
All your teeth will be pulled.

163
00:21:56,375 --> 00:22:01,083
Teeth are a source of infection.
It pays to be on the safe side.

164
00:22:01,292 --> 00:22:02,333
Sir?

165
00:22:02,542 --> 00:22:05,750
Pardon me. I'm not a volunteer.

166
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:10,458
I'm innocent. I don't want you
to take my teeth out.

167
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:15,250
How many men here are innocent?
Raise your hands.

168
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:22,125
All innocent.

169
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,792
Good morning, everyone.

170
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:33,292
Swan can deposit
another golden disk in Fort Knox.

171
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:38,583
The Juicy Fruits on the Death Label
has taken the charts by storm.

172
00:22:39,042 --> 00:22:44,000
Friday night, you can see them
at the grand opening of the Paradise.

173
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:45,917
Swan's rock palace...

174
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:50,125
...is scheduled to open at last
with this dynamite sound.

175
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:55,292
So let's hear it again. The
Juicy Fruits singing Swan's Faust.

176
00:24:25,417 --> 00:24:27,708
Get away from the record press.

177
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:53,458
- Let's move this ladder now.
- What's that?

178
00:25:53,708 --> 00:25:55,917
I shove the tire in his mouth.

179
00:25:56,167 --> 00:25:59,208
Then he really gets mad
at me, you know?

180
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:32,417
This is the last time
we go through it. See Swan?

181
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:37,542
He's listening and watching,
so don't make me look bad again.

182
00:26:43,042 --> 00:26:47,167
All right, let's get going here,
will you, please?

183
00:27:58,042 --> 00:28:02,625
Let's get it going over here.
Get the car over there.

184
00:28:02,875 --> 00:28:05,750
All right, girls.
Just a second, Linda.

185
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,667
You got a very nice body.
We want to see some skin.

186
00:28:10,875 --> 00:28:15,208
- It's cold. It's just a rehearsal.
- You're not paid to be cold.

187
00:28:15,417 --> 00:28:17,958
- Don't touch me.
- You wanna get paid?

188
00:28:18,208 --> 00:28:21,292
- Yeah, I wanna get paid.
- Get back on the car.

189
00:28:21,958 --> 00:28:24,833
Come on, let's move it out of here.

190
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:30,958
We've gotta get some thin girls here.

191
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:34,417
- Where are you going?
- I gotta get out of here.

192
00:28:34,667 --> 00:28:36,667
- What sign are you?
- Leo.

193
00:28:36,917 --> 00:28:39,708
You're okay. I gotta get out of here.

194
00:28:39,917 --> 00:28:44,208
- Come on, I wanna show you something.
- I swear to God.

195
00:28:44,458 --> 00:28:49,583
Do you see Swan up there?
He doesn't show it, but he's thinking:

196
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:52,625
"Why isn't Harold in the car?"

197
00:28:52,833 --> 00:28:58,167
Do you really want me to tell him
that it's not in the stars for you?

198
00:28:58,417 --> 00:29:00,000
I don't feel good.

199
00:29:00,208 --> 00:29:03,417
You'll feel worse
if you don't do what I say.

200
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:07,583
- I hear this ticking.
- Maybe something's loose up there.

201
00:29:07,792 --> 00:29:11,750
- There's something weird here.
- Take one of these.

202
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,750
- I can't take pills...
- Take the pills, swallow. Feel better?

203
00:29:16,958 --> 00:29:19,792
- Yeah, I feel better.
- No more ticking?

204
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,875
Get out there. All right.
Come on, get this car out.

205
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:28,625
Girls, I want big smiles now.
Look at the audience. That's it.

206
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:32,333
Big smiles. Sing the song.

207
00:30:47,708 --> 00:30:52,417
Winslow, good to see you.
I've been looking for you everywhere.

208
00:30:52,625 --> 00:30:55,250
Killing me won't help you.

209
00:30:57,083 --> 00:31:00,667
My God, you're horrible.
Don't rush off.

210
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,292
Look at yourself.

211
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,500
Look at yourself!

212
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:11,917
What's that horrible sound?
Can't you talk?

213
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,875
Look around you, Winslow.

214
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:20,625
You've destroyed your face,
your voice.

215
00:31:20,833 --> 00:31:25,500
Now you're trying to destroy
the Paradise. Haven't we had enough?

216
00:31:25,708 --> 00:31:29,958
I can give you the power to create.
I'll make you somebody.

217
00:31:30,167 --> 00:31:34,917
We'll have to start over,
only this time working together.

218
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:40,542
The time for your sound is now.
People will want to hear your music.

219
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,708
Tomorrow, I'll put a whole new group
together who'll do your songs.

220
00:31:45,958 --> 00:31:50,458
Come to the auditions.
You'll see for yourself. Trust me!

221
00:31:54,292 --> 00:31:55,875
Trust me.

222
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:15,250
Next!

223
00:32:26,417 --> 00:32:29,625
- What's your name, sweetheart?
- Phoenix.

224
00:32:30,833 --> 00:32:34,917
- Let's see what you got.
- Do I get to sing this time?

225
00:32:35,125 --> 00:32:38,750
- You mean you're really a singer?
- Yes, I'm a singer.

226
00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:43,792
Try to forget it. We're not looking for
singers. We're looking for screamers.

227
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,125
I'm not a screamer. I'm a singer.

228
00:32:49,917 --> 00:32:51,708
Phoenix.

229
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,250
Swan here.

230
00:32:56,792 --> 00:33:01,125
- I want you to answer a question.
- Yes?

231
00:33:01,333 --> 00:33:04,208
What would you give me to sing?

232
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,958
Anything you wanted.

233
00:33:08,667 --> 00:33:10,458
Anything?

234
00:33:11,917 --> 00:33:15,708
Would you give me your voice?

235
00:33:15,958 --> 00:33:17,750
Try me.

236
00:35:33,417 --> 00:35:35,083
She's good...

237
00:35:35,375 --> 00:35:37,000
...isn't she?

238
00:35:38,292 --> 00:35:39,542
Then let's talk.

239
00:37:13,917 --> 00:37:15,500
Filters.

240
00:37:23,042 --> 00:37:24,917
Dolbys.

241
00:37:31,208 --> 00:37:33,208
Perfect.

242
00:37:46,375 --> 00:37:50,292
- How's that? Try it.
- Phoenix.

243
00:37:50,875 --> 00:37:52,792
Try it again.

244
00:37:54,833 --> 00:37:56,750
And again.

245
00:37:58,417 --> 00:38:02,875
At least you can talk. Plug yourself
into the console to sing.

246
00:38:03,083 --> 00:38:07,375
- You really think she's that good?
- Too good for you.

247
00:38:08,083 --> 00:38:10,292
I'll hire her anyway.

248
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:14,500
She could be my voice now.

249
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:17,375
Could she? Really?

250
00:38:17,833 --> 00:38:22,833
Stop terrorizing the Paradise
and rewrite your cantata...

251
00:38:23,083 --> 00:38:25,167
...for Phoenix. We'll both win.

252
00:38:25,375 --> 00:38:29,917
You get your cantata sung by
the right singer, I open Paradise.

253
00:38:30,125 --> 00:38:34,292
We can't waste time.
Lock yourself up in here and write.

254
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:38,208
- I could write for her.
- It'll be performed here live.

255
00:38:38,417 --> 00:38:42,458
- Phoenix will star.
- My cantata. For her.

256
00:38:42,667 --> 00:38:45,917
I'll get fantastic musicians.
The hall has...

257
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:49,500
I don't trust you.
You ruined my music before.

258
00:38:49,708 --> 00:38:54,083
Forget about the Juicy Fruits.
Who wants nostalgia anymore?

259
00:38:54,292 --> 00:38:58,042
- I don't trust you.
- No need. Here's a contract.

260
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:01,583
Everything I've said
and more is in it.

261
00:39:01,833 --> 00:39:04,875
- I'll read it.
- At your leisure.

262
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,333
"The party of the first part
gives the party of the second part...

263
00:39:11,542 --> 00:39:15,917
...full power to do with him at their
pleasure, to rule, send, fetch...

264
00:39:16,125 --> 00:39:20,458
...or carry him or his, be it
either body, soul, flesh or blood."

265
00:39:20,667 --> 00:39:25,083
- What does that mean?
- That's a transportation clause.

266
00:39:33,042 --> 00:39:34,667
"All articles...

267
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:39,458
...which are excluded
shall be deemed included."

268
00:39:39,667 --> 00:39:44,667
- What does that mean?
- That's a clause to protect you.

269
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:51,958
Anyway, what difference does it make?
What choice do you have?

270
00:39:57,375 --> 00:40:01,958
I'll rewrite my cantata,
but you'd best play what I write.

271
00:40:03,583 --> 00:40:06,750
Ink isn't worth anything
to me, Winslow.

272
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,625
Now sign.

273
00:40:21,583 --> 00:40:23,208
Excellent.

274
00:40:28,708 --> 00:40:32,167
And now we're in business together.

275
00:40:33,208 --> 00:40:34,875
Forever.

276
00:40:53,292 --> 00:40:57,667
I'll rewrite my cantata,
but you'd best play what I write.

277
00:40:57,875 --> 00:41:01,000
Ink isn't worth anything
to me, Winslow.

278
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:03,208
Now sign.

279
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:08,625
Excellent.

280
00:41:10,583 --> 00:41:13,250
And now we're in business together.

281
00:41:13,458 --> 00:41:14,500
Forever.

282
00:42:27,875 --> 00:42:29,792
Tasty, Winslow, tasty.

283
00:42:43,833 --> 00:42:48,917
- But I thought you liked her, boss.
- I do. She's perfect.

284
00:42:49,125 --> 00:42:53,208
But you know how I abhor perfection
in anyone but myself.

285
00:42:53,417 --> 00:42:55,292
Then Phoenix is out?

286
00:42:55,542 --> 00:42:59,750
No, not out. Just a backup singer.

287
00:42:59,958 --> 00:43:03,583
My cantata needs something
really heavy.

288
00:43:12,833 --> 00:43:13,875
No, no.

289
00:43:20,583 --> 00:43:22,458
Wrong again.

290
00:43:33,625 --> 00:43:35,167
Pretty, but no.

291
00:43:47,417 --> 00:43:49,042
No.

292
00:43:58,083 --> 00:44:00,833
There's something here like...

293
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:27,708
- How come we don't get to take photos?
- They have exclusive rights to him.

294
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:33,000
- Where's he coming in from?
- Transylvania. Swan will go anywhere...

295
00:45:33,958 --> 00:45:36,958
Remember, no pictures of Swan.

296
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:44,500
Gentlemen, I want to tell you
of our latest work. An opera.

297
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:46,667
A kind of pop cantata.

298
00:45:46,875 --> 00:45:50,458
It was written
by the late Winslow Leach.

299
00:45:50,667 --> 00:45:54,750
It is about a young man
who sells his soul to the devil...

300
00:45:54,958 --> 00:46:00,167
...to become a pop star. It'll be
the first rock version of Faust.

301
00:46:00,375 --> 00:46:04,333
We'll be recording
at the Paradise, Friday night.

302
00:46:04,542 --> 00:46:06,458
Live on the Death Label.

303
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:12,375
- Mr. Pizer.
- Who's singing this? The Juicy Fruits?

304
00:46:12,583 --> 00:46:15,917
No. They're a reflection of the past.

305
00:46:16,167 --> 00:46:20,083
Gentlemen, I give you the future:

306
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:22,375
Beef.

307
00:46:49,083 --> 00:46:51,417
Winslow. Good morning.

308
00:46:53,708 --> 00:46:57,833
- What day is it?
- Thursday. Today is Thursday.

309
00:46:59,083 --> 00:47:00,708
Breakfast.

310
00:47:01,875 --> 00:47:03,833
A little pick-me-up.

311
00:47:08,167 --> 00:47:11,042
How's it coming?
Don't mean to rush you.

312
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:14,083
Don't worry. It'll be finished.

313
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:16,542
How's Phoenix?

314
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:20,292
- I can't wait to hear her sing.
- Doing beautifully.

315
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:24,833
Can't wait to meet you, by the way.
Tomorrow's the big night.

316
00:47:25,167 --> 00:47:27,167
Tomorrow night.

317
00:48:02,208 --> 00:48:06,958
You better get a castrato.
This is a little out of my range.

318
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:11,833
- Something bothering you, Beef?
- This was scored for a chick.

319
00:48:12,042 --> 00:48:17,000
- I'm not doing it in drag.
- You sing it better than any bitch.

320
00:48:20,417 --> 00:48:23,458
You don't know
how right you are, Goliath.

321
00:48:23,667 --> 00:48:27,583
Okay, boys, from the bridge. Hit it.

322
00:49:03,542 --> 00:49:07,583
- Who says I can't sing it?
- I like it. Keep working on it.

323
00:49:07,792 --> 00:49:10,708
Drop an octave here,
change a line there.

324
00:49:10,917 --> 00:49:14,667
Make it completely yours.
Let's go.

325
00:49:15,375 --> 00:49:17,167
Far out.

326
00:49:24,333 --> 00:49:26,917
Doesn't that change the whole thing?

327
00:49:27,125 --> 00:49:32,500
You heard him. Make it yours. If it's
good, who cares what it's about?

328
00:49:32,708 --> 00:49:33,750
Is that so?

329
00:49:33,958 --> 00:49:37,000
- Nobody cares what it's about.
- Is that right?

330
00:49:37,208 --> 00:49:40,708
- Who listens to lyrics anyway?
- Dry up, tubbo.

331
00:50:24,083 --> 00:50:26,125
Seal it now.

332
00:50:48,917 --> 00:50:50,833
This creep gets no comps.

333
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:55,500
My music! Swan!

334
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:07,917
- What was that?
- What was what?

335
00:51:08,583 --> 00:51:13,917
I knew I shouldn't screw around
with a dead man's music. This place...

336
00:51:15,292 --> 00:51:16,708
...is possessed.

337
00:51:16,917 --> 00:51:21,208
- What are you talking about?
- Didn't you hear that shriek?

338
00:51:21,417 --> 00:51:26,333
That was something trying to get out
of its premature grave.

339
00:51:26,667 --> 00:51:30,292
Opening night prima donnas.
Look, iron man...

340
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:35,083
...you're uptight. Take a shower.
- My pleasure...

341
00:51:35,667 --> 00:51:37,792
...Bones.

342
00:53:06,625 --> 00:53:11,917
Never sing my music again. Not here,
not anywhere. Do you understand?

343
00:53:12,125 --> 00:53:15,250
Only Phoenix can sing my music.

344
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:18,792
Anyone else that tries, dies.

345
00:53:19,333 --> 00:53:24,333
Let's see your tickets.
Everybody's got to have a ticket.

346
00:53:24,542 --> 00:53:27,833
- Everybody have a ticket. You got one?
- Sure.

347
00:53:28,042 --> 00:53:30,083
Get back in line.

348
00:53:36,417 --> 00:53:39,875
Take care of the rest of the line.
Open the gate.

349
00:53:43,708 --> 00:53:46,958
Where do you think
you're going, Tinkerbell?

350
00:53:47,167 --> 00:53:51,417
- Cincinnati, to see my mother.
- You're gonna miss the show.

351
00:53:51,625 --> 00:53:54,875
- There ain't gonna be no show.
- What?

352
00:53:55,083 --> 00:54:00,125
Listen, Philbin.
There really is a phantom.

353
00:54:00,375 --> 00:54:02,958
He was just in my shower.

354
00:54:03,167 --> 00:54:08,083
He threatened my life. He said
his music is just for Phoenix.

355
00:54:08,292 --> 00:54:10,375
Only she can sing it.

356
00:54:10,583 --> 00:54:14,167
Anyone else who tries, dies.

357
00:54:14,625 --> 00:54:17,458
What the hell are you talking about?

358
00:54:17,667 --> 00:54:22,417
Look, Philbin, I am a professional.

359
00:54:22,667 --> 00:54:26,125
I have been in this business
a long time.

360
00:54:26,333 --> 00:54:30,583
I don't want to do the show.
Not because I got stage fright...

361
00:54:30,792 --> 00:54:35,792
...but because some creature
from beyond doesn't want me to.

362
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,750
- Bullshit! What really happened?
- Can't you feel the vibes?

363
00:54:40,958 --> 00:54:43,333
Bad, sport, real bad.

364
00:54:43,542 --> 00:54:47,333
The karma's so thick,
you need an Aqua Lung to breathe.

365
00:54:47,542 --> 00:54:51,125
- I know what it is.
- Why don't you tell me?

366
00:54:51,333 --> 00:54:55,375
- Speed, that's what it is.
- What do you know about it?

367
00:54:55,583 --> 00:55:00,375
You just pass it out, I take it.
I know drug-real from real-real.

368
00:55:00,583 --> 00:55:04,708
- Do me a favor and take this.
- No, that'll bring me down.

369
00:55:04,917 --> 00:55:08,958
You better come down.
You better get yourself together.

370
00:55:09,167 --> 00:55:13,500
You got a show to do. It's
opening night. Can you still sing?

371
00:55:13,708 --> 00:55:17,625
Sure, I can still sing.
The Phantom! Help!

372
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:11,750
Somebody get a fire extinguisher!

373
01:02:14,542 --> 01:02:19,375
We want Beef! We want Beef!
We want Beef!

374
01:02:36,625 --> 01:02:38,833
Somebody get rid of him.

375
01:02:39,417 --> 01:02:42,625
- Get out there and sing.
- You're crazy.

376
01:02:42,833 --> 01:02:48,125
Someone killed Beef so you could sing.
If you don't, there'll be more bodies.

377
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:22,708
- Is Beef...?
- Dead.

378
01:06:27,042 --> 01:06:32,292
But let's not talk about that.
Let's talk about you.

379
01:06:33,417 --> 01:06:36,958
I like your name.
We won't have to change it.

380
01:06:37,167 --> 01:06:40,000
You're going to be a very big star.

381
01:06:40,208 --> 01:06:43,167
We'll finish the cantata
tomorrow night...

382
01:06:43,417 --> 01:06:46,292
...we'll record,
we'll go on tour and then...

383
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:50,625
There are no words to express
what you're going to become.

384
01:06:52,125 --> 01:06:54,583
I'll do anything you want.

385
01:06:55,250 --> 01:06:57,500
I owe you everything.

386
01:06:58,167 --> 01:07:02,375
- Just give me that crowd again.
- Tomorrow night.

387
01:07:02,583 --> 01:07:06,250
- Tomorrow night, they'll be yours.
- Mine.

388
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:08,542
And all I want...

389
01:07:09,583 --> 01:07:11,667
...is your voice.

390
01:07:12,542 --> 01:07:14,167
Is that all?

391
01:07:16,917 --> 01:07:18,333
No.

392
01:07:19,125 --> 01:07:21,875
We'll go to Swanage and celebrate.

393
01:07:22,333 --> 01:07:24,583
I'll wait for you in the car.

394
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,250
He wouldn't listen to me.

395
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:13,875
- Where is she?
- Have you ever seen such a crowd?

396
01:08:14,083 --> 01:08:18,167
- I never want to see another one.
- They've been entertained.

397
01:08:18,375 --> 01:08:20,500
They never want the show to stop.

398
01:08:20,708 --> 01:08:24,167
The Paradise is more magnificent
than I dreamed.

399
01:08:24,375 --> 01:08:28,125
- How often is a star fried on-stage?
- It's an attraction.

400
01:08:33,167 --> 01:08:37,083
- Don't hurt me.
- I would never hurt you, Phoenix.

401
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:40,000
You know me?

402
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:43,875
I'm Winslow. Remember?

403
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:50,167
- But Winslow is dead.
- No, not quite.

404
01:08:51,125 --> 01:08:54,292
Who are you?
Why do you wear that mask?

405
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:59,083
Because Swan has taken
my voice, my music...

406
01:08:59,292 --> 01:09:04,500
...and given me this. And now he
wants you. But you're all I have left.

407
01:09:04,708 --> 01:09:09,375
No one will sing in this Paradise
again, no one will sing my Faust.

408
01:09:09,583 --> 01:09:14,167
No one but you. Leave this place,
or I'll destroy you too.

409
01:09:14,375 --> 01:09:19,458
Why should I go with you? Don't you
hear them? Why should I give that up?

410
01:09:19,667 --> 01:09:23,667
They want much more now.
More than you could ever give.

411
01:09:23,875 --> 01:09:26,583
- I'll give them whatever they want.
- No!

412
01:09:26,792 --> 01:09:29,083
Get your hands off me!

413
01:09:33,375 --> 01:09:36,083
With that freak, the Paradise is done.

414
01:09:36,292 --> 01:09:40,042
It's beginning.
Tomorrow, Phoenix will finish Faust.

415
01:09:43,625 --> 01:09:45,417
There she is.

416
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,750
- Beef's killer is on the roof.
- Get the police.

417
01:09:58,833 --> 01:10:03,583
Don't think about it. Tonight is
your night. I won't have it ruined.

418
01:10:03,792 --> 01:10:05,625
Swanage.

419
01:13:06,083 --> 01:13:10,875
What a foolish thing to do.
Didn't you read your contract closely?

420
01:13:11,083 --> 01:13:14,417
See where it says
"terms of agreement"?

421
01:13:15,083 --> 01:13:20,500
"This contract terminates with Swan."
No more suicides.

422
01:13:20,792 --> 01:13:25,833
You gave up your right to rest
in peace when you signed the contract.

423
01:13:26,042 --> 01:13:29,458
But if you do find a loophole,
forget it.

424
01:13:29,667 --> 01:13:33,625
That stays sealed as long
as I have the power to bind you.

425
01:13:33,833 --> 01:13:37,083
If I'm destroyed,
that gaping wound opens.

426
01:13:37,292 --> 01:13:41,583
You might say we terminate together.
Now get back to work.

427
01:13:41,792 --> 01:13:47,083
We need new love songs for Phoenix.
If you as much as say boo to anyone...

428
01:13:47,292 --> 01:13:50,208
...you'll never see Phoenix again.

429
01:13:51,042 --> 01:13:53,417
Oh, yes, about the love songs.

430
01:13:54,250 --> 01:13:55,875
- Perhaps a duet?
- Never.

431
01:14:03,583 --> 01:14:05,583
I'm under contract too.

432
01:14:28,375 --> 01:14:31,500
Do we get to shoot pictures
of you tonight?

433
01:14:31,708 --> 01:14:34,458
Is it true you'll wear
a mask on-stage?

434
01:14:34,667 --> 01:14:37,375
How can we shoot you
if you have a mask?

435
01:14:37,667 --> 01:14:39,042
You can't, fools.

436
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:43,333
It was genius, making
the end of the opera a wedding.

437
01:14:44,042 --> 01:14:48,000
Faust, instead of burning in hell,
he gets the girl?

438
01:14:48,208 --> 01:14:50,667
And you will be the priest.

439
01:14:50,917 --> 01:14:54,750
I've never been a priest before.
That's terrific.

440
01:15:41,125 --> 01:15:45,833
Swan, you remember me, don't you?
You do, don't you?

441
01:15:48,458 --> 01:15:52,792
- Do you know him?
- We went steady in high school.

442
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:58,125
- You're old enough to be his mother.
- This was taken 20 years ago.

443
01:15:58,333 --> 01:16:01,292
My God! He doesn't look any different.

444
01:16:01,667 --> 01:16:02,750
Saturday...

445
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:07,708
...November 19, 1953.

446
01:16:07,917 --> 01:16:11,292
Today, I have decided to kill myself.

447
01:16:11,958 --> 01:16:14,958
In being the greatest showman
of my time...

448
01:16:16,417 --> 01:16:19,583
...I'm recording live
for the Swan Archives.

449
01:16:20,917 --> 01:16:22,292
Why?

450
01:16:24,583 --> 01:16:26,250
Simple.

451
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,375
I'm getting old.

452
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
I can't bear...

453
01:16:35,792 --> 01:16:40,833
...to see this beautiful face
ravaged by the forces of time.

454
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:48,333
If I can't be young forever...

455
01:16:48,542 --> 01:16:51,625
...I'd rather end it all. Now.

456
01:16:57,667 --> 01:16:59,542
- Why not?
- What?

457
01:17:00,583 --> 01:17:02,917
Stay young forever.

458
01:17:03,417 --> 01:17:08,667
I'm real. And I'll leave
if you want. But you did call me.

459
01:17:10,417 --> 01:17:12,583
I didn't call anybody.

460
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:16,833
You said you wanted
to be young forever.

461
01:17:17,042 --> 01:17:19,042
Well, here I am.

462
01:17:20,792 --> 01:17:24,083
But I am stoned.

463
01:17:24,292 --> 01:17:25,625
You're not real.

464
01:17:26,667 --> 01:17:30,625
Then it really doesn't matter
what happens, does it?

465
01:17:31,083 --> 01:17:36,500
- What is going to happen?
- For openers, you'll look like me.

466
01:17:36,750 --> 01:17:38,333
Forever.

467
01:17:41,333 --> 01:17:45,625
This is too much. I guess
you're supposed to be the devil?

468
01:17:45,833 --> 01:17:50,292
- I go by many names.
- And you will make me young forever?

469
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:54,083
This image will age in your place.

470
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:58,542
This picture gets old instead of me?

471
01:17:58,792 --> 01:18:03,958
Yes. And you must watch it every day,
just to see how lucky you are.

472
01:18:04,167 --> 01:18:09,458
- I'm crazy about pictures of myself.
- The tape from which it comes...

473
01:18:09,667 --> 01:18:13,125
...must be guarded at all costs.
- Why?

474
01:18:13,333 --> 01:18:16,542
When it goes, you go.

475
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:25,500
- What do I have to do?
- It's all here. Read it carefully.

476
01:18:25,708 --> 01:18:28,750
Then sign at the bottom in blood.

477
01:18:30,292 --> 01:18:35,000
- Blood? My blood?
- Messy, I know.

478
01:18:35,208 --> 01:18:40,417
But it's the only way
I can bind you. Tradition.

479
01:18:41,958 --> 01:18:44,583
What do you have to lose?

480
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:48,125
Nothing.

481
01:18:50,708 --> 01:18:53,750
I was gonna use this on my wrist.

482
01:18:53,958 --> 01:18:56,875
Your soul is damned either way.

483
01:18:57,583 --> 01:18:59,375
What soul?

484
01:19:00,042 --> 01:19:02,083
Don't waste it.

485
01:19:02,583 --> 01:19:04,375
Now sign.

486
01:19:10,292 --> 01:19:13,500
Ink isn't worth anything
to me, Winslow.

487
01:19:13,708 --> 01:19:15,417
Now sign.

488
01:19:26,083 --> 01:19:29,500
Just sign this,
and it will all be legal.

489
01:19:31,375 --> 01:19:33,083
"Till death do us part"?

490
01:19:33,292 --> 01:19:36,958
Mustn't be late for
your own funer... Wedding.

491
01:19:37,167 --> 01:19:40,208
Aren't we rushing things a little?

492
01:19:41,917 --> 01:19:46,625
- Blood!
- Stop wasting it! Sign your name.

493
01:19:46,833 --> 01:19:49,917
P-H-O...

494
01:19:51,375 --> 01:19:55,875
She must be hit when Philbin says:
"Till death do you part."

495
01:19:56,083 --> 01:20:01,125
This may not be my business,
but why kill her here, tonight?

496
01:20:01,333 --> 01:20:06,750
An assassination live on TV,
coast-to-coast? That's entertainment.

497
01:23:10,750 --> 01:23:14,375
When it goes, you go.

498
01:23:53,167 --> 01:23:57,042
Do you, Phoenix, take Swan
for your wedded husband?

499
01:23:57,250 --> 01:24:01,000
From this day forward,
for better, for worse?

500
01:24:01,208 --> 01:24:04,583
- In sickness and in health?
- I do.

501
01:24:04,875 --> 01:24:08,208
Do you, Swan, take Phoenix
for your wedded wife?

502
01:24:08,417 --> 01:24:13,667
From this day forward, for better, for
worse. In sickness and in health...

503
01:24:13,875 --> 01:24:15,417
...till death...

504
01:24:51,917 --> 01:24:55,042
Oh, my God!
What's happened to your face?

505
01:24:55,250 --> 01:24:56,917
Winslow!

506
01:24:57,250 --> 01:24:59,000
I don't understand.

507
01:25:01,542 --> 01:25:05,208
Your voice, remember?
You promised me your voice.

508
01:25:05,417 --> 01:25:08,542
Our contract, remember?

509
01:26:36,417 --> 01:26:37,917
Winslow.
