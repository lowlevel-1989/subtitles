1
00:00:14,458 --> 00:00:18,533
Swan...
He has no other name.

2
00:00:18,534 --> 00:00:21,028
His past is a mystery,

3
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:24,521
But his work
is already a legend.

4
00:00:24,522 --> 00:00:29,012
He wrote and produced
his first gold record at 14.

5
00:00:29,013 --> 00:00:32,507
In the years since then,
he has won so many others...

6
00:00:33,005 --> 00:00:36,498
That he once tried
to deposit them in Fort Knox.

7
00:00:36,499 --> 00:00:38,993
He brought the blues to Britain.

8
00:00:39,493 --> 00:00:41,986
He brought Liverpool to America.

9
00:00:41,987 --> 00:00:45,480
He brought folk and rock
together.

10
00:00:45,481 --> 00:00:47,975
His band, The Juicy fruits,

11
00:00:47,976 --> 00:00:53,464
Single-handedly gave birth to
the nostalgia wave of the '70s.

12
00:00:53,465 --> 00:00:57,457
Now he is looking for
the new sound of the spheres...

13
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:59,951
To inaugurate his own Xanadu,

14
00:00:59,952 --> 00:01:01,948
his own Disneyland,

15
00:01:02,448 --> 00:01:04,443
The Paradise,

16
00:01:04,444 --> 00:01:06,939
the ultimate rock palace.

17
00:01:08,436 --> 00:01:11,928
This film is the story
of that search...

18
00:01:11,929 --> 00:01:13,924
of that sound,

19
00:01:13,925 --> 00:01:17,916
of the man who made it,
the girl who sang it...

20
00:01:17,917 --> 00:01:20,784
and the monster who stole it.

21

♫ Little Eddie Mitty
Born in jersey city ♫

29
00:01:51,128 --> 00:01:53,929
♫ Started singing
When he was five ♫

30
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,930
♫ Never knew his father
And mother didn't bother? ♫

31
00:01:57,431 --> 00:01:59,931
♫ To catch his last name

♫ For love ♫
And now the tragic story.

38
00:02:45,447 --> 00:02:47,947
Eddie's sister, Mary Louise,

39
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:50,947
Needed an operation.

40
00:02:50,948 --> 00:02:55,450
To get the money he would have
to become an overnight sensation.

41
00:02:55,817 --> 00:02:59,451
♫ Eddie believed
The American people...

42
00:02:59,567 --> 00:03:02,951
Had wonderful,
love-giving hearts.

43
00:03:02,952 --> 00:03:06,454
His well-publicized end
he considered would send...

44
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:09,954
his memorial album
to the top of the charts.

45
00:03:10,404 --> 00:03:12,455
♫ And it did!

46
00:03:34,463 --> 00:03:37,963
♫ Good-bye ♫

47
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,963
♫ Good-bye ♫

48
00:03:40,964 --> 00:03:44,466
When a young singer dies
to our shock and surprise...

49
00:03:44,883 --> 00:03:46,966
In a plane crash
or a flashy sports car,

50
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:51,467
He becomes quite well-known
and the kindness he's shown...

51
00:03:51,468 --> 00:03:54,468
has made more than one
postmortem star.

52
00:03:54,469 --> 00:03:57,470
Well, you did it, Eddie.

53
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,471
And though it's hard
to applaud suicide,

54
00:04:00,838 --> 00:04:04,972
you gave all you could give
so your sister could live.

55
00:04:05,172 --> 00:04:08,974
All America's
choked up inside, man.

56
00:04:09,091 --> 00:04:15,475
♫ We'll remember you
Forever, Eddie ♫

57

♫ For love ♫

64
00:05:14,996 --> 00:05:18,996
You know, it just seems like yesterday
I found Annette in that church choir.

65
00:05:18,997 --> 00:05:22,997
I got her singing lessons.
I taught her how to dress.

66
00:05:22,998 --> 00:05:25,499
I got her first club job,
and I paid off a columnist.

67
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,999
He did a beautiful story on her.

68
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,997
I taught her who to be nice to,
who to...

69
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:33,996
I fed her the drugs to get her
through the road tours.

70
00:05:33,997 --> 00:05:37,494
I made her record a hit.
Then I sold her to you.

71
00:05:37,495 --> 00:05:41,492
You made her the biggest thing in rock.
So now what does she do?

72
00:05:41,493 --> 00:05:44,491
She fires us,
cancels her Vegas date...

73
00:05:44,492 --> 00:05:47,490
And wants to give free concerts
for starving gook orphans.

74
00:05:47,989 --> 00:05:51,488
She was more than a piece to me.
She was the light of my life.

75
00:05:51,987 --> 00:05:53,986
And now she's gone.

76
00:05:54,486 --> 00:05:55,985
There will be
a 20-minute intermission...

77
00:05:56,485 --> 00:05:57,984
Before the next show.

78
00:05:58,484 --> 00:06:00,482
We sued her.
We couldn't lose.

79
00:06:00,483 --> 00:06:02,980
We had her
in an ironclad contract.

80
00:06:02,981 --> 00:06:05,480
It was a lock. It was over.
It was closed.

81
00:06:05,481 --> 00:06:07,978
I even bribed the judge.

82
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:12,476
He ruled against us. Said we couldn't
sign anyone to a life contract.

83
00:06:12,477 --> 00:06:16,475
Said we were a disgrace to the profession.
A disgrace, he said!

84
00:06:16,974 --> 00:06:21,471
I was the one that made her the money-grubbing
whore she was, and he calls me a disgrace.

85
00:06:21,472 --> 00:06:23,470
What do you want me to do?

86
00:06:23,471 --> 00:06:25,469
Break her.

87
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,967
Is that all?
Isn't that enough?

88
00:06:27,968 --> 00:06:30,966
Annette is nothing,
finished, washed up.

89
00:06:30,967 --> 00:06:33,466
But she's at the top
of the charts.

90
00:06:33,965 --> 00:06:36,962
That's today, Philbin, today.
Tomorrow she'll be forgotten.

91
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:41,460
Besides, we have more important
business, you and I... the Paradise.

92
00:06:41,461 --> 00:06:44,958
I know, boss. We've looked everywhere.
You just don't seem to...

93
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:46,957
Listen.

94
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:48,957
What?

95
00:06:49,457 --> 00:06:52,450
♫ Out of place as a crying clown
Who could only frown ♫

96
00:06:52,451 --> 00:06:55,949
♫ And the play went on
For hours ♫

97
00:06:59,447 --> 00:07:01,945
♫ And as I lived my role ♫

98
00:07:01,946 --> 00:07:06,443
♫ I swore I'd sell my soul
For one love ♫

99
00:07:06,444 --> 00:07:08,942
♫ Who would stand by me ♫

100
00:07:10,441 --> 00:07:13,439
♫ And give them back
The gift of laughter ♫

101
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,436
♫ Yeah, one love ♫

102
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,935
♫ Who would stand by me ♫

103
00:07:20,935 --> 00:07:24,932
♫ And after makin' love
We'd dream ♫

104
00:07:24,933 --> 00:07:27,432
♫ A bit of style ♫

105
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:33,928
♫ We'd dream
A bunch of friends ♫

106
00:07:35,427 --> 00:07:38,925
♫ Dream each other's smiles ♫

107
00:07:40,924 --> 00:07:45,920
♫ And dream it never ends ♫

108
00:07:45,921 --> 00:07:49,418
♫ I was not myself last night
In the mornin' light ♫

109
00:07:49,419 --> 00:07:52,418
♫ I could see
The change was showin' ♫

110
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:59,912
♫ Like a child who was always poor
Reachin' out for more ♫

111
00:07:59,913 --> 00:08:03,411
♫ I could feel
The hunger growin' ♫

112
00:08:06,909 --> 00:08:09,407
♫ And as I lost control ♫

113
00:08:09,408 --> 00:08:12,405
♫ I swore I'd sell my soul
For one love ♫

114
00:08:12,406 --> 00:08:14,404
That's it.
What?

115
00:08:14,405 --> 00:08:16,403
The music to open the Paradise.

116
00:08:16,404 --> 00:08:19,401
After all these years,
I've finally found it.

117
00:08:19,402 --> 00:08:22,899
You want that creep to open the Paradise?
No, not him.

118
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,897
The music.
Listen to the music.

119
00:08:25,898 --> 00:08:28,897
♫ What do I do with him? ♫

120
00:08:29,397 --> 00:08:31,395
♫ And lay beside me
While we dream ♫

121
00:08:31,396 --> 00:08:33,394
You'll think of something.

122
00:08:33,395 --> 00:08:35,893
♫ A bit of style ♫

123
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:41,390
♫ Dream a bunch of friends ♫

124
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:46,910
♫ Dream each other's smiles ♫

125
00:08:51,527 --> 00:08:56,031
♫ And dream it never ends ♫

126
00:08:56,382 --> 00:09:00,379
♫ All my dreams are lost ♫

127
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:04,377
♫ And I can't sleep ♫

128
00:09:06,376 --> 00:09:11,872
♫ And sleep alone
Could ease my mind ♫

129
00:09:14,272 --> 00:09:18,074
♫ All my tears have dried ♫

130
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,368
♫ And I can't weep ♫

131
00:09:23,366 --> 00:09:25,864
♫ Old emotions ♫

132
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:29,363
♫ May they rest in peace ♫

133
00:09:29,862 --> 00:09:34,359
♫ And dream, dream
A bunch of friends ♫

134
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,358
♫ Rest in peace ♫

135
00:09:37,359 --> 00:09:43,854
♫ And dream, dream
It never ends ♫

136
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:48,351
Mr. Leach?

137
00:09:48,352 --> 00:09:50,851
Hello? Yeah.
My name's Arnold Philbin.

138
00:09:51,351 --> 00:09:54,348
Hello. Look, I scout
talent for Swan,

139
00:09:54,349 --> 00:09:56,347
and, uh, he's interested
in your stuff.

140
00:09:56,348 --> 00:09:58,845
The Swan?
That's right.

141
00:09:58,846 --> 00:10:01,345
He said your sound could be real big.
Did he really say that?

142
00:10:01,511 --> 00:10:04,343
I was sittin' next to him. Oh, if
Mr. Swan would produce my music,

143
00:10:04,843 --> 00:10:06,841
the whole world
would listen to me.

144
00:10:06,842 --> 00:10:10,340
The game plan exactly. But you need
a lot of work, a lot of polishing.

145
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:13,837
Oh, I know, Mr. Philbin.
I-I have a long way to go.

146
00:10:13,838 --> 00:10:16,835
Right. Now, do you have
any tapes of your stuff?

147
00:10:16,836 --> 00:10:19,334
No, but it's all
written down here.

148
00:10:19,335 --> 00:10:22,833
Well, why don't you give us just two or
three of the really good up numbers...

149
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,332
Two or three up numbers?
You don't understand.

150
00:10:25,781 --> 00:10:29,779
The scope of this cantata is 200 or 300
pages long, and I haven't finished yet.

151
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:32,328
Well, never mind the sonata.
We just want the songs.

152
00:10:32,527 --> 00:10:36,274
It's not just songs.
It's more. It's much more.

153
00:10:36,358 --> 00:10:38,323
I don't get you, kid.

154
00:10:38,324 --> 00:10:42,322
Well, it's a whole series of songs
that tell the story of Faust.

155
00:10:42,821 --> 00:10:44,820
Who? What label is he on? Faust.

156
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,318
Faust was a legendary German magician
who sold his soul to the devil...

157
00:10:49,734 --> 00:10:51,815
For worldly experience
and power.

158
00:10:51,816 --> 00:10:54,814
What is this, kid, school time?
I got a plane to catch.

159
00:10:55,064 --> 00:10:59,311
Look, a song is a song.
You either dig it or you don't.

160
00:10:59,312 --> 00:11:02,310
Now, I like your stuff, kid.
I think it's terrific.

161
00:11:02,311 --> 00:11:04,310
You know what?
What?

162
00:11:04,425 --> 00:11:06,309
I think The Juicy Fruits
are gonna dig it.

163
00:11:06,641 --> 00:11:09,806
The Juicy Fruits? I'm not
promising anything. First...

164
00:11:10,306 --> 00:11:13,803
I'm not gonna let my music be
mutilated by those grease-balls!

165
00:11:13,804 --> 00:11:16,303
I'm the only one
that can sing "Faust"!

166
00:11:16,503 --> 00:11:18,301
Relax, kid.
It was just an idea.

167
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:21,667
Swan makes all these
decisions, you know?

168
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:25,297
I'm-I'm sorry. I...

169
00:11:25,298 --> 00:11:27,795
It's just that I've worked
so hard on this thing.

170
00:11:27,796 --> 00:11:29,795
Uh, it's okay, kid.

171
00:11:29,878 --> 00:11:31,794
Boy, you sure got some temper.

172
00:11:32,127 --> 00:11:34,792
I'm sorry. I don't know
what comes over me.

173
00:11:35,042 --> 00:11:39,290
It's all right. Just relax. Take it easy.
Why don't you give me the music,

174
00:11:39,706 --> 00:11:43,237
Swan'll take a look at it on the
plane and we'll get right back to you.

175
00:11:43,321 --> 00:11:48,284
But if you ask me, I think we're
gonna produce your first album.

176
00:11:48,285 --> 00:11:50,284
Really?

177
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,766
Hello.
I'm Winslow Leach.

178
00:12:21,848 --> 00:12:24,265
Yes?
Mr. Philbin said...

179
00:12:24,631 --> 00:12:27,263
Mr. Swan was gonna call me
about producing my first record.

180
00:12:27,762 --> 00:12:30,261
Mr. Philbin said he'd get right back to me.
That was a month ago.

181
00:12:30,711 --> 00:12:32,759
One moment, please.

182
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:02,243
Taxi! Taxi, taxi!

183
00:13:04,741 --> 00:13:06,740
Follow that car.

184
00:13:37,224 --> 00:13:40,222
♫ Never thought
I'd get to meet the devil ♫

185
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:45,302
♫ Never thought I'd meet him
Face to face ♫

186
00:13:46,716 --> 00:13:48,714
♫ Heard he always
Worked alone ♫

187
00:13:48,715 --> 00:13:50,713
♫ And that he seldom wrote
Or used a phone ♫

188
00:13:51,213 --> 00:13:54,211
♫ So I walked right up
To meet him at his place ♫

189
00:14:03,822 --> 00:14:06,703
♫ All my dreams ♫

190
00:14:06,704 --> 00:14:08,703
♫ I can't sleep ♫

191
00:14:09,203 --> 00:14:12,700
♫ All my dreams are lost ♫

192
00:14:37,687 --> 00:14:43,182
♫ Oh-oh-oh
All my tears have dried ♫

193
00:14:43,183 --> 00:14:47,681
♫ And I can't weep ♫

194
00:14:48,181 --> 00:14:51,179
♫ Old emotions ♫
Where'd you get that song?

195
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:54,677
Well, I got it from Philbin,
to audition with.

196
00:14:55,177 --> 00:14:56,676
Sing it again.

197
00:14:57,176 --> 00:14:59,675
Why?
Go ahead, sing it.

198
00:15:01,674 --> 00:15:05,620
♫ All my dreams are lost ♫

199
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:10,167
♫ And I can't sleep ♫

200
00:15:10,168 --> 00:15:16,164
♫ Sleep alone
Could ease my mind ♫

201
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:21,161
♫ All my tears have dried ♫

202
00:15:21,162 --> 00:15:25,159
♫ And I can't weep ♫

203
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,659
♫ Old emotions ♫

204
00:15:28,158 --> 00:15:30,656
♫ May they rest ♫

205
00:15:30,657 --> 00:15:33,155
♫ In peace ♫

206
00:15:33,656 --> 00:15:35,653
♫ And dream ♫

207
00:15:35,654 --> 00:15:39,651
That's incredible.

208
00:15:39,652 --> 00:15:42,650
How'd you know it went like that?
I wrote the song.

209
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,482
If you wrote this stuff,

210
00:15:44,483 --> 00:15:47,647
then why aren't you in there with
Swan auditioning the singers?

211
00:15:47,648 --> 00:15:49,647
I don't know. There must be some mix-up.
Oh, sure.

212
00:15:49,846 --> 00:15:53,144
They must not know who you are.
Your name's not on the music.

213
00:15:53,311 --> 00:15:56,142
Well, that's funny.
Swan heard me sing that song.

214
00:15:56,225 --> 00:15:59,640
Why is he auditioning girls for my cantata?
I only sing it solo.

215
00:15:59,641 --> 00:16:01,639
Haven't you heard?
What?

216
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,637
He's opening the Paradise with it.
You're kidding!

217
00:16:04,638 --> 00:16:08,136
Do I look like a kidder? He's
opening the Paradise with my cantata?

218
00:16:08,469 --> 00:16:11,634
- Yes. Isn't that great?
- Gee, I wish he'd told me.

219
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,134
He's just auditioning girls
for a backup chorus.

220
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:18,634
But you're really a fine singer. You shouldn't
waste your time singing in a chorus.

221
00:16:18,635 --> 00:16:21,634
I don't care
where I sing this music.

222
00:16:21,635 --> 00:16:25,634
Hey, look, could you help me?

223
00:16:25,635 --> 00:16:29,635
I know I can sing these
songs better than anybody.

224
00:16:29,636 --> 00:16:32,636
And with your help, I'm sure I
could get a part in the chorus.

225
00:16:32,802 --> 00:16:37,136
- Sure, I'd love to help you.
- you're not just doing this to be nice, are you?

226
00:16:37,336 --> 00:16:40,136
I would never let my personal desires
influence my aesthetic judgment.

227
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,637
Wh-what's that mean?

228
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:45,637
It means
I think you're terrific.

229
00:16:45,887 --> 00:16:47,887
Do you?

230
00:16:56,638 --> 00:16:59,637
Hey! All right,
let's everybody get in line.

231
00:16:59,638 --> 00:17:02,137
Gotta quick it up a little bit.
Move in quietly.

232
00:17:02,138 --> 00:17:04,639
One, two, three, four!

233
00:17:05,138 --> 00:17:08,638
Come on, come on.
Five, six, seven, eight!

234
00:17:08,639 --> 00:17:11,138
Oh, wait, wait.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

235
00:17:11,139 --> 00:17:14,639
Stop. What's that? A boyfriend?
I'm Winslow Leach, the composer.

236
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,139
That's great. But Swan's
only seeing girls today.

237
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,140
But I have to see him.
Don't give me a hard time.

238
00:17:19,473 --> 00:17:22,140
If you want to see Swan,
call and make an appointment.

239
00:17:22,424 --> 00:17:24,140
I did that,
and they threw me out.

240
00:17:24,641 --> 00:17:27,091
Then they don't want to see you.
But I wrote the music.

241
00:17:27,173 --> 00:17:29,641
Look, why don't you
just get out of here!

242
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:32,141
Winslow, I'll tell him
you're out here.

243
00:17:32,341 --> 00:17:35,141
Okay. I'll wait for you.
Good luck.

244
00:17:56,644 --> 00:17:59,143
Why won't he just let me sing?

245
00:17:59,644 --> 00:18:01,643
That was awful!
What's the matter?

246
00:18:01,644 --> 00:18:05,644
Philbin tried to... I just can't do it.
I came here to sing.

247
00:18:05,645 --> 00:18:08,144
That doesn't sound like an audition.
Leave me alone!

248
00:18:08,645 --> 00:18:11,145
I'm sorry. Did you tell him who I am?
What's your name?

249
00:18:11,645 --> 00:18:13,645
Hey, come here, buddy!

250
00:18:29,647 --> 00:18:32,145
Do you guys know where
a good department store is?

251
00:18:32,146 --> 00:18:34,646
Yeah. We'll take you.
we'll go right now.

252
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:36,646
When do we get to sing?

253
00:18:36,647 --> 00:18:39,647
I don't think much singing
goes on around here.

254
00:18:39,648 --> 00:18:43,647
I've been here 12 times, and I still don't
get to sing. I just get to come back.

255
00:18:43,648 --> 00:18:46,147
What do you do here?
You'll see.

256
00:18:46,148 --> 00:18:49,147
Can't you sing on your back?
I've never tried.

257
00:18:49,148 --> 00:18:52,147
If you can sing standing up,
you can sing lying down.

258
00:18:52,148 --> 00:18:54,649
Oh! Ah! Why don't you
take your slip off?

259
00:18:55,149 --> 00:18:57,148
No, I'm saving it for Swan.

260
00:18:57,149 --> 00:18:59,148
He won't miss anything
if you do it now.

261
00:18:59,149 --> 00:19:02,148
You're being auditioned right now.
What do you mean?

262
00:19:02,149 --> 00:19:04,649
The whole place is bugged.
You're kidding.

263
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:07,649
No. No. Swan's
watching us right now.

264
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:10,149
Come here.
What are you doing?

265
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:13,150
Swan likes to watch us.
Watch us doing what?

266
00:19:13,651 --> 00:19:15,651
Doing each other.
Really?

267
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:18,650
That's how he gets turned on.
Does he like blondes?

268
00:19:18,651 --> 00:19:20,650
I like blondes.

269
00:19:20,651 --> 00:19:23,150
Do you mind?
I hate to bother you,

270
00:19:23,151 --> 00:19:26,652
but, that's right...
Oh, just hold me close.

271
00:19:27,151 --> 00:19:31,152
I just... Oh, I just need someone
to help me warm my voice up.

272
00:19:34,686 --> 00:19:36,486
Swan!
Swan!

273
00:19:36,853 --> 00:19:39,986
Oh, Mr. Swan. You remember me.
I'm Winslow Leach.

274
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,487
Swan!
Swan!

275
00:19:45,986 --> 00:19:47,986
Swan!

276
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:49,986
Over here, Swan.

277
00:19:49,987 --> 00:19:51,987
Swan! Swan!

278
00:19:52,487 --> 00:19:56,986
Oh, Swan! Swan!
Oh, Swan!

279
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:59,988
Get this fag out of here.

280
00:20:00,237 --> 00:20:02,987
Mr. Swan, it's me, Winslow.
Don't you remember?

281
00:20:02,988 --> 00:20:05,987
I gave Mr. Philbin a copy of
my cantata... You know, "Faust".

282
00:20:05,988 --> 00:20:07,988
You were supposed
to look at it and do it.

283
00:20:08,489 --> 00:20:10,988
And you're auditioning
girls for my cantata!

284
00:20:10,989 --> 00:20:12,989
I'm Winslow Leach!
I wrote it!

285
00:20:13,489 --> 00:20:15,988
Hey, where are you going
with me? Hey, Swan!

286
00:20:15,989 --> 00:20:18,988
Oh, Swan.
Telephone.

287
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:25,990
Hey! Hey!

288
00:20:27,491 --> 00:20:29,490
That's him! What do
you think you're doing?

289
00:20:29,491 --> 00:20:32,990
- Nothing.
- What are you, some kind of pervert?

290
00:20:32,991 --> 00:20:38,492
No, sir. I'm, I'm,
I'm Winslow Leach, the composer.

291
00:20:38,858 --> 00:20:41,491
What are you doing
outside the Swanage?

292
00:20:41,492 --> 00:20:44,492
Listen, officers,
you've gotta help me.

293
00:20:44,775 --> 00:20:48,493
Mr. Swan's got my music, and he's
pretending he doesn't know me.

294
00:20:48,992 --> 00:20:51,493
He had me thrown out
of the mansion and beaten up.

295
00:20:51,743 --> 00:20:54,992
Didn't want to buy what
you had to sell, did he?

296
00:20:54,993 --> 00:20:57,492
He-he didn't say anything
about buying anything.

297
00:20:57,493 --> 00:21:00,494
Hey, jack, what's that
he got in his purse?

298
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:03,993
I don't know, Joe.
Why don't you take a look?

299
00:21:03,994 --> 00:21:08,278
- I think I will.
- Mr. Swan said he had it on him.

300
00:21:09,495 --> 00:21:12,994
What do you know.
Smack, Jack.

301
00:21:13,495 --> 00:21:15,994
Do you know what you could get
for pushin' in this state?

302
00:21:15,995 --> 00:21:17,994
Life!

303
00:21:17,995 --> 00:21:22,362
But I'm innocent! Swan
stole my music and framed me!

304
00:21:26,496 --> 00:21:30,612
One, two, three, four!
One, two, three, four!

305
00:21:34,996 --> 00:21:38,996
Welcome to Sing Sing.

306
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:44,996
We are very fortunate to be included here
in the dental health research program.

307
00:21:44,997 --> 00:21:49,997
This is a volunteer program
funded by the Swan foundation.

308
00:21:49,998 --> 00:21:52,997
You are all volunteers.

309
00:21:52,998 --> 00:21:55,948
All your teeth will be pulled.

310
00:21:56,031 --> 00:21:58,499
Teeth are a source of infection,

311
00:21:58,999 --> 00:22:01,498
and it pays
to be on the safe side.

312
00:22:01,499 --> 00:22:05,500
Sir, pardon me?
I'm not a volunteer.

313
00:22:05,999 --> 00:22:09,500
I'm innocent. I don't want
you to take my teeth out.

314
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,500
Oh. How many men here
are innocent?

315
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,501
Raise your hands.

316
00:22:19,501 --> 00:22:23,001
All innocent.

317
00:22:23,201 --> 00:22:25,500
And good morning, everybody.

318
00:22:25,501 --> 00:22:28,501
This is Windy Greg here on WCHT.

319
00:22:28,502 --> 00:22:32,002
Well, Swan has another golden
disc to deposit in Fort Knox.

320
00:22:32,502 --> 00:22:34,502
His fabulous group,
The Juicy Fruits,

321
00:22:35,002 --> 00:22:37,502
On the death label,
has taken the charts by storm.

322
00:22:37,503 --> 00:22:41,502
And get this, kids. Friday night,
you can see The Juicy Fruits live...

323
00:22:41,503 --> 00:22:44,003
At the grand opening
of the Paradise.

324
00:22:44,252 --> 00:22:48,002
That's right. Swan's rock palace
is scheduled to open at last...

325
00:22:48,003 --> 00:22:50,503
and with this dynamite sound.

326
00:22:50,504 --> 00:22:55,453
So let's hear it again. The Juicy
Fruits singing Swan's "Faust".

327
00:22:55,537 --> 00:22:57,504
Never!

328
00:23:09,005 --> 00:23:10,506
Never!

329
00:24:25,512 --> 00:24:27,929
Hey, get away
from that record press!

330
00:25:49,384 --> 00:25:51,383
Okay, let's move this ladder.

331
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:53,468
What's that?

332
00:25:53,884 --> 00:25:56,384
I take the tire and I shove it
right in his mouth.

333
00:25:56,385 --> 00:25:58,884
Then he really
gets mad at me, you know?

334
00:25:58,885 --> 00:26:01,385
Look.

335
00:26:28,388 --> 00:26:31,387
All right, this is the
last time we're gonna go through it.

336
00:26:31,388 --> 00:26:33,887
You see Swan up there?
He's listenin'.

337
00:26:33,888 --> 00:26:36,887
He' watchin' this whole thing,
so don't make me look bad again.

338
00:26:36,888 --> 00:26:40,887
All right, watch the microphones. I
want to see plenty of movement up there.

339
00:26:40,888 --> 00:26:43,388
Harold, you leave her alone.
Put her down!

340
00:26:43,389 --> 00:26:45,889
All right, let's get goin'.

00:35:11,066 --> 00:35:14,566
♫ That you weren't workin'
Just to survive ♫

455
00:35:14,567 --> 00:35:16,566
♫ But you're workin' so hard ♫

456
00:35:16,567 --> 00:35:22,066
♫ That you don't even know
You're alive ♫

457
00:35:22,067 --> 00:35:25,567
♫ Workin' so hard
To be somebody special ♫

458
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:28,664
♫ Not working just to survive ♫

459
00:35:28,665 --> 00:35:31,144
♫ Well, you're special
To me, babe ♫

460
00:35:31,145 --> 00:35:33,067
♫ But what I don't see, babe ♫

461
00:35:33,068 --> 00:35:36,068
♫ Is where we go once we arrive ♫
She's good, isn't she?

462
00:35:36,569 --> 00:35:39,852
♫ Where you go once you arrive ♫
Then let's talk.

463
00:36:04,932 --> 00:36:08,169
♫ I was not myself last night ♫

464
00:36:16,572 --> 00:36:19,572
♫ Out of place as a cryin' clown
Who could only frown ♫

465
00:36:19,573 --> 00:36:23,573
♫ And the play
Went on for hours ♫

466
00:36:28,073 --> 00:36:30,073
♫ And as I lived my role ♫

467
00:36:30,574 --> 00:36:35,073
♫ I swore I'd sell my soul
For one love ♫

468
00:36:35,074 --> 00:36:39,074
♫ Who would stand by me ♫

469
00:36:39,575 --> 00:36:44,073
♫ And give me back
The gift of laughter ♫

470
00:36:44,074 --> 00:36:46,574
♫ One love ♫

471
00:36:46,575 --> 00:36:50,075
♫ Who would stand by me ♫

472
00:36:50,576 --> 00:36:54,075
♫ And after makin' love
We'd dream ♫

473
00:36:54,409 --> 00:36:57,076
♫ A bit of style ♫

474
00:37:00,577 --> 00:37:04,243
♫ Dream a bunch of friends ♫

475
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:08,443
♫ Dream each other's smiles ♫

476
00:37:11,077 --> 00:37:13,578
♫ Dream it never ends ♫

477
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,578
Filters.

478
00:37:15,828 --> 00:37:20,077
♫ I was not myself last night
in the morning light ♫

479
00:37:20,078 --> 00:37:22,579
♫ I could see
the change was showing ♫

480
00:37:22,661 --> 00:37:25,362
Dolbys.

481
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:31,079
♫ Like a child who was
always poor, reaching out for more ♫

482
00:37:31,329 --> 00:37:35,079
- Perfect.
- ♫ I could feel the hunger growing ♫

483
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:40,579
♫ And as I lost control ♫

484
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:43,364
♫ I swore I'd sell my soul... ♫

485
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,581
How's that? Try it.

486
00:37:47,914 --> 00:37:50,530
Phoenix.

487
00:37:50,614 --> 00:37:52,581
Try it again.

488
00:37:53,081 --> 00:37:55,582
- Phoenix.
- And again.

489
00:37:55,914 --> 00:37:58,081
Phoenix.

490
00:37:58,531 --> 00:38:03,081
Well, at least you can talk. You can plug
yourself into the console for singing.

491
00:38:03,082 --> 00:38:05,581
You really think
she's that good?

492
00:38:05,582 --> 00:38:09,616
She's too good for you.
I'll hire her anyway.

493
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:14,082
She could be my voice now.

494
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:17,585
Oh, could she? Really? Yes.

495
00:38:17,952 --> 00:38:19,584
Then let's get down to business.

496
00:38:19,585 --> 00:38:21,586
I want you to stop
terrorizing the Paradise...

497
00:38:22,086 --> 00:38:24,036
And rewrite your cantata...
for Phoenix.

498
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:26,086
That way we both
get what we want.

499
00:38:26,087 --> 00:38:29,088
You get your cantata sung by the
right singer, and I open Paradise.

500
00:38:29,588 --> 00:38:32,088
Rewrite my cantata? We have no
time to waste. Just one week.

501
00:38:32,089 --> 00:38:35,088
You must lock yourself in here
and do nothing but write.

502
00:38:35,089 --> 00:38:39,591
I could write it for her. It will be
performed here live, and Phoenix will star.

503
00:38:39,841 --> 00:38:42,591
My cantata? For her?

504
00:38:42,592 --> 00:38:46,092
I'll get fantastic musicians.
The hall has great acoustics.

505
00:38:46,093 --> 00:38:49,593
I don't trust you, Swan.
You've ruined my music before.

506
00:38:49,594 --> 00:38:52,093
Forget about The Juicy Fruits.

507
00:38:52,094 --> 00:38:54,095
Who wants nostalgia anymore?

508
00:38:54,596 --> 00:38:56,596
I don't trust you.
You don't have to.

509
00:38:57,096 --> 00:39:01,597
Here's a contract. Everything
I've said and more is in it.

510
00:39:01,598 --> 00:39:04,599
I'll read it.
At your leisure.

511
00:39:07,099 --> 00:39:11,100
"Party of the first part gives the party
of the second part and his associates...

512
00:39:11,601 --> 00:39:13,601
"full power to do with him
at their pleasure,

513
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:17,800
"to rule, to send, to fetch
or carry him or his,

514
00:39:17,801 --> 00:39:20,302
be it either body, soul,
flesh, blood or goods."

515
00:39:20,802 --> 00:39:24,803
What does that mean?
That's a transportation clause.

516
00:39:33,305 --> 00:39:35,806
"All art..."

517
00:39:35,807 --> 00:39:38,808
"All articles which are excluded
shall be deemed included."

518
00:39:39,107 --> 00:39:41,307
What does that mean?

519
00:39:41,308 --> 00:39:44,309
That's a clause
to protect you, Winslow.

520
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:49,810
Anyway, what difference
does it make?

521
00:39:49,811 --> 00:39:51,811
What choice do you have?

522
00:39:57,313 --> 00:39:59,312
I'll rewrite my cantata.

523
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:01,814
But you best play what I write.

524
00:40:03,531 --> 00:40:06,815
Ink isn't worth
anything to me, Winslow.

525
00:40:06,816 --> 00:40:08,816
Now sign.

526
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:23,821
Excellent.

527
00:40:28,822 --> 00:40:33,824
And now we're in business.
Together... Forever.

528
00:40:53,329 --> 00:40:57,830
I'll rewrite my cantata,
but you best play what I write.

529
00:40:57,831 --> 00:41:01,331
Ink isn't
worth anything to me, Winslow.

530
00:41:01,332 --> 00:41:03,332
Now sign.

531
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:08,337
Excellent.

532
00:41:10,841 --> 00:41:15,349
Now we're in business.
Together... Forever.

544

I do. She's perfect.

545
00:42:49,515 --> 00:42:53,021
But you know how I abhor
perfection in anyone but myself.

546

Then Phoenix is out?

547

No, not out,
Just a backup singer.

548
00:42:59,533 --> 00:43:04,040

How come they get to shoot Swan and
we don't get to take any pictures?

577
00:45:26,458 --> 00:45:28,962
Because they've got
exclusive rights to his life.

578
00:45:28,963 --> 00:45:32,468
Where's he coming in from? Transylvania.
My boss'll go anywhere for a new sound.

579
00:45:35,307 --> 00:45:38,479
Remember, no pictures of Swan!

580
00:45:40,984 --> 00:45:43,488
Gentlemen, I want to tell you
of our latest work.

581
00:45:43,989 --> 00:45:47,462
It's an opera.
A kind of pop cantata.

582
00:45:47,545 --> 00:45:51,001
It was written
by the late Winslow Leach.

583
00:45:51,002 --> 00:45:55,508
It tells the story of a young man
who sells his soul to the devil...

584
00:45:55,509 --> 00:45:57,513
To become a pop star.

585
00:45:58,014 --> 00:46:01,018
It will be the first
Rock version of Faust.

586
00:46:01,019 --> 00:46:05,025
We'll be recording at
The Paradise, uh, Friday night.

587
00:46:05,026 --> 00:46:07,030
Live on the death label.

588
00:46:07,113 --> 00:46:10,536
- Mr. Preiser.

589
00:46:10,786 --> 00:46:14,041
Yeah, Mr. Swan, who's gonna be
singing this, The Juicy Fruits?

590
00:46:14,042 --> 00:46:17,047
No, no. They're
a reflection of the past.

591
00:46:17,048 --> 00:46:20,053
Gentlemen,
I give you the future.

592
00:46:21,555 --> 00:46:23,058
Beef.

593
00:46:45,932 --> 00:46:47,601
Winslow.

594
00:46:48,603 --> 00:46:50,606
Winslow.
What?

595
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:54,113
- Good morning.
- Hi.

596
00:46:54,613 --> 00:46:58,621
- What day is it?
- Thursday. Today is Thursday.

597
00:46:58,838 --> 00:47:01,625
Breakfast.
Ah.

598
00:47:01,626 --> 00:47:03,629
A pick-me-up.

599
00:47:08,638 --> 00:47:11,644
Uh, how's it coming? I don't
mean to rush you, of course.

600
00:47:12,061 --> 00:47:16,118
Don't worry.
It'll be finished.

601
00:47:16,202 --> 00:47:19,123
How's Phoenix doing?
I can't wait to hear her sing.

602
00:47:19,207 --> 00:47:23,163
Phoenix is doing beautifully.
Can't wait to meet you, by the way.

603
00:47:23,164 --> 00:47:25,668
Tomorrow night's the big night.

604
00:47:25,886 --> 00:47:27,672

608
00:48:08,077 --> 00:48:11,750
- Something bothering you?
- This was scored for a chick!

609
00:48:12,251 --> 00:48:15,256
I'm not doin' it in drag.

610
00:48:15,757 --> 00:48:18,145
You can sing it
better than any bitch.

611
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:23,771
You don't know how right
you are, Goliath.

612
00:48:23,938 --> 00:48:27,778
Okay, boys.
From the bridge. Hit it.

620
00:49:04,476 --> 00:49:08,350
- Who says I can't sing it?
- I like it. Keep working on it.

621
00:49:08,818 --> 00:49:11,356
Drop an octave here,
Change a line there.

622
00:49:11,856 --> 00:49:14,360
Give it a beat.
Make it completely yours.

- Let's go.
- Far out.

Doesn't that
kind of change the whole thing?

625

You heard what he said.
Make it yours.

626
00:49:30,522 --> 00:49:33,894
As long as it sounds good, nobody's
gonna care what it's about.

627
00:49:33,895 --> 00:49:36,900
- Is that so?
- Nobody cares what anything's about.

628
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:39,405
- Is that right?
- Who the hell listens to lyrics anyway?

629
00:49:39,872 --> 00:49:41,992
Dry up, tubbo.

630

Seal it now.

631
00:50:50,029 --> 00:50:52,033

My music! Swan!

633
00:51:05,817 --> 00:51:08,188
- What was that?
- What was what?

634
00:51:08,474 --> 00:51:11,861
Oh, I knew I shouldn't be screwing
around with a dead man's music.

635
00:51:12,133 --> 00:51:16,596
This place is... Possessed.

- What are you talkin' about?

637
00:51:18,111 --> 00:51:21,018
- You tryin' to tell me
you didn't hear that shriek?

638
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:24,440
That was somethin' trying to get
out of its premature grave,

639
00:51:24,441 --> 00:51:26,871
and I don't want
to be here when it does.

640
00:51:26,872 --> 00:51:28,996
Opening night prima donnas.

Listen, Philbin,

He was just in my shower.
He threatened my life.

671

He said his music
is just for Phoenix.

00:54:19,523 --> 00:54:22,525
I am a professional.

677
00:54:22,526 --> 00:54:26,028
I have been in this
business a long time.

678
00:54:26,029 --> 00:54:30,534
Now, if I don't want to do a show,
it's not because I got stage fright.

679
00:54:30,535 --> 00:54:34,538
It's because some creature from
beyond doesn't want me to do the show!

680
00:54:34,539 --> 00:54:38,144
Now, gangway! Bullshit.
Now, how did that really happen?

Can't you feel the vibes

Bad, sport.
Real bad.

Oh, you do, huh?

You wanna know what it is?
Why don't you tell me what it is?

686
00:54:51,785 --> 00:54:55,559
Speed, that's what it is. Speed?
What do you know about it?

687
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:58,062
You just pass the stuff out!

No!
That'll bring me down.

Well, listen, my friend,
you better come down.

756
01:01:18,733 --> 01:01:21,319
♫ Oh ♫

757
01:01:21,652 --> 01:01:25,873
♫ Oh, yeah ♫

758
01:01:27,458 --> 01:01:30,828
♫ Oh, yeah ♫

759
01:01:30,911 --> 01:01:33,331
♫ I'm the evil
That you created ♫

760
01:01:33,414 --> 01:01:35,966
♫ Gettin' horny
And damn frustrated ♫

761
01:01:36,133 --> 01:01:39,419
♫ Each of you must
Stop and try me ♫

762
01:01:39,503 --> 01:01:41,972
♫ All of you
Might satisfy me ♫

763
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:10,999
Somebody get
a fire extinguisher.

764
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:17,497
We want Beef!
We want Beef!

765
01:02:17,830 --> 01:02:22,995
We want Beef!
We want Beef!

766
01:02:35,825 --> 01:02:38,190
Somebody get rid of him.

767
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:41,990
Phoenix, get out there and sing.

768
01:02:42,439 --> 01:02:45,987
You're crazy. Look, some maniac
killed Beef so you could sing.

769
01:02:45,988 --> 01:02:48,855
Don't disappoint him, or else there
will be more bodies out there.

771
01:03:18,479 --> 01:03:22,478

803
01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:33,938
♫ Hello ♫

804
01:06:14,125 --> 01:06:18,124
Phoenix.
Swan.

805
01:06:21,123 --> 01:06:24,122
Is Beef...
Dead.

806
01:06:27,621 --> 01:06:32,120
Let's not talk about that.
Let's talk about you.

807
01:06:33,619 --> 01:06:37,617
I like your name.
We won't have to change it.

808
01:06:37,618 --> 01:06:40,616
You're going to be
a very big star, Phoenix.

809
01:06:40,617 --> 01:06:44,615
We'll finish the cantata tomorrow night.
We'll record. We'll go on tour.

810
01:06:44,616 --> 01:06:46,615
And then...

811
01:06:47,115 --> 01:06:51,114
There are no words to express
what you're going to become.

812
01:06:52,613 --> 01:06:58,112
I'll do anything you want.
I owe you everything.

813
01:06:58,611 --> 01:07:01,110
Just give me that crowd again.

814
01:07:01,111 --> 01:07:05,109
Tomorrow night. Tomorrow
night they'll be yours.

815
01:07:05,110 --> 01:07:07,108
Mine.

816
01:07:07,109 --> 01:07:11,608
And all I want is your voice.

817
01:07:13,108 --> 01:07:15,606
Is that all?

818
01:07:17,106 --> 01:07:22,603
No. We'll go
to Swanage and celebrate.

819
01:07:22,604 --> 01:07:26,103
I'll wait for you in the car.

820
01:07:26,104 --> 01:07:28,603
Phoenix! Phoenix!

821
01:07:57,260 --> 01:07:59,592
Beef, Beef, Beef, Beef!

822
01:08:03,093 --> 01:08:05,092
He wouldn't listen to me.

823
01:08:11,090 --> 01:08:14,588
Where the hell is she? Philbin,
have you ever seen such a crowd?

824
01:08:14,589 --> 01:08:16,587
No, and I never
wanna see another one.

825
01:08:16,588 --> 01:08:18,587
Look at them. They've
really been entertained.

826
01:08:18,588 --> 01:08:21,087
They never want
the show to stop.

827
01:08:21,587 --> 01:08:24,585
The Paradise is more
magnificent than I ever dreamed.

828
01:08:24,586 --> 01:08:28,585
Sure. How often is a rock star
fried on stage? Quite an attraction.

829
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,083
Don't hurt me.

830
01:08:35,299 --> 01:08:37,582
I would never hurt you, Phoenix.

831
01:08:37,715 --> 01:08:40,548
You know me.

832
01:08:40,631 --> 01:08:44,497
I'm Winslow. Remember?

833
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:50,578
But Winslow's dead.
No, not quite.

834
01:08:50,795 --> 01:08:54,577
What do you mean? Who are you?
Why do you wear that mask?

835
01:08:54,911 --> 01:09:00,575
Because Swan's taken my voice,
my music, and given me this!

836
01:09:00,909 --> 01:09:05,073
And now he wants you.
But you're all I have left.

837
01:09:05,074 --> 01:09:07,573
Phoenix, no one will sing
in this Paradise again.

838
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:11,072
No one's ever gonna sing my "Faust" again.
No one but you.

839
01:09:11,073 --> 01:09:14,571
Phoenix, leave this place,
or I will destroy you too.

840
01:09:14,821 --> 01:09:17,070
You're crazy.
Why should I go with you?

841
01:09:17,071 --> 01:09:19,570
Don't you hear them down there?
Why should I give that up?

842
01:09:20,036 --> 01:09:22,068
They want more now.
They want much more.

843
01:09:22,069 --> 01:09:24,069
They want more than
you could ever give.

844
01:09:24,284 --> 01:09:27,068
- I'll give them whatever they want.
- No, Phoenix!

845
01:09:27,201 --> 01:09:29,699
Get your hands off me!

846
01:09:33,815 --> 01:09:36,064
I'm telling you, with that freak on
the loose, the Paradise is finished.

847
01:09:36,065 --> 01:09:40,613
The Paradise is just beginning. Tomorrow
night, Phoenix will finish "Faust".

848
01:09:44,029 --> 01:09:46,062
There she is.

849
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:52,527
The freak that killed Beef
is up on the roof.

850
01:09:52,610 --> 01:09:55,059
Philbin, get the police.

851
01:09:59,224 --> 01:10:04,056
Don't think about it. Tonight is
your night. I won't have it ruined.

852
01:10:04,057 --> 01:10:06,556
Swanage.

♫ Hello ♫

887
01:13:06,466 --> 01:13:08,798
Winslow,
what a foolish thing to do.

888
01:13:08,799 --> 01:13:11,299
Didn't you read
your contract closely?

889
01:13:11,415 --> 01:13:14,797
See where it says "terms of
agreement". Can you read what it says?

890
01:13:14,964 --> 01:13:18,629
"This contract
terminates with Swan."

891
01:13:18,879 --> 01:13:20,795
No more suicides, Winslow.

892
01:13:21,129 --> 01:13:24,793
You gave up your right to rest in
peace when you signed this contract.

893
01:13:24,794 --> 01:13:29,793
What if you do find a loophole? Is
that what you're thinking? Forget it.

894
01:13:29,993 --> 01:13:33,791
That stays sealed only as long
as I have the power to bind you.

895
01:13:33,792 --> 01:13:37,291
If I am destroyed,
that gaping wound opens.

896
01:13:37,574 --> 01:13:41,789
You might say we terminate together.
Now get back to work.

897
01:13:42,123 --> 01:13:44,288
I need a whole bunch
of new love songs for Phoenix.

898
01:13:44,289 --> 01:13:47,288
And if you as much as say "boo"
to anyone at the Paradise,

899
01:13:47,621 --> 01:13:49,287
you'll never see Phoenix again.

900
01:13:49,737 --> 01:13:52,653
- No!
- Oh, yes.

901
01:13:52,736 --> 01:13:55,952
- About the love songs, perhaps a duet.
- Never!

902
01:14:03,566 --> 01:14:06,865
I'm under contract too.

903
01:14:28,276 --> 01:14:31,774
Hey, Swan. Are we gonna get
to shoot pictures of you tonight?

904
01:14:32,275 --> 01:14:34,273
What's this rumor you're
gonna wear a mask on stage?

905
01:14:34,274 --> 01:14:37,772
Hey, how can we shoot you
if you got a mask on, man?

906
01:14:37,773 --> 01:14:42,271
You can't, fools. Philbin, it was genius
making the end of the opera a wedding.

907
01:14:44,271 --> 01:14:47,269
You mean Faust, instead of
burning in hell, he gets the girl?

908
01:14:47,270 --> 01:14:51,268
Yes. And you, Philbin,
will be the priest.

909
01:14:51,269 --> 01:14:55,268
I ain't never been a priest before.
That's terrific.

910
01:15:41,287 --> 01:15:43,752
Swan, you remember me,
don't you?

911
01:15:43,753 --> 01:15:46,752
You do, don't you? Swan!

912
01:15:48,751 --> 01:15:50,750
Do you know him?

913
01:15:50,751 --> 01:15:53,250
Well, we went steady
together in high school.

914
01:15:53,251 --> 01:15:55,250
You're kidding. You're old
enough to be his mother.

915
01:15:55,666 --> 01:15:58,249
This was taken twenty years ago.

916
01:15:58,616 --> 01:16:01,698
My god. He doesn't
look any different.

917
01:16:01,781 --> 01:16:04,247
Saturday November 19th,

918
01:16:04,747 --> 01:16:08,245
1953.

919
01:16:08,246 --> 01:16:11,695
Today I have decided
to kill myself.

920
01:16:11,778 --> 01:16:14,743
And being the greatest
showman of my time,

921
01:16:14,744 --> 01:16:19,243
I'm recording live
for the Swan archives.

922
01:16:21,242 --> 01:16:24,740
Why?

923
01:16:24,741 --> 01:16:29,856
It's simple.
I'm getting old.

924
01:16:32,988 --> 01:16:35,736
I can't bear it.

925
01:16:35,737 --> 01:16:40,736
To see this beautiful face
ravaged by the forces of time.

926
01:16:45,735 --> 01:16:48,234
If I can't be young forever,

927
01:16:48,734 --> 01:16:52,099
I'd rather end it all now.

928
01:16:57,931 --> 01:17:00,730
- Why not?
- What?

929
01:17:00,847 --> 01:17:03,728
Stay young forever.

930
01:17:03,729 --> 01:17:08,728
I'm real, and I'll leave if you want.
But you did call me.

931
01:17:09,144 --> 01:17:12,726
I didn't call anybody.

932
01:17:13,060 --> 01:17:16,725
You said you wanted
to be young forever.

933
01:17:17,226 --> 01:17:19,508
Well, here I am.

934
01:17:21,224 --> 01:17:25,723
But I am stoned.
You're not real.

935
01:17:26,089 --> 01:17:29,721
It really doesn't matter
what happens, does it?

936
01:17:30,088 --> 01:17:32,721
What is going to happen?

937
01:17:33,087 --> 01:17:37,220
For openers, you're going
to look like me forever.

938
01:17:41,218 --> 01:17:43,716
Oh, this is too much.

939
01:17:43,717 --> 01:17:45,717
I guess you're
supposed to be the devil.

940
01:17:45,883 --> 01:17:47,217
I go by many names.

941
01:17:47,633 --> 01:17:50,714
And you will make me
young forever?

942
01:17:50,715 --> 01:17:53,215
This image will age
in your place.

943
01:17:53,465 --> 01:17:58,713
This picture
gets old instead of me?

944
01:17:58,830 --> 01:18:04,212
Yes. And you must watch it every
day just to see how lucky you are.

945
01:18:04,411 --> 01:18:06,211
I'm just crazy
about pictures myself.

946
01:18:06,544 --> 01:18:12,209
And the tape from which the picture
comes must be guarded at all costs.

947
01:18:12,292 --> 01:18:17,041
- Why?
- When it goes, you go.

948
01:18:20,573 --> 01:18:22,706
What do I have to do?

949
01:18:22,955 --> 01:18:25,205
It's all here.
Read it carefully...

950
01:18:25,538 --> 01:18:29,704
And then sign
at the bottom in blood.

951
01:18:30,204 --> 01:18:33,702
Blood? My blood?

952
01:18:34,203 --> 01:18:40,034
Messy, I know. But it's the only
way I can bind you. Tradition.

953
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:46,698
What do you have to lose?

954
01:18:46,699 --> 01:18:50,197
Nothing.

955
01:18:50,198 --> 01:18:53,197
I was gonna
use this on my wrist.

956
01:18:53,447 --> 01:18:56,279
Your soul is damned either way.

957
01:18:57,695 --> 01:19:01,278
- What soul?
- Don't waste it.

958
01:19:02,644 --> 01:19:06,309
Now sign.

959
01:19:10,525 --> 01:19:12,691
Ink isn't worth
anything to me, Winslow.

960
01:19:13,140 --> 01:19:15,024
Now sign.

961
01:19:26,053 --> 01:19:29,686
Just sign this,
and it will all be legal.

962
01:19:29,935 --> 01:19:33,184
Till death do us part?
This is too much.

963
01:19:33,185 --> 01:19:37,184
Come and sign. You don't want to be late
for your own funeral... wedding, do you?

964
01:19:37,384 --> 01:19:41,014
Don't you think we're
rushing things a little? Ow.

965
01:19:41,513 --> 01:19:46,511
Oh, blood. Stop wasting it.
Sign your name.

966
01:19:46,512 --> 01:19:50,044
P-h-o...

967
01:19:50,428 --> 01:19:55,010
Remember. She must be hit just as
Philbin says, "till death do you part".

968
01:19:55,093 --> 01:19:58,507
Wait a minute. This may be
none of my business or anything,

969
01:19:58,508 --> 01:20:01,506
But if you're gonna kill her,
why do it here tonight?

970
01:20:01,507 --> 01:20:05,006
An assassination live
on television coast to coast...

971
01:20:05,007 --> 01:20:07,172
That's entertainment.

972
01:23:10,901 --> 01:23:13,950
When it goes, you go.

973
01:23:13,951 --> 01:23:16,950
Swan, Swan, Swan, Swan!

974
01:23:53,055 --> 01:23:56,938
Do you, Phoenix, take Swan to be your
wedded husband to have and to hold...

975
01:23:57,387 --> 01:23:59,937
from this day forward
for richer, for poorer,

976
01:24:00,187 --> 01:24:04,435
for better, for worse, in
sickness and in health? - I do.

977
01:24:04,885 --> 01:24:08,434
And do you, Swan, take Phoenix
to be your wedded wife...

978
01:24:08,551 --> 01:24:10,934
to have and to hold
from this day forward...

979
01:24:11,266 --> 01:24:14,016
for better, for worse, in sickness
and in health till death...

980
01:24:52,037 --> 01:24:55,387
- Oh, my god. Your face, what's
happened to your face?

981
01:24:55,388 --> 01:24:56,947
- Winslow!

982
01:24:57,253 --> 01:24:59,252
I don't understand.

983
01:25:01,368 --> 01:25:04,918
Your voice, remember?
You promised me your voice.

984
01:25:05,417 --> 01:25:09,283
Our contract, remember?

985
01:26:35,257 --> 01:26:37,506
Winslow.

986
01:26:44,053 --> 01:26:47,052
Winslow.

987
01:27:16,909 --> 01:27:19,542
