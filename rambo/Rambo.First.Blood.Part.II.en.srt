1
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:41,541
Let's keep those hammers working!

2
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,520
Rambo!

3
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:06,315
Let's go.

4
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,798
How are you, Johnny?

5
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:32,675
Good.

6
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,095
That's all.

7
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:41,642
I'm sorry they sent you
to such a hellhole.

8
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,187
I've seen worse.

9
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,272
Yeah, you have, haven't you...

10
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:51,861
I told you that I'd help you
when I could. Are you interested?

11
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:59,660
You can't possibly want
to stay here for another five years.

12
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:10,963
- In here at least I know where I stand.
- Just hear me out first.

13
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:15,092
A covert operation
is being geared up in the Far East.

14
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:20,306
A computer gave your name as one of
3 suitable candidates for the mission.

15
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:24,936
- Mission?
- A hunt for POWs in Vietnam.

16
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,901
Why now? Why me?

17
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:37,114
The prison camp you escaped from in 71
is the target area.

18
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:41,869
No one knows that terrain better
than you. The risk factor's very high.

19
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:45,873
You'd be temporarily reinstated in the
forces, and if the mission's successful,

20
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,709
there may be a presidential pardon.

21
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,421
You interested?

22
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,346
Yeah.

23
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:04,892
Good.
I'll get the necessary clearance.

24
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:10,398
The next time we meet will be in
Thailand with the special ops designate.

25
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:11,983
Yes, sir.

26
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,235
- All clear?
- Yes, sir.

27
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:17,029
I want you to know I did
what I could to keep you out of here.

28
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,156
I know.

29
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,747
Do we get to win this time?

30
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:28,875
This time's up to you.

31
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,511
That'll be all.

32
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:51,475
How're you doing, Rambo? I'm Ericson.
Why don't we make it over to the hangar?

33
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,480
You're the chosen one, ha?

34
00:05:56,898 --> 00:06:00,735
You made
a helluva rep for yourself in 'nam.

35
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:03,237
I'm glad to be working with you.

36
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:07,366
This place may not be heaven,
but at least you're out of the joint.

37
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:13,789
He's here.

38
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:18,794
Morning, John.

39
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:22,423
This is Marshal Murdock.
He's in charge of special operations.

40
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,592
Thank you, Colonel. Rambo,

41
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,262
been looking forward to meeting you.
How was your trip? No problems?

42
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:31,515
Except for the damned heat, right?
I've never felt anything like it.

43
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,351
Come on in,
let's get down to business.

44
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:39,565
I was glancing over your files.

45
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:42,860
Makes pretty interesting reading.

46
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:53,537
Rambo, John J., born 7.6.47, Bowie,
Arizona, of Indian-German descent.

47
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:57,249
That's a helluva combination.
Joined the army 6.8.64,

48
00:06:57,793 --> 00:07:00,586
accepted special forces,
specialization: light weapons.

49
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:03,672
Cross-trained as medic.
Helicopter and language qualified.

50
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:08,719
59 confirmed kills, 2 silver stars,
4 bronze, 4 Purple Hearts,

51
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,554
Medal of Honor.

52
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:17,478
You got around, didn't you?
Incredible. Rambo, you're probably aware

53
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:21,649
that there are almost 2,500 Americans
still missing in action in SE Asia.

54
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:26,529
Most are presumed dead, but for the
families, Congress and many Americans

55
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,031
it's still an emotional issue.

56
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:30,741
Give me something cold, please!

57
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:36,497
Rambo, you certainly don't know
as much about me as I do you.

58
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:40,042
I've honched with the 2nd Battalion,
3rd Marines, in Kon Tum in '66.

59
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:44,004
I lost a lot of good men,
so I know what you and every vet feels.

60
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:48,509
Maybe the government and certain
segments of the population didn't care,

61
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:50,594
but my committee cares.

62
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:54,557
It needs proof
that Americans are there.

63
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,183
Then we'll get 'em back.

64
00:07:56,601 --> 00:08:01,897
If there are any of our men at the POW
target camp, you're to take photos.

65
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,735
- Photos?
- Only photos. Under no circumstances

66
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:11,532
- are you to engage the enemy.
- I'm supposed to leave them there?

67
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,493
I repeat:
do not engage the enemy!

68
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:18,831
The assault team led by Colonel Trautman
will handle the extraction.

69
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:30,134
With your participation,
this mission has a better than average

70
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:32,261
chance of succeeding.

71
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:37,808
I'll meet you both
in the operations center in one hour.

72
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:58,287
From Thailand across Laos
into the mountains of Vietnam.

73
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:02,082
You'll be flying a ceiling
of 250 feet when you bail out.

74
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,127
- Think you can handle it?
- I'll try.

75
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:09,840
Since you're going in solo, you'll have
to take more equipment than ever before.

76
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:14,053
And use it!
Don't try the blood-and-guts routine.

77
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:17,139
Let technology do most of the work.

78
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:22,519
Forget the war. Remember the mission.
The old Vietnam is dead.

79
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:27,107
Sir, I'm alive,
so it's still alive, isn't it?

80
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:40,621
You may find this hard
to believe, but all this is for you.

81
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,414
Impressed?

82
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:47,711
You'll get every modern piece
of equipment we have

83
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,546
to ensure your safety.

84
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:53,425
You can feel totally safe because we
have the world's most advanced weapons.

85
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,305
I've always believed that the mind's
the best weapon.

86
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:00,099
Times change.

87
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:01,850
For some people.

88
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:04,687
Don't let me interrupt.

89
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:07,982
Upon insertion
call in to base camp on Transat.

90
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:11,819
Then proceed to rendezvous
with your ground contact,

91
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:14,029
indigenous agent Co Bao.

92
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:16,198
Is he listening?

93
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:19,326
Indigenous agent Co Bao.

94
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,085
Colonel!

95
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:31,630
Are you sure he's not unbalanced?

96
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:35,384
What if he cracks under the pressure
in that hell?

97
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:36,677
Pressure?

98
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:40,180
Rambo is the best combat vet
I've ever seen.

99
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:45,102
A pure fighting machine with only
a desire to win a war someone else lost.

100
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:50,482
If winning means he has to die,
he'll die. No fear, no regrets.

101
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,028
And one more thing:

102
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:58,115
What you call "hell", he calls home.

103
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,038
Stand by! Start A.P.U.!

104
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:29,855
D minus 20.

105
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:03,389
D minus 5.

106
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:24,535
You've got 36 hours to get in and out.
So don't stop to smell the roses, okay?

107
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:31,458
If you run into trouble, try to get
to the hilltop extraction site.

108
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:38,924
- Good luck, son.
- Thanks.

109
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:40,926
Ready to roll.

110
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:47,850
Murdock said he'd been
with the 2nd Battalion in Kon Tum '66.

111
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,603
The 2nd Battalion was at Kud Sank.

112
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,399
You're the only one that I trust.

113
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:41,737
- Think he'll find someone?
- POWs? Doubtful.

114
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:46,533
But there are people to satisfy,
questions that have to be answered.

115
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:50,329
- You don't sound too emotional about it.
- It wasn't my war, Colonel.

116
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:53,248
I'm here to clean up the mess.

117
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:38,752
K-Wok 2-5 is raft.

118
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,796
They're holding timeline.

119
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:43,382
Affirmative, Wolf Den. Over.

120
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:19,751
We're back in the badlands, my man.

121
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:22,588
Stand by your position!

122
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:26,300
- Insertion in 15 seconds.
- Partytime!

123
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,189
5 seconds.

124
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,543
- What's happening?
- He's hung up!

125
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:06,006
He'll be torn apart!

126
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,218
- He's hung up!
- What do you mean he's hung up?

127
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,970
He's being dragged!

128
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:16,308
- Cut him loose!
- I can't free him!

129
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:41,083
- Abort the mission!
- That'll kill him! He'll be torn apart!

130
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:46,463
He's cutting away his equipment.

131
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,810
He's out!

132
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:04,731
- Here is Dragonfly 1. Do you read me?
- Dragonfly 1, I read you.

133
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:08,443
- Any visual bearing by flares?
- Negative. We didn't see anything.

134
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:20,622
Maybe it's best to abort
the mission now.

135
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,708
Who could survive that?

136
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,584
He deserves the benefit of the doubt.

137
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:29,589
He's got 36 hours to complete the
mission and reach the extraction point.

138
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:32,968
- We owe him that.
- Of course we do.

139
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:38,724
But understand something:
In 36 hours we pull out.

140
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,037
Rambo!

141
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:40,554
You did not expect a woman, no?

142
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:44,558
We'd better go.

143
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:51,898
We go to river.
How come you so late?

144
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:53,900
I was hung up.

145
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:03,910
I have arranged boat to take us
down river. Old ways not safe.

146
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:08,248
You come a long way, Rambo,
to see empty camp.

147
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:02,969
You're using pirates?

148
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:07,098
Best way down river.
Not get army suspicious.

149
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:30,557
What about patrol boats?

150
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:53,121
Russian.

151
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:21,691
Rambo,

152
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,819
want to eat?

153
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,448
Maybe later.

154
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:38,833
How you get into this?

155
00:23:41,212 --> 00:23:44,839
- It's a long story.
- Long trip.

156
00:23:47,802 --> 00:23:51,054
After I left the special forces,

157
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:56,101
- I moved around a lot.
- Why you leave army?

158
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,477
I...

159
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:01,856
... came back to the States

160
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:04,192
and found another war going on.

161
00:24:05,528 --> 00:24:07,237
What war?

162
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:10,406
Kind of like a quiet war.

163
00:24:12,535 --> 00:24:16,830
A war against the soldiers returning.

164
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,373
The kind of war you don't win.

165
00:24:24,547 --> 00:24:27,507
It's my problem.
How did you get into it?

166
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:33,263
My father
worked for intelligence agency.

167
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:37,350
He killed, and I take his place.

168
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:39,894
There's too much death here.

169
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,063
Death everywhere.

170
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,819
I just want to live.

171
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:55,702
Maybe go America.
Live the quiet life.

172
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:01,332
What you want?

173
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:06,129
To win. To survive.

174
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:11,801
Not so easy to survive.
Still war here.

175
00:25:12,303 --> 00:25:16,389
To survive a war,
you've got to become war.

176
00:25:16,557 --> 00:25:19,934
That why they pick you?
Because you like to fight?

177
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:26,983
I am expendable.

178
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:31,404
What mean "expendable"?

179
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:34,908
It's like

180
00:25:35,326 --> 00:25:40,413
someone invites you to a party
and you don't show up,

181
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:43,750
and it doesn't really matter.

182
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:52,091
What's this?

183
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:54,594
It bring me good luck.

184
00:25:57,181 --> 00:25:59,599
What bring you good luck?

185
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,150
I guess this.

186
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:17,283
No further reports.

187
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:19,452
I want to go up
with the extraction team at dawn.

188
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:21,788
- Denied.
- Denied?

189
00:26:21,956 --> 00:26:24,958
- It's an unnecessary risk.
- We have a schedule to keep.

190
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:27,835
- We don't even know if he's alive.
- Unlikely.

191
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,296
You said we'd go through as planned.

192
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:36,511
Okay, if you
want to go through with it, we will.

193
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:38,513
The Colonel's
gonna be joining the extraction team.

194
00:26:41,684 --> 00:26:43,518
You're a damned good man, Trautman.

195
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:43,369
See? Camp empty.

196
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,581
We move closer.

197
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,461
Cyclo-girl whore from village.

198
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,175
Come on!

199
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:58,194
- What is it?
- A bow. No sound.

200
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:09,664
You not going in there.
You're supposed to only take pictures.

201
00:29:10,124 --> 00:29:11,290
What about orders?

202
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:13,709
No more orders, Co.

203
00:32:57,434 --> 00:32:59,018
I've come to get you out.

204
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:02,188
Don't talk.

205
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:34,095
- There are others.
- I'll be back.

206
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:14,779
Everything okay?

207
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:17,198
Let's go!

208
00:35:50,524 --> 00:35:52,316
You have clearance.

209
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:54,860
Minus one hour to extraction.

210
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:58,364
I hope for his sake
we're not just wasting fuel.

211
00:35:58,782 --> 00:36:00,866
Let's get moving.

212
00:36:23,557 --> 00:36:25,266
A good thing you came when you did.

213
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,725
Why is that?

214
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:31,146
They move us around a lot. Because
of the crops. Only been there a week.

215
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:37,069
- When were you last in that camp?
- A year. What year is it, anyway?

216
00:36:37,988 --> 00:36:39,446
1985.

217
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,786
Camp supposed to be empty.

218
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,080
Yes, supposed to be.

219
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:23,908
Landing zone a mile up river.

220
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:27,763
- What has happened?
- We've been sold out.

221
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:30,641
You bastard!

222
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:09,680
- Right, jump!
- I fight!

223
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,473
Jump! Go on!

224
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,697
The gunboat!

225
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:27,800
Jump!

226
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:42,022
You made it, Rambo!

227
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:51,532
Come on.

228
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:18,725
Take this. We go on from here.

229
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:22,563
- Better I stay on to end.
- This is the end.

230
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:25,107
Come on.

231
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:27,651
Rambo!

232
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:31,155
You not expendable.

233
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:56,763
Colonel, 3 minutes.

234
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:10,629
That's Rambo!

235
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:18,637
Christ, he's found one!

236
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:51,295
Rambo's found one of ours!

237
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:57,134
The ground crew has what appears to be
an American POW with him.

238
00:43:58,177 --> 00:44:01,430
- What did you say?
- They've got one of ours.

239
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:05,434
Yellow alert!
Meyers, Harrison, Goddell!

240
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:08,729
Everybody out! Move!

241
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:11,398
Go to your COMINT frequency!
Give me the mike!

242
00:44:14,277 --> 00:44:18,447
Dragonfly, here is Coach 1.
This is a priority order.

243
00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:21,700
Come on!

244
00:44:25,038 --> 00:44:28,540
Abort the operation immediately!

245
00:44:28,708 --> 00:44:32,127
- This is a recall. Confirm. Over.
- Say it again, Coach 1.

246
00:44:32,587 --> 00:44:34,171
Abort the operation!

247
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:39,801
- I've been ordered to abort.
- But we've got them in sight!

248
00:44:39,969 --> 00:44:41,553
Murdock, do you read?

249
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,435
- We're going down.
- You're not going anywhere.

250
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:55,817
You damned mercenaries!
Those are our men down there!

251
00:44:57,070 --> 00:45:00,155
No, your men. Don't be a hero.

252
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:08,413
Colonel!

253
00:45:09,082 --> 00:45:10,248
Down!

254
00:45:51,374 --> 00:45:54,543
What are you doing?
Do you know what the hell you've done?

255
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:57,462
Don't act so innocent, Colonel.

256
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:00,549
You had your suspicions,
which makes you a sort of accessory.

257
00:46:00,967 --> 00:46:03,718
Don't ever
count me with you and your scum!

258
00:46:04,137 --> 00:46:08,390
It was a lie, wasn't it.
Like the whole damned war. It was a lie.

259
00:46:08,808 --> 00:46:10,475
What are you talking about?

260
00:46:10,852 --> 00:46:13,562
That camp was supposed to be empty.

261
00:46:14,564 --> 00:46:19,192
Rambo goes in, finds no POWs,
Congress buys it, case closed.

262
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:24,990
And if he happens to get caught,
nobody knows except you.

263
00:46:25,408 --> 00:46:28,076
Who the hell
do you think you're talking to?

264
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:31,163
A stinking bureaucrat
who's trying to cover his ass.

265
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:34,833
Not just mine. A nation's!

266
00:46:35,001 --> 00:46:39,838
Besides, it was your hero's fault. If
he had done what he was meant to do,

267
00:46:40,006 --> 00:46:44,801
we'd be out of this clean and simple.
He was just supposed to take pictures.

268
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:49,181
And if those pictures showed something,
they'd have been lost.

269
00:46:49,557 --> 00:46:52,517
You still don't understand
what this is all about.

270
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:55,395
Same as always: Money.

271
00:46:55,563 --> 00:46:59,065
In '72 we were supposed to pay the Cong
4.5 billion in war reparation.

272
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:02,068
We reneged, they kept the POWs.

273
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:05,363
And you're doing the same thing
all over again.

274
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:07,282
What would you do?

275
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:12,496
Pay ransom for our men and finance
the war effort against our allies?

276
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:15,540
And if some burnt-out POW
shows up on the 6 o'clock news?

277
00:47:15,708 --> 00:47:20,879
Do you want to start the war over again
and bomb Hanoi?

278
00:47:21,047 --> 00:47:23,965
You think the Senate's

279
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:27,260
going to pay billions
for a few forgotten ghosts?

280
00:47:27,428 --> 00:47:29,804
For men!
Men who fought for their country!

281
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:31,139
That's enough!

282
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:37,312
Trautman, I'm going to forget
this conversation ever took place.

283
00:47:39,148 --> 00:47:42,025
- You bastard!
- And if I were you,

284
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:45,445
I'd not make the mistake
of bringing it up again.

285
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:47,239
You're making the mistake.

286
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:48,865
Yes? What mistake?

287
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:51,660
Rambo.

288
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:54,055
Damned Russian bastards.

289
00:49:18,706 --> 00:49:20,498
He's dead now.

290
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:32,344
Bring him up!

291
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:52,989
The knife!

292
00:49:53,908 --> 00:49:56,701
These people
are so vulgar in their methods!

293
00:49:57,536 --> 00:50:00,163
They lack compassion.

294
00:50:02,792 --> 00:50:06,211
I'm Lieutenant-Colonel Podovski.

295
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:10,215
I do not know who you are yet,

296
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:12,425
but I will.

297
00:50:13,219 --> 00:50:14,511
Take him and clean him up.

298
00:50:49,338 --> 00:50:50,880
That's all.

299
00:50:51,257 --> 00:50:55,176
Thank you, Captain Vinh.
Leave one guard, please.

300
00:50:59,849 --> 00:51:03,143
I see you are no stranger to pain.

301
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:07,063
Perhaps you have been
among my Vietnamese comrades before?

302
00:51:10,109 --> 00:51:11,276
No answer?

303
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:14,863
Do you wish to give your name?

304
00:51:15,364 --> 00:51:18,616
What possible harm can that cause?

305
00:51:21,704 --> 00:51:24,414
Pride is a poor substitute
for intelligence.

306
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:28,626
What you must understand
is that we must interrogate you.

307
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:35,675
For Sergeant Yushin you're a piece
of meat, a laboratory experiment.

308
00:51:35,843 --> 00:51:39,262
But for me you are a comrade,
similar to myself,

309
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:43,141
just opposed by an act of fate.

310
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:47,145
I know you were trying

311
00:51:47,313 --> 00:51:51,691
to facilitate the release
of war criminals. I can appreciate this.

312
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:56,821
But this incident, your capture, is...

313
00:51:58,866 --> 00:52:00,033
... embarrassing.

314
00:52:00,701 --> 00:52:02,535
We must have an explanation.

315
00:52:03,162 --> 00:52:06,122
I want you to radio your HQ

316
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:09,375
and say that
you have been captured and condemned

317
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:11,669
for espionage,

318
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:16,216
and that attempts like these
should not be made in the future,

319
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:20,970
or they
will meet with the same fate as you.

320
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:31,815
Fuck you!

321
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:38,029
You wish to test your strength... Good.

322
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:44,118
Yushin!

323
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:45,889
Comrade, here is something

324
00:53:47,016 --> 00:53:49,601
that might be of interest to you:

325
00:53:50,019 --> 00:53:54,105
a transcript of the conversation
between your helicopter pilot

326
00:53:54,273 --> 00:53:57,609
and his commander that we intercepted.

327
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:03,489
"Dragonfly" and "Wolf's Den"...
Colorful names.

328
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:05,491
Here we are:

329
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:08,244
"We have them in sight".

330
00:54:08,412 --> 00:54:12,916
And the reply:
"Abort the operation immediately."

331
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:18,713
"This is a recall. Confirm. Over."

332
00:54:19,882 --> 00:54:23,635
It seems you were abandoned
by direct command.

333
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:28,890
And these are the people
you protect with your pain!

334
00:54:29,058 --> 00:54:31,351
Increase the voltage.

335
00:54:32,937 --> 00:54:36,689
You may scream. There is no shame.

336
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:10,556
You are strong! Very strong!

337
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:12,517
The strongest so far.

338
00:55:13,352 --> 00:55:16,688
But you're nearly dead. Poor waif.

339
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:19,315
Make the radio call.

340
00:55:45,217 --> 00:55:48,636
To talk, to obey
would be so much easier.

341
00:56:03,235 --> 00:56:06,446
Yushin
has a memento for you of this day.

342
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:30,553
Put it in his eye.

343
00:56:37,436 --> 00:56:42,065
If your own life
means nothing to you, perhaps his does.

344
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:45,860
- Don't tell them anything!
- You will talk.

345
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:57,205
Yes?

346
00:57:32,741 --> 00:57:34,200
Don't do it!

347
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:38,204
Do it

348
00:57:38,372 --> 00:57:39,789
now!

349
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:11,737
Two-two-zero-five-six...

350
00:58:12,573 --> 00:58:14,782
Lone Wolf receive.

351
00:58:16,368 --> 00:58:18,828
This is Lone Wolf...

352
00:58:19,705 --> 00:58:23,958
Lone Wolf, this is Wolf's Den.
Transmit location and status.

353
00:58:24,376 --> 00:58:27,461
- What is it?
- It's Rambo, Sir.

354
00:58:28,547 --> 00:58:31,549
We read you,
Lone Wolf. What is your position? Over.

355
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:36,012
I say again:
What is your position? Over.

356
00:58:37,556 --> 00:58:41,309
Your friend dies if you do not answer.

357
00:58:43,187 --> 00:58:45,271
This is Trautman. Where are you?

358
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:51,527
Come in!

359
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:01,454
Murdock...

360
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:04,582
He's here.

361
00:59:08,921 --> 00:59:11,297
Rambo, we're glad you're alive.

362
00:59:12,132 --> 00:59:16,427
Where are you? Give us your position,
and we'll come to pick you up.

363
00:59:25,312 --> 00:59:26,437
Murdock...

364
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:31,692
I'm coming to get you!

365
01:01:54,086 --> 01:01:55,419
Duck!

366
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:01,902
This way.

367
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:42,109
We safe for now.

368
01:03:46,698 --> 01:03:51,076
- You look like hell, Rambo.
- Tough night.

369
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:54,288
Maybe need this.

370
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:59,877
- You hurt bad.
- It's alright.

371
01:04:06,927 --> 01:04:08,219
Listen...

372
01:04:09,012 --> 01:04:12,223
What you did back there...

373
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:14,975
... I won't forget it.

374
01:04:16,603 --> 01:04:17,686
Thanks.

375
01:04:20,732 --> 01:04:22,024
What you do now?

376
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:24,902
Try get across through Thailand?

377
01:04:25,070 --> 01:04:27,821
- Yeah.
- Then go America?

378
01:04:34,913 --> 01:04:36,997
You take me with you?

379
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:49,635
You take me?

380
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:52,972
Yeah.

381
01:04:56,393 --> 01:04:58,018
I think you make good choice.

382
01:05:01,022 --> 01:05:02,606
- We go?
- Let's go.

383
01:05:40,145 --> 01:05:41,812
You alright?

384
01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:58,495
You... not... forget... me.

385
01:05:58,663 --> 01:05:59,997
No.

386
01:06:18,683 --> 01:06:21,060
I want the rescue team
ready to go in one hour.

387
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:25,981
You're risking everything.
Do you think one man's worth all that?

388
01:06:26,149 --> 01:06:27,191
Yes.

389
01:06:27,692 --> 01:06:32,237
- I order you to withdraw.
- I'll go over your head.

390
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:36,742
You don't seem to understand that I'm
in charge here. You're just a tool.

391
01:06:38,536 --> 01:06:40,287
We're the machine.

392
01:06:41,081 --> 01:06:43,415
He's not to leave the base.

393
01:06:48,171 --> 01:06:52,883
- He never had a chance, did he?
- Like you said: He went home.

394
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:09,322
Get back.

395
01:21:13,661 --> 01:21:16,329
Come on! To the chopper!

396
01:21:16,497 --> 01:21:17,664
Move!

397
01:21:18,082 --> 01:21:20,166
To the chopper!

398
01:21:37,101 --> 01:21:38,393
Move!

399
01:22:11,468 --> 01:22:12,552
You guys made it!

400
01:22:50,591 --> 01:22:52,675
Chopper on your tail!

401
01:22:54,553 --> 01:22:55,637
Hang on!

402
01:24:24,768 --> 01:24:25,810
Hold on!

403
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:34,402
Fire in the tail!

404
01:26:38,777 --> 01:26:40,903
Lone Wolf calling Wolf's Den. Over.

405
01:26:42,322 --> 01:26:45,575
Lone Wolf calling Wolf's Den. Over.

406
01:26:46,285 --> 01:26:49,954
Wolf's Den,
this is Lone wolf, do you read?

407
01:26:52,749 --> 01:26:54,333
We hear you, Lone Wolf. Over.

408
01:26:54,501 --> 01:26:59,213
Prepare for emergency landing.
Arriving with American POWs.

409
01:27:11,476 --> 01:27:15,688
You heard.
Prepare for landing of POWs!

410
01:28:32,516 --> 01:28:34,558
Glad you made it.

411
01:29:46,006 --> 01:29:48,883
Rambo, I don't make the orders.

412
01:29:49,051 --> 01:29:51,177
I take them, just like you.

413
01:29:55,432 --> 01:29:59,310
I swear to God I didn't know
it was supposed to happen like this.

414
01:29:59,811 --> 01:30:02,605
It was just supposed
to be another assignment.

415
01:30:09,821 --> 01:30:10,863
Mission...

416
01:30:12,908 --> 01:30:14,158
... accomplished!

417
01:30:21,625 --> 01:30:23,834
You know there are more men out there.

418
01:30:24,711 --> 01:30:26,420
You know where they are.

419
01:30:28,715 --> 01:30:32,343
Find them, or I'll find you!

420
01:30:57,369 --> 01:30:59,120
Where are you going?

421
01:30:59,621 --> 01:31:01,330
I don't know.

422
01:31:02,958 --> 01:31:06,085
You'll get
a second Medal of Honor for this.

423
01:31:13,969 --> 01:31:18,597
They should give it to them.
They deserve it more.

424
01:31:19,850 --> 01:31:23,435
You can't keep running, John.
You're free now.

425
01:31:23,854 --> 01:31:26,063
Come back to us.

426
01:31:27,190 --> 01:31:29,024
Back to what?

427
01:31:30,068 --> 01:31:32,695
My friends died here,

428
01:31:33,738 --> 01:31:35,990
and part of me died here.

429
01:31:37,033 --> 01:31:42,621
The war may have been wrong,
but don't hate your country for it.

430
01:31:43,498 --> 01:31:44,623
Hate it?

431
01:31:45,876 --> 01:31:47,543
I'd die for it!

432
01:31:49,337 --> 01:31:51,338
What is it you want?

433
01:31:56,595 --> 01:31:58,137
I want

434
01:32:00,557 --> 01:32:02,641
what they want,

435
01:32:03,059 --> 01:32:06,312
and every other guy who came out here

436
01:32:06,730 --> 01:32:11,066
and spilt his guts
and gave everything he had:

437
01:32:12,986 --> 01:32:15,446
For our country to love us

438
01:32:15,906 --> 01:32:18,032
as much as we love it.

439
01:32:20,702 --> 01:32:22,411
That's what I want.

440
01:32:29,085 --> 01:32:32,922
- How will you live, John?
- Day by day.
