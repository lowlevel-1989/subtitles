1
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:08,880
 Oh, no.

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,480
-No!
- Hand over.

3
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,360
Thank you.

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,120
 It's nearly midnight,
can we please call it a draw?

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,120
No, because I'm clearly winning.
I just have unlucky rolls.

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,400
No, I'm winning because I have more money.

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,240
No, the winner is the superior
businessperson, and that's me.

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,480
No, I'm the superior businessperson
seeing as I have more money,

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,200
which is the goal of Monopoly.

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,640
You have more money
'cause you know the Monopoly cheats.

11
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,400
You can't cheat at Monopoly.

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,920
Oh, whoops.

13
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,560
Draw?

14
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,120
Draw.

15
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,960
Thank God.

16
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,560
There's never a good time to tell someone
their crush is going on a date

17
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,560
with someone else.

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,440
And I just don't like Nick.

19
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,880
I've seen him with those
nasty Year 11s at the school gate.

20
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,680
If they say anything mean to Charlie…

21
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,880
I'm going to crush them.

22
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,560
- Crush them?
-Verbally.

23
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,000
Doesn't sound like the safest tactic.

24
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,480
Well, I don't like playing safe.

25
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,560
Crisp?

26
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,040
Let's tell him when he gets back.

27
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,960
Fine, if it'll make you
stop talking about it.

28
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,280
-I think that Nick--
-Tao!

29
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,560
-What? Oh.
-Can we talk about something else?

30
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,200
Am I not being
entertaining enough for you?

31
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,840
No, you're not! You're being annoying.

32
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,800
Oh! I'm sorry.

33
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,280
What would you like instead?

34
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:36,200
Should I perhaps perform
a piece of interpretive dance?

35
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,600
Would that be less annoying?

36
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,280
That wasn't exactly what I had in mind.

37
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,840
Too late, you've said it now.

38
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,240
 No!

39
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,600
-How's this?
-This is worse.

40
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,160
I just think you can't
recognize talent when you see it.

41
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,320
I can, and this isn't it.

42
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,160
I can't believe this whole conversation
was a ploy for you

43
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,840
to witness
my incredibly erotic dance moves.

44
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,120
-Oh, my God, stop! Stop!
-Twerk!

45
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,520
Ow!

46
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,040
-Stop it.
- Work that ass!

47
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,120
Do I even want to know?

48
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,440
Ow!

49
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:11,000
So, I was thinking of inviting Nick
to my birthday thing on Saturday.

50
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,000
I really want him to come,

51
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,800
but I don't want it to be awkward or weird
since you don't really know him.

52
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,440
No, it wouldn't be awkward.

53
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,280
I assumed he was coming anyway.

54
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,200
Okay.

55
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,880
Good.

56
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,760
♪ I know that you don't want me
But that's fine ♪

57
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,240
♪ I want you to be fine

58

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,920
 Imogen.

61
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,160
About our date…

62
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,640
-See, I wasn't sure if…
-

63
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,480
Are you okay?

64
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,160
My dog died last night.

65
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,840
Um…

66
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,360
I'm so sorry.

67
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,040
He was really old so,
like, we knew it was coming.

68
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,920
I loved him so much.

69
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,640
This is the worst week ever.

70
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,760
Yeah.

71
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,000
What were you going to say about our date?

72
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,880
Nothing.

73
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,440
So, shall we meet at Nando's for dinner
and then we could go to the cinema?

74
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,960
Yeah.

75
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,440
Okay.

76
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,000
-Yusef.
-Here.

77
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,360
-Owen.
-Here.

78
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,200
-Ahmed.
-Here.

79
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,360
-Elliot.
-Here.

80
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,120
So, it's kind of my birthday on Saturday.

81
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,200
Is it?

82
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,400
Yeah.

83
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,280
Me and my friends are going bowling,

84
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,160
and I was going to ask
if you wanted to come,

85
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,640
but I know you don't really know them,
so you don't have to.

86
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,640
Yes.

87
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,720
 Nick and Charlie,
keep it down please.

88
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,200
-Caleb.
-Here.

89
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,560
-Jack.
-Here.

90
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,440
-Stanley.
-Here.

91
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,360
Kumar.

92
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,040
Thanks for giving me
barely any time to get you a present.

93
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,960
-You don't have to get me a present.
-No, I am.

94
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,280
-I'm serious.
-

95
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,200
 Here.

96
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,480
- Oscar.
-Here.

97
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,080
-Zikh.
-Here.

98
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,280
-Hakim.
-Here.

99
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,720
-Amir.
-Here.

100
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,680
You all right, mate?
Hyped for your date on Saturday?

101
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,720
Date on Saturday?

102
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,920
Yeah. Imogen told me
you're "meeting up" on Saturday.

103
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,040
Like, she's telling everyone, actually.

104
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,840
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I forgot.

105
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,240
So, if we meet there at 4:00
then we can play two games,

106
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,120
then get some food
and then hang around the arcade for a bit.

107
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,560
Oi, boys, boys, watch this.

108
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,920
 Watch out, dicknozzle.

109
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,840
You all right, mate?

110
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,240
Harry, don't start.

111
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,080
What? Are you best friends
with these weird little Year 10s now?

112
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,120
Just stop picking on people for no reason.

113
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,440
Aw! Are you gay for them? 

114
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,480
 Classic Harry.

115
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,720
Resorting to homophobia when
you can't think of a good comeback.

116
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,080
Mate, are you in a mood today?

117
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,880
Are you? Serious question.

118
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,240
Life must be really hard

119
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,880
when your only personality trait
is rich bell-end.

120
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,880
-You shouldn't have done that.
-What do you mean?

121
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,800
I know you're trying to help
but you're making things worse.

122
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,080
 I'm sticking up for you.

123
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,640
We have to show Harry that
he can't just walk all over us.

124
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,480
It's more complicated than that.

125
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,080
It's not them versus us.

126
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,760
-Because of Nick?
-Yeah.

127
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,920
He can look after himself.

128
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,920
I really don't want him
to be dragged into this.

129
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,160
Well, we can't possibly hurt
your new best friend, Nick Nelson.

130
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,840
-
-

131
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,400
Had a good day, Nicky?

132
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,680
Mmm.

133
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,320
What's up?

134
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,840
I said I'd go on a date with this girl,

135
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,000
but I kind of also agreed to go to
Charlie's birthday party on the same day.

136
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,200
Oh, do you like this girl?

137
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,720
Well, um…

138
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,400
Her dog died.

139
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,200
Uh, not following.

140
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,560
She was really upset, and I felt bad.

141
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,680
And she asked me out
and I didn't know how to say no.

142
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,400
And I tried to tell her
we probably shouldn't go out,

143
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,240
and I couldn't.

144
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,520
Because I didn't want to upset her
when she was already crying about her dog.

145
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,440
Oh, okay.

146
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,160
I mean…

147
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,360
A lot of people
are expecting us to get together,

148
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,280
but I don't think I like her like that.

149
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,960
You shouldn't go out with someone
because you feel sorry for them.

150
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,120
Yeah.

151
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,720
Don't worry. The right girl
will come along, just you wait.

152
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,920
♪ Go ahead and try my head ♪

153
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,040

154
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,120
You came.

155
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,600
Yeah, of course I did.

156
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,200
Happy birthday.

157
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,720
You didn't have to get me anything.

158
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,120
And I ignored you.

159
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,720
 Come on.

160
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,200
Am I the first one here?

161
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,280
No, you're actually the last.
We're over there. Lane 17.

162
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,520
I feel like I know her from somewhere.

163
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,840
That's Elle. She used to go to our school.

164
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,280
She would have been in your year,
but she moved to Higgs.

165
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,880
That's Isaac. He doesn't say a lot,
but he's really nice.

166
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,280
And you know Tao.

167
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,680
Sorry in advance if he says
anything rude to you.

168
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,840
That's just the way he is.

169
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,760
 Okay.

170
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,400
Ready to meet them?

171
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,320
Yeah.

172
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,840
 Everyone,

173
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,840
this is Nick.

174
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,040
-Hey.
- Hey.

175
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,960
Oh, good. We're just choosing
fun names for the board.

176
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,200
Fun names?

177
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,640
Yeah, and for the record,
Elle Smells was Tao's idea.

178
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,280
Can you at least try to get to know him?

179
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,760
I'll… try.

180
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,440
-That's close.
-Oh, no!

181
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,120
What are you doing?

182
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,760
That's it! I'm not doing it anymore.

183
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,400
No more, no more, no more.

184
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,600
-Yes! Come on!
- You did it!

185
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,080
Sorry.

186
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,200
-Why are these chips so good?
-They're so good.

187
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,880
-Oh, yeah.
-

188
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,560
 Yes!

189
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,360
I was so close.

190
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,720
You definitely cheated.

191
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,800
Oh, yeah? How?

192
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,360
You have strong rugby arms.

193
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,400
 Strong rugby arms?

194
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,880
-You okay?
-Yeah. Yeah. I'm good.

195
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,680
You've got an unfair advantage.

196
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,400
I thought you liked my arms.

197
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,680
Shut up.

198
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,720
Is everyone ready for a round two?

199
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,520
I'm just going to go find the bathroom.

200
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,440
I'm going to go talk to him.

201
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,360
About?

202
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,520
Tao. Tao, no. It's his birthday.

203
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,480
I have to.

204
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,440
Charlie.

205
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,640
Oh.

206
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,560
Hi.

207
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,360
Charlie, look.
I'm saying this to you as a friend.

208
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,080
You need to stop this thing
with Nick Nelson.

209
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,000
What?

210
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,240
He's going on a date with this girl.

211
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,120
I heard him agree to it
after that rugby match the other week.

212
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,880
That can't be true.

213
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,800
 Fine.

214
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,760
Don't believe me.
I'm clearly just lying for fun.

215
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,560
I'm going to go and get some chips.
Do you guys want anything?

216
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,680
Oh, can you get me a Coke?

217
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,040
-I'll pay.
- No, I'll get it.

218
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,160
-Okay.
-Isaac?

219
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,680
I'll also accept a can of Coke.
If you're paying.

220
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,720
Okay, all right. I'll be back in a minute.

221
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,080
Thanks.

222
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,600
 You know
he's just an attention-seeker

223
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,520
like Harry and the rest of his mates!

224
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,840
 Nick doesn't even like Harry.

225
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,680
Nick's basically risking everything
by hanging out with me, so--

226
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,960
Wow. I feel so sorry
for the popular rugby lad

227
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,320
who's almost getting picked on

228
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,560
because he dares to hang out
with someone below his popularity status.

229
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,000
You know that's not what I meant.

230
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,920
Now you're going to tell me
I'm being jealous

231
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,200
because you made a friend
and I'm scared of being alone?

232
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,360
Well…

233
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,520
Aren't you?

234
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,440
No!

235
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,200
I just don't like
seeing him mess with you.

236
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,440
 Do you really think
he's messing me around?

237
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,800
 I mean, that's what it looks like.

238
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,360
But…

239
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,640
He's…

240
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,040
He's…

241
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,120
my

242
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,120
friend.

243
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,640
 Fine.

244
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,320
But if he is even slightly mean to you…

245
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,240
Yeah.

246
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,240
You'll murder him. I know.

247
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,920
I was going to say
I'd send him a strongly worded DM,

248
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,040
but murder's fine too.

249
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,960
Ugh!

250
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,280
Just go.

251
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,320
Hi.

252
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,360
Hi.

253
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,560
Are you getting more food?

254
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,160
 I believe in you.

255
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,280
Yes! I win, I win!

256
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,800
Why am I so bad?

257
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,480
Uh, well, your arms are basically twigs.

258
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,720
Ah! How dare you?
I'm a very muscular individual.

259
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,040
You wish.

260
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,920
-How did you do that?
-I don't know.

261
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,200
-You're really good at it.
- Thank you.

262
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,760
Good game.

263
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,720
Good game.

264
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,720
Chip?

265
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,600
Thanks.

266
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,000
I don't know if this thing
with Charlie is a joke,

267
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,080
but for some reason, he really likes you,
and you're messing with him.

268
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,120
And I will not tolerate it,
so consider this your final warning.

269
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,200
Yeah.

270
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,320
You're right.

271
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,720
You're a good friend.

272
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,600
I know.

273
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,680
 Oh, my God,
what about the dance machine?

274
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,880
I'm so scared of it.

275
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,680
- Well, what do you want to play?
-I don't know.

276
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,520
 Do we have to run?

277
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,520
Yes, before someone occupies
the dance machine.

278
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,360
 Okay, come on. Come on, come on.

279
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,040
-What?
-

280
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,560
 I'm almost out of money now.

281
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,240
Don't look at me. I'm not giving you
more just so you can lose again.

282
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,200
Fine, I see how it is.

283
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,280
So, I, um…

284
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,000
I kind of overheard you and Tao
in the bathroom earlier.

285
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,200
Oh.

286
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,360
I wanted to say sorry

287
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,040
about the date with Imogen thing.

288
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,680
You actually went on a date with her?

289
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,120
No, no.

290
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,040
She just asked me out
and I was so surprised,

291
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,760
and all our mates were watching
and expecting me to say "yes"

292
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,520
and I was such an idiot,
I just blurted out "yes"

293
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,920
because I didn't know how to say "no"

294
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,400
without embarrassing her
and confusing all our mates.

295
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,800
And then her dog died.

296
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,880
And I felt really bad for her and…

297
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,240
I'm so sorry.

298
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,080
Isn't that what
you always tell me not to say?

299
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,800
Yeah, but…

300
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,320
I've actually done something bad.

301
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,840
Well, it's not like we're… you know…

302
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,440
officially dating or anything.

303
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,600
I'm going to make it right
with Imogen, I'm gonna…

304
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,760
tell her I don't like her like that.

305
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,440
Okay.

306
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,840
I wish I'd met you when I was younger.

307
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,800
-Yeah?
-Mmm.

308
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,600
I wish I'd…

309
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,400
known then what I know now.

310
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,360
No being sad on my birthday.

311
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,120
So, are you going to open my present then?

312
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,680
Yeah. As long as you don't mind.

313
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,360
Well, I kind of want to see your reaction.

314
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,520
I genuinely didn't have time to go out
and buy you something.

315
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,240
So…

316
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,400
Sorry it's a bit handmade.

317
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,840
That was just one of
my favorite days ever, so…

318
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,160
I really like you.

319
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,680
You like me?

320
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,880
Wasn't that obvious? 

321
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,359
Do you like me?

322
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,599
Yes! Obviously.

323
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,359
Why are we like this?

324
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,079
I want to kiss you so bad right now.

325
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:39,920
Okay.

326
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,720
You don't have to.

327
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,760
I want to.

328
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,800
Are you sure?

329
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,240

00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,760
I am the killer of aliens.

359
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:46,960
Yes!

360
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,280
Come on. Yes! Ooh!

361
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,280
Yes! A great success.

362
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,600
I was born to kill aliens.

363
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,040
Whoo!

364
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,280
-Hi.
-

365
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,160
 Oh, my God, is this Nellie?

366
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,960
 I'm sorry about your dog.

367
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,520
I thought Nellie might cheer you up a bit.

368
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,320
Thank you.

369
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,080
 Sorry about yesterday.

370
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,840
It's okay.

371
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,360
Imogen, I…

372
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,640
You're a really nice person but…

373
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,560
I don't like you like that.

374
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,240
It's not anything to do with you,

375
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,320
I just don't think we really

376
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,440
fit together.

377
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,320
I'm not sure I…

378
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,480
fit

379
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,800
with you or…

380
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,760
other people in our friend group.

381
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,840
But…

382
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,480
we've been friends for so long
and we hang out every morning.

383
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,040
Do you ever feel like

384
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,320
you're only doing things
because everyone else is?

385
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,400
And you're scared to change?

386
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:55,080
Or do something that might
confuse or surprise people?

387
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,120
Your real personality has been, like…

388
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,160
buried inside you

389
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,880
for a really long time.

390
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,880
I guess, um,

391
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,760
that's how I've been feeling recently.

392
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,440
Sorry, that probably makes no sense.

393
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,640
No.

394
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,320
I think I get it.

395
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,480
Thanks.

396
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,360
For being honest.

397
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,760
Yeah.

398
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,720
So, how was your date?

399
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,680
We decided we were better off as friends.

400
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,720
-All right, what did Nick do?
-Nothing.

401
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,160
I just think I can do better.

402
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,520
You're proper thick
about girls sometimes, aren't you, mate?

403
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,520
Every time, every time.
