1
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,280
 Mamma Mia?

2
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,280
We've seen that four times this year.

3
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,360
Oh, you think of something,
I'm going to dish up the pizzas.

4
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,960
I've got it. Pirates of the Caribbean.
It's a classic. What do you think?

5
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,880
Yeah.

6
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,760
That sounds good.

7
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,080
 Here. Let me.

8
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,120
Remember that summer,
we had to watch this every evening?

9
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,640
-It wasn't every evening.
-It was.

10
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,520
I could quote it
word for word by the end of it.

11
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,040
I knew it was because
you loved Keira Knightley.

12
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,000
-Mum.
-What? She's a very pretty girl.

13
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,280
-Please stop talking.
- I don't know.

14
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,320
Sorry, blacksmith's hands.
I know they're rough.

15
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,960
No. I mean, yes, they are, but…

16
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,040
Don't stop.

17
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,080
 I was about 14
when I realized I was bisexual.

18
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,320
I had a best friend at the time,
and we were completely inseparable.

19
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,720
And one day, we shared a kiss,
and I didn't feel weird about it.

20
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,880
I didn't feel like
it was an odd thing to do.

21
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,920
In fact, it felt incredibly right.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,920
I always felt like I had these feelings
for girls up to that point,

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,760
but all of a sudden
I started having feelings for guys too.

24
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,840
And that's when I realized, I'm bisexual.

25
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,280
This is a conversational lunchtime
gathering we've got going on here.

26
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,280
Elle? Are you looking
at Timothée Chamalet's Instagram again?

27
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,920
-No. 
- What are you doing then?

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
- Nothing.
-Probably texting Tao.

29
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,840
I can text my friends if I want to.

30
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,840
Texting Tao again.
Interesting. Interesting indeed.

31
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,280
 What are you implying?

32
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,480
-What do you think I'm implying?
-

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,520
I think I have a crush on Tao.

34
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,280
- I knew it.
-I literally knew it.

35
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,600
Shut up! It's not like
I can say anything to him.

36
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,480
He's my best friend,
and definitely doesn't like me back.

37
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,200
-You don't know that.
-I definitely do.

38
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,560
-You don't even want to try telling him?
-No. Can we talk about something else?

39
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,240
-Ugh. Boring. 
-Yeah.

40
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,720
-Watch out, dick-nozzle.
-

41
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,040
If you want my attention that badly,

42
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,960
why don't you throw something at me again?

43
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,880
Like your last remaining brain cell?

44
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,600
-Ooh.
-That's not even…

45
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,600
Wow.

46
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,840
-I think you hurt his feelings.
-Good.

47
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,760
It's never gonna work.
I always see you coming.

48
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,520
One day. One day I'll get you.

49
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,920
Mind the door. That's the one
that locks you in if you let it shut.

50
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,600
You realize this is the room?

51
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,080
The room?

52
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,480
Our special room.
We got locked in and had our first kiss.

53
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,760
What's going on? Are you okay?

54
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,120
Tara, Darcy. I know it's nice
to sit and gossip with your friends,

55
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,800
but you're both late
for rehearsal. Come on.

56
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:25,720
There's still one person
that doesn't know we're a couple.

57
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,640
Like, literally the only person
in a 50-mile radius, I swear to God.

58
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,440
-
-

59
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,320
Like, I never would have guessed
that you were gay,

60
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,880
but it's so cool and brave of you.

61
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,240
 Okay, eyes on me
please, girls. Sitting up.

62
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,720
Watching me, please.

63
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,880
With confidence,
please, everybody. Come on.

64
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,440
-
-Don't forget, ladies,

65
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,560
we'll be at Truham all day next Thursday
to practice for the spring concert.

66
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,800
Wait, we have another concert with them?

67
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,120
Darcy, I announced this weeks ago.

68
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,360
I think Truham and Higgs
should just combine into one giant school.

69
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,960
Yeah, same-sex schools
are a pointless idea generally.

70
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,320
I'm saying that as an absolute lesbian.

71
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,120
-She's so gross.
- Lesbians are so disgusting.

72
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,600
What is their problem?

73
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,840
I swear people
weren't like this before we came out.

74
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,400
Want me to throw cheese at them?
I've got leftover cheese from lunch.

75
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,040
Nah. It's not like
they're saying it to my face.

76
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,080
Why do you have leftover cheese?

77
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,040
It always pays to be prepared
with anti-homophobia cheese.

78
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,120
I had a question.

79
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,320
Yeah?

80
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,640
I just wondered, like…

81
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,160
How did you realize you were gay?

82
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,040
Oh. Uh…

83
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,760
I guess I've always been
sort of aware of it.

84
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,880
Even when I was really young.

85
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,360
I didn't understand it at the time, but…

86
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,760
It's always been boys.

87
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,080
I'm guessing you didn't feel
the same when you were little.

88
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,120
Well, no.

89
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,440
I don't know

90
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,520
what I am.

91
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,160
You don't have to figure it out right now.

92
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,520
I didn't just wake up one day like,
"Oh, look, guess I'm gay now."

93
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,000
Well…

94
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,120
I'm sorry for being all confused.

95
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,560
-I was the one who said sorry too much.
-Oi!

96
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,360
 Do you want to kiss?

97
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,080
Would that help?

98
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,760
Wow.

99
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,960
-Just a suggestion.
-Wow.

100
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,440
-If you're not interested then--
-Okay. Hang on.

101
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,040
It's a good suggestion.

102
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,680
Sorry.

103
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,080
Don't be sorry.

104
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,720
 Growing up bisexual
is constantly second-guessing yourself.

105
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,920
One day you'll have a crush on a guy,
the next day you have a crush on a girl,

106
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,040
and you're sitting there going,
"Which one is it? Make a choice."

107
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,640
And then you realize,
there isn't a choice.

108
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,360
It's a combination of the both.

109
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,040
Like, you can have both and it be okay.

110
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,280
 I can't believe you get
the whole day off to rehearse for this.

111
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,880
Sometimes playing
a musical instrument has its benefits.

112
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,320
When is the concert?

113
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,440
Friday night.

114
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,360
-Can I come?
-What? Why?

115
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,120
Because you're performing.

116
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,160
You don't have to come.

117
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,440
You've probably got
more interesting things to do.

118
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,280
Charlie, come on!
Your drum kit still isn't set up.

119
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,560
-Please come in at one, two…
- Hi, Nick.

120
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,200
 Tara.

121
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,040
-You're in the orchestra too?
-Yeah.

122
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,400
I have literally no musical ability.

123
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,760
Charlie tried to teach me the drums once
and I am absolutely crap.

124
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,800
You and Charlie getting along well then?

125
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,000
 Uh…

126
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,040
Yeah.

127
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,040
Actually…

128
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,080
Well…

129
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,520
We're sort of going out.

130
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,600
Are you?

131
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,480
I mean, we haven't made it official
or anything, but…

132
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,159
Yeah.

133
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,880
Please don't tell anyone though.

134
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,440
No, of course.

135
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,799
-Funny how things turned out between us.
-What do you mean?

136
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,799
I mean, when we were 13,

137
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,680
I thought we'd be boyfriend
and girlfriend forever.

138
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,880
Yep. So did I.

139
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,760
Are you and Darcy
out to your friends, then?

140
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,360
Since I, uh, posted on Insta,
everyone kind of knows now.

141
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,240
Um, some people were surprised,
a couple of people already knew…

142
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,000
-Darcy!
- Triumph at last.

143
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,120
Come on, girls. We're running
through it again in a minute.

144
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,520
We're here all day
if you want to meet us for lunch.

145
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,960
Yeah, that'd be nice.

146
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,920
 Okay, everyone. From the top!

147
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,120
Oh, my God, we've found another one.

148
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,120
You can't tell anyone.
She won't tell anyone.

149
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,240
Yeah, I, um…

150
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,240
 Not having lunch
with your boyfriend?

151
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,800
 No, I'm waiting
for your mum, actually.

152
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,960
 Classic!

153
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,200
 Yeah, whatever.

154
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,320
I'm not really… out yet, or anything.

155
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,720
Do you want to be?

156
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,880
I don't know.

157
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,400
I mean, I don't even know
what my sexuality is.

158
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,360
 That's okay.

159
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,200
Tara didn't know she was a lesbian
until we'd kissed, like, six times.

160
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,320
It was two times.

161
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,880
Oh, my God, do you know
what we need to do? Double dates.

162
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:14,120
Us and Charlie, tomorrow night,
before the concert, milkshakes.

163
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,160
-I like milkshakes.
- Good.

164
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,920
Don't feel like you have to come out
to anyone before you're ready.

165
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,240
Oh. Yeah.

166
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,480
Being out is hard.

167
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,720
A lot of people
will see you in a different way,

168
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,280
and it is a lot to deal with.

169
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,320
Can I ask you something?

170
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,280
Yeah.

171
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,920
Are you, like…

172
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,360
definitely gay?

173
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,360
Or do you think you're bi, or…

174
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:43,120
I mean, when we were 13,
I think I did like you.

175
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,320
I mean, I think I have liked girls before,
so I wondered if you felt the same.

176
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,480
I'm definitely gay.
Kissing you was actually one of the things

177
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,120
that made me realize
I don't like kissing guys.

178
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,040
 Okay…

179
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,200
Um…

180
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,920
-Happy to help.
-

181
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,440
Uh, see you tomorrow?

182
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,560
Yeah, that sounds really good.

183
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,920
Um…

184
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,280
You're kind of the first people
I've told about Charlie.

185
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,920
Really?

186
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,160
Yeah.

187
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,680
And does it feel good
to have told someone?

188
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,720
Yeah.

189
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,720
Really does.

190
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,560
You can't come in here.
Nick's coming round.

191
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,560
Oh.

192
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,400
I didn't realize you were
in a committed relationship.

193
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,360
What?

194
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,480
We're not…

195
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,200
He's not…

196
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,120
Shut up.

197
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,960
Wow. So not ready
to tie the knot yet then?

198
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,880
 Shut up.

199
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,000
Even if we were together…

200
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:16,920
What?

201
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,760
What?

202
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,040
You're staring.

203
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,920
-No I wasn't.
-Yeah, you were.

204
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,480
-Do your homework.
-

205
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,160
You know, I was talking
to Tara at the rehearsal today…

206
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,400
Yeah?

207
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,080
-You heard she came out, right?
-Yeah, she put it on Insta.

208
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,880
I told her we're together.

209
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,800
What?

210
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,680
I told her we're going out.

211
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,200
Oh, my God, that's amazing.

212
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,040
 You're amazing.

213
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,720
Wait. Are you sure you wanted to?

214
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,680
Um, yeah.

215
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,000
You didn't force yourself
because I'm out--

216
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,720
No, I wanted to tell them.

217
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,960
 So, how about
the concert tomorrow night?

218
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,600
You really don't have to come.

219
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,920
-It'll be boring.
-No, I want to support you.

220
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,120
 Um…

221
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,440
Okay, but if you change
your mind, that's fine.

222
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,760
And Tara and Darcy want us to go

223
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,640
and get milkshakes
with them before it starts.

224
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,640
Like a double date.

225
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,920
I've never been on a date.

226
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,080
Me neither.

227
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,640
Want to go on one?

228
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,560
Yeah.

229
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,040
Cool. Um…

230
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,160
I'll…

231
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,440
I'll see you tomorrow.

232
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,440
Okay.

233
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,720
Bye.

234
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,120
Bye.

235
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,120
Ooh, ooh.

236
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,560
Oh. Oh!

237
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,480
 Oh, no. Oh, no.

238
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,760
Oh, whoa, whoa. Whoa!

239
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,560
Since when were you coming to this?

240
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,080
I thought it was bribery
to get me to come to his boring concert.

241
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,120
-You're here for the milkshakes then?
-I said what I said.

242
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,360
 Come on.

243
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,720
 Do you ever play film music?

244
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,560
- Yeah, sometimes.
-Well, then it's not boring.

245
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,560
Why'd you agree to come then?

246
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,920
Because I'm a very nice
and supportive friend.

247
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,720
No, he came for the milkshakes
and the milkshakes only.

248
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,240
-I said that to you in confidence.
-How did you two become friends?

249
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:59,000
I was friends with Charlie first
and Tao came along as a package deal.

250
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,200
-
-

251
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,960
 Rude!
You're lucky to have me.

252
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,640
You make a cute little pair.

253
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,240
So, we're ordering a second round, right?

254
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,360
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

255
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,280
-We can go and get them.
- Can I have a strawberry one?

256
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,880
-Strawberry.
-Banana again.

257
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,600
Oh, my God, no, that is a crime!

258
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,400
I cannot believe you're disrespecting
bubblegum flavor in front of me.

259
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,200
Right. Let me try yours.

260
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,520
Wow.

261
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,520
See? I make good choices.

262
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,680
-We should swap.
-No, you made your choice.

263
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,760
Okay, well, we can share.

264
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,520
We are on a date.

265
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,080
Is that the official rule of dating?

266
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,160
Sharing drinks?

267
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,200
Yeah.

268
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,600
We should go on a date, just us.

269
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,200
I mean, if you want to.

270
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,400
It's all right if you don't want to.

271
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,400
Actually, no, sorry, that was stupid.

272
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,440
We should.

273
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,240
I'd like that.

274
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,920
After we'd kissed, like, six times…

275
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,200
-It was two, but sure.
-…Tara agreed to be my girlfriend.

276
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,200
That's a really cute story.
You two seem good together.

277
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,960
Yeah, I think
it's because we're friends too.

278
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,280
Seems obvious. You should be good friends
with the person you're dating.

279
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,880
Yeah.

280
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,720
That makes sense.

281
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,760
Yeah.

282
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:32,200
Tao, can you come
help us carry the glasses?

283
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,200
Yeah.

284
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,760
-What are you doing?
-What do you mean?

285
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,040
You're clearly trying to set something up
between me and Tao.

286
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,320
We thought if we could hint to him
that you'd make a good couple…

287
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,320
-But I didn't ask you to do that.
-But you like him, so--

288
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,440
I don't want him to know that.
Just because you two came out,

289
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,960
doesn't mean I also want
to share all my secrets.

290
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,400
Friendship is more important.
If he knew, things would change,

291
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,080
and I've had to deal
with enough changes in my life lately.

292
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,040
I don't want anything else to change.

293
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,760
Yeah. Sharing stuff
like that changes everything.

294
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,680
Not always for the better.

295
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,480
Bubblegum's more interesting.
It's more interesting.

296
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,240
-Not interrupting anything, am I?
-Um, what?

297
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,560
No, we were just chatting.

298
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:23,880
Okay then.

299
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,840
You take those back,
I'll wait for the last two.

300
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,640
-Are you sure?
- Yeah.

301
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,920
Okay.

302
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,640
-Thanks.
- Cheers.

303
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,800
 Here we are.

304
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,520
Is this some sort of
"no boys allowed" conversation?

305
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,920
Did you know this too?

306
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,880
The me and Tao thing.

307
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,960
Um…

308
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,600
Yeah.

309
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,480
So this whole thing was just a setup?

310
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,440
We thought it would be fun
to go on a triple date.

311
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,520
A triple date?

312
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,080
Yeah. You and Tao, Tara and Darcy, and…

313
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,360
You and Charlie?

314
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,120
Yeah.

315
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,440
You two are together?

316
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:19,080
-Yeah.
- Charlie! I'm so happy for you.

317
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,960
I mean, I'm happy for you too,

318
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,440
but you didn't have to witness
all the months of intense pining--

319
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,560
 Elle!

320
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,240
Do Tao and Isaac know?

321
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,680
I think Isaac guessed, like,
almost immediately after we got together.

322
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,320
And what about Tao?

323
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,240
Not yet.

324
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,680
I'm going to tell him.
I need to find the right time.

325
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,360
But he's the only one who doesn't know.

326
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,360
 Um…

327
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,200
Just so you know,
the concert's starting in 15 minutes.

328
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,280
 Oh!

329
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,240
-I really love you.
-Aw, I love you too.

330
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,240
Tara, Darcy, hurry up, you're late.
Sit down, chop chop. Thank you.

331
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,800
Uh, can I have less chatting,
more tuning, please? Thank you.

332
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,800
 Don't look at her,
you'll catch the lesbian disease.

333
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,480
 It went well last time,
but we'll do it better today, aren't we?

334
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,040
Come on, put your foot under.

335
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,600
Take it. And that one.

336
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,160
 Okay. 

337
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,680
And then, um…

338
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,800
I'm glad you came.

339
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,880
-It seemed like you didn't want me to.
-No, I did. I just…

340
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,880
I thought you were trying not to be rude.

341
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,840
No.

342
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,080
I just…

343
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,520
I like being with you.

344
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,520
Also, we've been hanging out a lot and…

345
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,600
If people guessed we were together,

346
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,640
if they started
saying stuff about you then…

347
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,320
Well, I really don't want you
to have to deal with that.

348
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,240
I, um…

349
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,760
I've been researching about

350
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,000
being bisexual.

351
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,760
Uh…

352
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,520
I think that might be me.

353
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,920
But I… I'm not sure.

354
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,280
Has anyone seen Tara and Darcy?

355
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,880
I'm about to open
the doors for the audience.

356
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,960
I just want some peace and quiet.

357
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,880
The door!

358
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,640
Oh, no.

359
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,680
No signal.

360
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,880
Can't believe this is the second time
we've been locked inside here.

361
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,840
-Sorry.
-It's fine.

362
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,720
Didn't want to do
the concert thing anyway.

363
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,720
Talk to me.

364
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,320
Everything's changed.

365
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,960
-Since we came out?
-Yeah.

366
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,320
Do you regret it?

367
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,720
No.  I just wasn't prepared
for things to change.

368
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,080
I didn't… I didn't think
so many people would suddenly think

369
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,960
I'm a completely different person.

370
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,240
-They don't think that.
-They do.

371
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,720
It's different for me.
You came out years ago.

372
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,880
I'm not loud and confident
about being a lesbian.

373
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,280
I could barely say the word lesbian
when we started going out,

374
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:36,040
and now I've got people on my Instagram,
like, "Oh, my God, you're a lesbian."

375
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,960
People giving me funny looks
in the corridors.

376
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,480
I wasn't prepared for any of it.

377
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,840
I don't know how to behave anymore and…

378
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,360
I just want to live my life.

379
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:52,000
You're so confident about your sexuality,
and I still feel like I know nothing.

380
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,000
Hey, I don't know anything either.

381
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,240
I don't know anything about anything.

382
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,280
I just want to live my life.

383
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,240
 We can do that.

384
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,680
You seem gay enough to me.

385
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,120
Shut up. 

386
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,520
I think it will get easier.

387
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,200
Yeah.

388
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,440
I know.

389
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,000
- Tara!
- Tara!

390
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,640
Tara?

391
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,560
 Tara!

392
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,200
Homophobia.

393
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,760
We're in here, we got locked in!

394
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,200
-Darcy!
-Tara!

395
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,280
Tara!

396
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,960
 We're in here! In here!

397
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,000
Hey.

398
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,760
You guys are supposed
to be on stage, like, right now.

399
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,520
Hurry up!

400
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,880
 You know I can't run,
it's not my fault!

401
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,760
 Thanks, "boy I kissed one time."

402
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,040
No problem, "girl I kissed one time."

403
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,080
You going to be okay?

404
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,360
Yeah. I'll be okay.

405
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,280
You?

406
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,000
Yeah.
