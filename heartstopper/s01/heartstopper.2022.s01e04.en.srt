1
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,119
Um…

2
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,520
I'm sorry for not texting you. Uh…

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,120
I just wanted to talk in person.

4
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:22,920
Okay.

5
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,000
Just…

6
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,880
Just come in, you're getting soaked.

7
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,160
Yeah, good idea.

8
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,120
Did you forget a coat?

9
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,680
Oh. Uh…

10
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,880
Yeah, I didn't check the weather
before I left.

11
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,960
-Idiot.
-

12
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,960
Um… 

13
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,520
So, about last night. Um…

14
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,680
-I just wanted to say--
- Nick.

15
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,200
I didn't know you were coming round.

16
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,120
Um…

17
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,720
Yeah. Sorry, yeah.

18
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,400
He's just picking up
a jumper he left here last week.

19
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,280
Right.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,600
Uh, well, don't forget we're going
to Grandma's this morning, Charlie.

21
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,760
You could at least
change out of your pajamas.

22
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,920
Let's go to my room.

23
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,360
Uh…

24
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,720
-So--
-I'm so sorry.

25
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,880
I'm so sorry. It was…

26
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,480
I didn't think properly
about what I was doing and…

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,200
I did a stupid thing.
I don't want you to feel awkward about it.

28
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,720
-It was all my fault.
-Hang on.

29
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,440
I shouldn't have kissed you.

30
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,680
I bet you just felt pressured
to do it because I asked,

31
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,160
and you probably
don't wanna talk to me again,

32
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,920
but I at least had to say sorry.

33
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,920
See if there's a chance
we can still be friends?

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,720
-Charlie--
-I don't want to lose you

35
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,880
-because I did something stupid.
-Charlie.

36
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,080
Um…

37
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,720
God.

38
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,680
I'm so sorry, I…

39
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,840
I'm just so sorry I ran away last night.

40
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,520
I was just freaking out because, uh…

41
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:05,000
I was confused
and surprised and, like, honestly…

42
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,400
I'm having a proper, full-on gay crisis.

43
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,440
And it's not that
I didn't want to, you know…

44
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,320
kiss you.

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,040
I just… 

46
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,680
I was just so confused.

47
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,320
I've just been so, so confused.

48
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,120
I just think I need some time to…

49
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,280
figure this out.

50
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:21,600
At school… is it okay if we, like…

51
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,279
Keep this a secret?

52
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:27,840
Yeah.

53
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,040
I just don't really know if I can, uh…

54
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,080
You know.

55
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,640
Come out as anything.

56
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,560
Yeah.

57
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,880
It's fine.

58
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,040

Hey.

82
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,440
Something's different.

83
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,280
What?

84
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,840
- Have you changed your hair?
-What? No.

85
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,040
You have!
I've known you since, like, Year 7.

86
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,880
I can tell when something's changed.
You look different.

87
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,200
It's different now you're messing with it.

88
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,800
Don't worry,
I'm a highly qualified hair stylist.

89
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,280
Qualified from where?

90
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,800
-The University of Hair Stylists.
-Wow.

91
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,040
Yeah, seems legit.

92
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,920
Oh, I've got to go.
I forgot I had morning detention.

93
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,240
Hi.

94
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,240
Hi.

95
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,000
 Morning.

96
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,160
What?

97
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,600
-Oh. Hi.
-Hi.

98
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,760
Is this how it's going to be now?

99
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,720
-Am I officially the third wheel?
- No.

100
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,760
We're finally taking the opportunity
to kiss as much as possible.

101
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,000
No, we're not. 
Did you finish your work?

102
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,360
-Probably.
-Probably not, eh?

103
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,760
There's a boy in there, waiting for you.

104
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,640
Oh.

105
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,600
Yeah.

106
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,960
Is it the secret boyfriend
or the straight boy crush?

107
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,360
-He's on the rugby team.
-Hmm.

108
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,880
-I joined the rugby team.
-Mmm.

109
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,680
-Of course you did.
-

110
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,600
 Don't get crumbs on the floor

111
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,240
or I'll get told off
by the cleaners. Again.

112
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,040
Go on.

113
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,720
Hi.

114
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,680
 Hi.

115
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,200
I missed you.

116
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,800
I saw you in form, like, four hours ago.

117
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,520
Sure your friends don't mind
you eating lunch with me?

118
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,160
Nah. They can deal with it.

119
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,360
Clearly, I need to be here to get tips
on how to be good at rugby.

120
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,960
Oh, really? So that's what
this is actually all about then?

121
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,120
- Maybe.
-

122
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,640
Feels nice to be able
to ditch my friends for once.

123
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:35,280
All they want to do at lunch is just sit
on the field and chuck stuff at people.

124
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,320
Chuck stuff?

125
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,240
Yep.

126
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,480
Mainly Harry.

127
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,880
He's an idiot.

128
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,400
My friends are nothing like you.

129
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,840
Are we even allowed in here?

130
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,720
Yeah. I used to
come in here a lot last year.

131
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,520
Like, when the bullying was really bad.

132
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,520
Mr. Ajayi was the only teacher
who really cared that much.

133
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,480
Well, he was giving me evils
before you got here.

134
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,360
He must have thought you were Ben.

135
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,600
I told him about the "Ben making me
keep us a secret" thing.

136
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,000
Not… I mean, that's nothing
like what we're doing.

137
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,320
You're nothing like him.

138
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,080
This is completely different.

139
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,000
Yeah.

140
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,760
-
-

141
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,680
 That's it boys, tackle low.

142
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,240
Get over the ball.

143
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,160
Kick it!

144
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,920
-Go for the tackle, boys.
- Charlie!

145
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,480
Come on, man. For the third time!

146
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,160
Is he going to tackle anyone,
or is he gonna stand there?

147
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,760
-Why did he even join the team?
- All right.

148
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,440
 Boys, quick.

149
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,520
 We all need to step up
for the St. John's match.

150
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,640
 Yeah.

151
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,640
 If we can't even tackle them,
we've got no chance. No chance at all.

152
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,280
You're on cone collection today, Charlie.

153
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,120
 Okay.

154
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,520
You gonna be okay for the match next week?

155
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,160
I'd keep you on reserve for longer,

156
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,960
but Kieran has an unavoidable
dentist appointment.

157
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:17,880
I'll be fine.

158
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,080
About the tackling,
you've really got to commit to it, okay?

159
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,600
Try not to worry about getting hurt
and just throw yourself into it.

160
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,520
-Okay.
-It's all about confidence.

161
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,800
Well, it's hard to be confident
when they all see me

162
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,600
as a stereotypical gay boy
who can't do sports.

163
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,120

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,840
Well, apparently they were kissing
at Harry's party. Like, properly kissing.

182
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,040
Yeah, well, some girls
who are friends just do that.

183
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,840
Actually, when you think about it,
there are 1,200 people at this school,

184
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,520
so at least a few of them
are going to be lesbians.

185
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,960
Maybe you're a lesbian
and you have no idea.

186
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,360
It'll die down soon, won't it?

187
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,400
I really, really hope so.

188
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,880
Tara, I need to talk to you.

189
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,880
 Oh, God.

190
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,880
Hi, Imogen, what's up?

191
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,960
One minute I hear you
and Nick are a thing,

192
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,560
the next I hear you're kissing
some girl at Harry's party.

193
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,080
Tara literally kisses
her girlfriend at a crowded party,

194
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,520
and people are still asking her
if she's dating a guy

195
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,880
she kissed once when she was 13?

196
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,520
-So that girl is her girlfriend?
-That girl? I'm right here!

197
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,120
All right. Fine, I was just asking.

198
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,680
Just so you know, me and Nick
are together, so I just needed to check.

199
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,840
You and Nick Nelson are together?

200
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,160
 Mmm-hmm.

201
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,600
I mean, pretty much. 

202
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,440
Look, we look cute together.

203
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,120
Yeah. Very cute.

204
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,960
So you and Nick are definitely not--

205
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,120
-I'm a lesbian.
- Okay.

206
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,400
I'm not, like, homophobic.

207
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,720
I'm an ally.

208
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,840
Congratulations?

209
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,800
We thank you for your service.

210
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,120
I bet Charlie's eating lunch
with Nick again.

211
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,960
He's been eating lunch with him a lot.

212
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,840
Well, they're in the honeymoon phase.

213
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,720
It's not even like they're dating.

214
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,720
Unless they are.

215
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,560
 I mean… Look at them.

216
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,680
It's a bad idea to even walk near them,
let alone actually befriend one of them.

217
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,520
Charlie's putting himself in danger

218
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,880
just because he has
a little unrequited crush.

219
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,080
Oi, catch.

220
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,600
 Sorry, mate.

221
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,960
-Oh, my God.
-You okay?

222
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,600
Yes.

223
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,360
Can I have the ball back?

224
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,240
 No.

225
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,000
It's mine now.

226
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,120
 Ooh.

227
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,760
Ooh!

228
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,920
So, all my friends are showing up
in a bit to watch me play.

229
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,640
All your friends?

230
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,360
Tao, Isaac and Elle.

231
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,040
I've said they really
didn't have to come, but…

232
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,200
Elle said they wanted to be supportive.

233
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,720
Oh. That's…

234
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,160
That's nice.

235
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,040
Don't worry.

236
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,280
I won't say anything about us.

237
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,600
Oh.

238
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,960
Yeah, good. Thanks.

239
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,200
You sure it's okay?

240
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,400
Yeah. Of course.

241
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,000
Not going to flake out today, are you?

242
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,000
-No.
-We're counting on you.

243
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,000
-They're here. I'll be right back.
- Let's line up.

244
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,040
Groups of three
for the passing exercise. Let's go.

245
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,200
-Hi.
-Oh, my God, I missed you.

246
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,400
-You too.
-Excuse me, where's our hug?

247
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,680
I see you all the time.

248
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,800
So this is Tara and Darcy.

249
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,840
 Yeah. Hi.

250
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,600
 Charlie!

251
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,400
My guy.

252
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,560
I'm not gonna lie to you,

253
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:51,080
I'm mainly here to get acquainted
with the local gays, but, you know,

254
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,840
you and Nick Nelson
are looking suspiciously couple-y.

255
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,600
Oh, my God, please ignore her.

256
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,040
We're friends. He's my friend.

257
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,400
Well, friends as in friends,
or friends as in friends?

258
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,480
Darcy.

259
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,080
Why? Are there rumors, or…

260
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,720
No, no. Nothing but my gay intuition.

261
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,160
I promise.
We're totally platonic, good friends.

262
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,960
Disappointing, but… Okay.

263
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,319
You all right, Nick?

264
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,040
Oi, Nick! Come, come.

265
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,319
Join in, yeah?

266
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,080
Quick question.

267
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,360
Why are the other team literal adult men?

268
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,120
They're a specialist sports school.

269
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,280
 Oh, wow.

270
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,880
Oh, God.

271
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,520
Sorry.

272
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:51,920
Nervous.

273
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,560
 Be dominant.
We have to show them who we are,

274
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,080
what we're proud of, yeah, boys?
One, two, three!

275
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,280
-
-

276
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,440
 Come on, boys.

277
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,520
All right, line up, boys.

278
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,880
Come on, Nicholas!

279
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,560
Harry, don't let the game go soft.

280
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:26,640
So, does anyone remember
the rules of rugby because I don't.

281
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,920
- No.
-Yeah.

282
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,120
Come on, Nicholas!

283
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,320
Ooh.

284
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,400
Come on. Let's go, boys. Come on!

285
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,080
Head up!

286
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,200
-
-

287
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,160
There we are, yeah.

288
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,640
 Five, six, seven. Heave!

289
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,080
-
-Charlie!

290
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,600
-Ow.
-Oh, my gosh.

291
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,080
 Get back up, Charlie.

292
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,280
Yes, Charlie!

293
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,720
-Shake it off, it's fine! Come on!
-Yes!

294
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,280
Hold it.

295
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,520
-
-

296
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,800
Mate. See that number 14, yeah?

297
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,160
He definitely has something for you, mate.

298
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,040
A crush or something, mate.

299
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,000
 Is Harry Green picking on Charlie?

300
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,440
 Maybe they're friends.

301
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,600
 That's even worse.

302
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,000
Next, Charlie will be bringing
the whole rugby team

303
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,720
to our film night
and making us watch Avengers or something.

304
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,680
Is that your nightmare scenario?

305
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,920
Watching a movie you hate
with people you don't like very much?

306
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,120
Charlie's befriending bullies,
and our friendship group is falling apart.

307
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,880
-Take this seriously.
-Hey.

308
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,200
I didn't come to risk seeing
all the Truham Boys who used to pick on me

309
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,320
just for you to tell me
our friendship group's falling apart.

310
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,680
Go after him, mate. 100%.

311
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,960
All right. Boys, set up. Set up.

312
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,800
Go on, mate.

313
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,320
Keep your head up, Charlie.

314
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,200
- Hang in there, boys.
- Come on!

315
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,320
-Charlie!
-

316
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,040
 Is it okay if we, like…

317
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,160
Keep this a secret?

318
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,080
 Yeah.

319
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:16,160
 Okay, that's it, I'm calling it.
This rain is too dangerous!

320
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,000
Match is over! Everyone off the pitch!

321
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:36,920
Hey.

322
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,560
Hey.

323
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,480
Is your nose okay?

324
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,400
I don't know.

325
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,560
Let me see.

326
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,080
It looks fine.

327
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,640
Cool.

328
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,920
You've got some mud on your face though.

329
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,680
Um, sorry… 

330
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,840
What?

331
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,440
I'm really sorry
for being all clingy and annoying.

332
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,800
I'm making this so awkward.

333
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,520
You wanted to keep us a secret
and I'm messing it up.

334
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,440
I'm the one who should be saying sorry.

335
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,160
 Uh…

336
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,080
Sorry…

337
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,640
for, um…

338
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,720
interrupting, but Ms. Singh told me
to give you some… antiseptic wipes.

339
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,920
Okay.

340
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,640
Um… 

341
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,320
I'd better go.

342
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,880
Okay.

343
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,160
Isaac won't say anything.

344
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:10,880
Yeah.

345
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,240
Okay.

346
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,480
Charlie's not going to give up
on Nick Nelson, is he?

347
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,440
Highly doubt it.

348
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,040
Maybe we should
just stop getting involved.

349
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,440
I can't believe
you just actually suggested that.

350
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,160
You, Tao Xu,
King of Getting Involved. 

351
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,400
Shut up.

352
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,040
-It was nice meeting your friends though.
-Yeah?

353
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,320
Yeah.

354
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,560
They seem cool.

355
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,520
They are.

356
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,960
Have they replaced us?

357
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,600
As if anyone could replace

358
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,840
your incredibly annoying,
loud presence in my life.

359
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,680
- How dare you?

360
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,480
 Who you waiting for?

361
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,920
 I was just waiting to see Nick.

362
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,360
-Oh. Finally ready to make a move?
- I know…

363
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,880
-Just piss off, Harry.
- Ooh!

364
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,440
Okay, fine. If you're gonna be
a coward about it.

365
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,160
 Ooh, feisty.

366
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,640
Oh. Hey.

367
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,600
Hey!

368
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,440
What's up?

369
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,120
You did so good.

370
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,240
Uh, I mean, the match was cancelled
and we were losing anyway, but…

371
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,440
Thanks.

372
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,400
So what's going on?

373
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,800
 I…

374
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,840
I…

375
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:41,560
wanted to ask you if, um…

376
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,720
Like, this is really random.


377
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:50,040
But maybe we could,
like… go out somewhere.

378
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,800
-
-Together.

379
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,120
Like, I guess sort of a… date.

380
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,560
Or something.

381
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,360
Oh. Um…

382
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,640
 Go on, Nick.

383
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,320
Yeah. I guess so, sure.

384
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,200
 Yes, lad.

385
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,520
Lads, let's get out of here.
