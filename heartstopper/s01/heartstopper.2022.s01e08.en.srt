1
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,680
You're being very loud.

2
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,000
I have my headphones on.

3
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,000
You're still hitting the drums loudly,

4
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,840
-I can hear it through the wall.
-Fine. Sorry.

5
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,520
Are you angry at anything in particular?

6
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,320
Or have you decided
to finally have a rebellious phase?

7
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,680
Did something happen?

8
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,880
Didn't you hear about
Harry Green's fight with Nick and Tao?

9
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,760
Both my fault, by the way.

10
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,680
Yeah. I'm like 95% sure they were both
Harry's fault, and I wasn't even there.

11
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,920
What's going on?

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,440
Before I met Nick, I was sort of

13
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,400
going out with this other guy.

14
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,800
I liked him, but…

15
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,080
he made me feel
like I was ruining his life.

16
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,560
Like he didn't want me to even exist.

17
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,320
And now Nick's lost all his friends,

18
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,600
and he's getting into fights
because of me.

19
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,560
And I just feel like

20
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,840
maybe I do just ruin people's lives.

21
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,280
And it would be better if I didn't exist.

22
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,360
 You're not ruining my life.

23
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,880
Thanks.

24
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,080
I could make us some pizza for dinner?

25
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,680
Would that help?

26
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,200
I'm not very hungry.

27
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,440
I might just eat later.

28
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,200
Okay.

29
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,160
Tao.

30
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,400
I heard Harry
got suspended for fighting, so…

31
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,160
That's good.

32
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,520
He said he doesn't want to talk to you.

33
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,680
 Okay, Year 10s.

34
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,920
Before we start today's lesson,
I've been told to remind you all

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,880
that the Truham-Higgs Sports Day
is on Friday.

36
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,200
So make sure you've all signed up
for an event by Thursday.

37
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,240
We could all do the javelin again,

38
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,400
-like last year.
-You're on the rugby team.

39
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,320
What? So?

40
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,960
The rugby team always do
the Sports Day rugby match.

41
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,040
So, I… I don't think
we can do the same event this year.

42
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,520
Hey.

43
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,960
Hey.

44
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,440
Did you want to get lunch together?

45
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,200
Um…

46
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,480
I can't.

47
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,560
Sorry.

48
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,080
-
-Come in.

49
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,120
Charlie! How's it going?

50
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,200
 Um…

51
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,400
I think I'm going to quit the rugby team.

52
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,320
Why?

53
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,200
I just don't think rugby's for me.

54
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,760
Have the boys been giving you a hard time?

55
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,720
-Do I need to talk to anyone?
-No.

56
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,840
It's just me.

57
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,080
Where's Charlie?

58
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,760
I thought he'd be here.

59
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,360
I thought he was eating with you.

60
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,280
- Charlie avoiding you too?
-I'm avoiding him.

61
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,320
-Why?
- Because I'm pissed off with him.

62
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,160
Oh.

63
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,440
Charlie's my friend. I was worried
about him joining the rugby team

64
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,000
and becoming friends with you

65
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,760
because I knew that he'd get picked on
by some of the idiots in your year.

66
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,520
And guess what? He did.

67
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,240
I'm done trying to protect him
when he's forgotten I exist, like…

68
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,960
I deserve to be appreciated.

69
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,400
If he'd just told me
that you two were going out, like…

70
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,920
Maybe I would've done things differently.

71
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,720
Maybe I would have stayed more low-key
and Harry would have left us alone.

72
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,840
I think Charlie might be nervous
about telling you

73
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,080
because he really cares
about your opinion.

74
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,240
Because he loves you a lot.

75
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,360
Yeah.

76
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,560
Well, I'll believe that
when I actually see it.

77
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,360
Why's he avoiding you?

78
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,520
I think maybe…

79
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,600
he's finding it hard having
to lie to people about us.

80
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,120
He's not angry about me being
in the closet or anything, like…

81
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,000
He knows I'm not ready to come out, but…

82
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,960
Look…

83
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,480
I've known Charlie since we were 11,

84
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,720
and he's always had a tendency
to believe that him just existing

85
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,280
is annoying for other people.

86
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,320
Yeah.

87
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,480
I sort of got that impression.

88
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,320
He's not going to force you
to come out. Which is good.

89
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,000
He would literally never tell you this,

90
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,280
but he probably wants to be something more

91
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,040
than "secret guy you kiss sometimes
on the down-low."

92
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,240
And if you can't give him
more than that then…

93
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,720
I mean, that's fine,

94
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,000
but it's always gonna make him feel
a little bit crap about himself.

95
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,760
Oh.

96
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,080
You should talk to him.

97
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,480
-Yeah, so should you.
-No.

98
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,760
I'm gonna stay pissed off
with him for a bit longer.

99
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,560
You should try rugby.

100
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,760
It's good for releasing negative emotions.

101
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,280

109
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,280
It feels like years since I was back here.

110
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,600
Are you sure you want
to go back to Truham?

111
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,200
Because you don't have to.

112
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,920
We could all pretend
to have sprained ankles, or something?

113
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,640
-
-All three of us?

114
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,920
What, did we have some sort
of group ankle-related accident?

115
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,960
Okay, I could have a sprained wrist,
or like a back injury or something.

116
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,480
-
-We can figure out the details.

117
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,480
No.

118
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,320
I…

119
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,920
I want to do this.

120
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,679
 Whoo!

121
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,720
Sports Day! Sports Day! Whoo-hoo!

122
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,360
Elle!

123
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,040
 Hi.

124
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,280
Oh, my God, it's literally like old times.

125
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,920
Don't say that. I thought I'd never have
to come back to this hell-hole.

126
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,600
We could go hide in the library.

127
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,960
I don't even want
to be here either, honestly.

128
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,720
I haven't signed up for an event.

129
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,240
If Ms. Singh catches me,
she's gonna force me to

130
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,000
do the high jump or something. Ugh.

131
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,040
Tao, it's fine. I'm fine.

132
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,360
Truham students, Higgs students.

133
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,880
Welcome to the day I know
you've all been waiting for,

134
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,400
Truham and Higgs Sports Day.

135
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,840
I'm sure that every single one of you
is ready to give it your all,

136
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,280
or at least I hope so

137
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,840
because if you haven't signed up
for an event…

138
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,920
-Hi!
-Hi!

139
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,760
-…Ms. Singh will murder you.
-

140
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,640
-Where's Charlie?
-Haven't seen him.

141
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,760
With the rugby team.

142
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,200
The match doesn't start
until the end of the day.

143
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,400
 She's just informed me
that she won't murder you.

144
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,040
But she might ban you from watching

145
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,440
the Reds versus Blues
rugby match later today,

146
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,840
an even worse fate, if you ask me.

147
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,840
So, good luck one and all,
and go do sports!

148
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,640
-Mr. Ajayi?
-Charlie.

149
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,720
There aren't any Sports Day events
going on in the Art block.

150
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,480
You'd better not be about to ask me
if you can stay in here all afternoon.

151
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,160
You've been coming in here
for lunch a lot recently.

152
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,840
We having a repeat of last year?

153
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,200
Isolating yourself, not talking to anyone?

154
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,800
No.

155
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,840
All right, I'm not going to make you go
because I'm a nice teacher.

156
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,000
When I was at school,

157
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,840
I thought that hiding
from it all was safer, easier.

158
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,840
But sometimes
the loneliness was just as bad.

159
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,960
Don't let anyone
make you disappear, Charlie.

160
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,400
Hmm?

161
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,560
 Tao Xu!

162
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,640
Oh, no.

163
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,040
You are the only Year 10
who has failed to sign up for an event.

164
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,120
Yes?

165
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,200
You'll be doing the 200 meters
for Team Blue.

166
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,760
You need to be
by the starting line in three minutes.

167
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,280
Wait! What?

168
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,200
No… No protests.

169
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,200
That's the only event with space left.

170
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,440
But, miss, I can't run.

171
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,680
He really can't.

172
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,280
-Can't you?
- Well, not…

173
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,560
Not fast.

174
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,040
 Hmm.

175
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,760
Swap bibs with me.

176
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,880
What? Why?

177
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,280
You hate running, I'll run it for you.

178
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,240
Thanks.

179
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,880
It's fine.

180
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,760
I'm just…

181
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,600
I'm just sorry.

182
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,000
 Year 10s and 11s
doing the 200-meters…

183
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,240
Sorry for everything.

184
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,240
…it's time to assemble
by the starting line.

185
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,720
I hope you've got your running shoes on.

186
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,880
 You obsessed with me or something?

187
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,280
 Starting positions, please!

188
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,760
On your marks!

189
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,040
Get set!

190
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,480
-I forgot he can run really fast.
-Come on!

191
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,040
 Whoo! Go, Charlie!

192
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,120
-Whoo!
-Whoo! Whoo!

193
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,160
You don't get to have
an opinion about anything I do.

194
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,520
You want me to go around
telling people about you and Nick?

195
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,560
Do you want me to go around telling people
about me and you?

196
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,560
That's what I thought.

197
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,360
Except, I wouldn't do that
because I'm a decent person.

198
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,840
I understand
that you're figuring out your sexuality,

199
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,440
but you don't get
to make me feel like crap anymore

200
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,200
just because you hate yourself.

201
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,920
So leave me alone.

202
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,600
Just leave me alone.

203
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,760
 Competitors for the
Year 11 high jump, it's your big moment.

204
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,360
Please put a spring in your step
and head to Ms. Singh.

205
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,400
-I'm so sorry--
-No, I'm sorry.

206
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,160
I should have been a better friend--

207
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,080
I shouldn't have gotten angry at you.

208
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,680
I made it so hard for you to tell me.

209
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,640
I should have been looking out for you
as much as you were looking out for me.

210
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,760
-Movie night on Saturday?
-Yeah.

211
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,160
I have a long list
of movies I need you to watch.

212
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,200
I'm probably going to hate most of them.

213
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,160
I know. 

214
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,120
Me and Elle were gonna go
exploring around all her old classrooms.

215
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,520
-Want to come?
-Nah.

216
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,760
You go, I'll be fine.

217
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,440
 Come on, Isaac!

218
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,760

233
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,600
- Didn't it take you four months?
-Yep. I was in here every lunchtime.

234
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,280
-Are you doing landscapes this year?
-Yeah.

235
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,400
Mine's really bad.

236
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,720
It's on the drying rack.

237
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,000
 Oh!

238
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,320
I know, it's bad.

239
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,000
 It's not, it's…
It's really not, it's just…

240
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,800
I don't think it counts
as a landscape if it has people in it.

241
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,520
Is it awful being at Truham without me?

242
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,800
Yes.

243
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,040
Everything's awful without you.

244
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,560
I'm okay now.

245
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I promise.

246
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,520
I was going to tell you something.

247
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,920
What?

248
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,320
You've got the wrong team's face paint on.

249
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,040
-That's Charlie's fault for swapping bibs.
-Just wipe the face paint off.

250
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,200
-Ah… Ow!
-

251
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,640
Okay, it's not coming off.

252
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,920
Come on. I want to go find my old locker.

253
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,240
 Now,
I know tensions are high,

254
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,840
but it's finally time
for you to sit back and watch

255
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:57,240
some teenagers crash into each other
and fall over repeatedly.

256
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,200
-
-That's right everyone,

257
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,520
the Red versus Blue rugby match
is about to begin.

258
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:09,040
Now, can someone explain
the rules of rugby to me again, please.

259
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,440
It seems to make no sense.

260
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,160
- One, two, three, Reds!
-Reds!

261
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,600
 Yes, boys, come on!

262
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,400
 Let's go play! Easy.

263
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,600
 You okay, Nick?

264
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,760
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

265
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,960
 Team Blue are doing pretty well.

266
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,760
Yeah, but Team Red has Nick Nelson,
so they're basically guaranteed to win.

267
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,480
 Nice work, Nick.

268
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,720
Come on, Nick.

269
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,680
Nick!

270
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,320
Sir, aren't you going to tell Nick
that he has to do the match?

271
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,200
Nah. I'm good.

272
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,600
I don't want to break up.

273
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,360
I know people have hurt you.

274
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,080
And you feel like I'd be
better off without you, but…

275
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,480
I need you to know that

276
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,480
my life is way better because I met you.

277
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,040
-You don't have to say that.
-I do.

278
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,600
And I'll keep on saying it
until you believe me.

279
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,520
Look, I don't care
about getting into fights

280
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,320
or pissing off my mates
or anything like that.

281
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,840
It's all worth it to be with you.

282
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:11,560
You are the kindest,
most thoughtful and caring

283
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,680
and amazing person in the whole world,

284
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,880
and if you really want to break up,

285
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,960
then I would respect your decision,
but I want us to be together.

286
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:21,880
Nick.

287
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,480
You're my favorite person,
I need you to believe me.

288
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,680
Nick.

289
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,480
I believe you.

290
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,240

Oh.

296
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,600
So what?

297
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,120
You free on Sunday?

298
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,600
Yeah. Why?

299
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,400
Now can you tell me where we're going?

300
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,520
No.

301
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,160
I don't think
I've ever been in this direction.

302
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,880
We're nearly there, I promise.

303
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,400
Wait…

304
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:33,960

 Oh, my God, the beach!

00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,240
You're such a dweeb.

315
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,040
I was thinking…

316
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,600
What if I came out?

317
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,520
Do you really want to?

318
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,240
I really want to.

319
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,320
I know I've been pretty unsure
of everything for a while,

320
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,040
but, like, I'm definitely bisexual.

321
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,520
And I don't want to have to sneak around
pretending we're platonic BFFs.

322
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,800
I'm not saying I want to have
a public announcement or anything, but…

323
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,640
I want to tell the people who matter.

324
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,600
And I want you
to be able to tell people too.

325
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,920
Oh, my God, I like you so much.

326
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,880
And I love liking you.

327
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,440
I like Charlie Spring
in a romantic way, not just a friend way!

328
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,360
What?

329
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,720
I never thought this would happen to me.

330
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,760
Me neither.

331
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,240
Nick?

332
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,320
Yeah?

333
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,160
Does this mean we're boyfriends?

334
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,800
Yes.

335
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,640
Was that not already established
the last ten times we made out?

336
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,120
Oh.

337
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,000
Yeah?

338
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,400
I don't know, we never,
like, confirmed it.

339
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,000
Why are we like this?

340
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,880
 Wha… Wha… What are you doing?

341
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,440
 There we go. Come on.

342
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,160
You're my boyfriend!

343
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,240
I'm your boyfriend! We're boyfriends!

344
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,000
-Don't you dare drop me!
-I won't drop you.

345
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,480
-Oh!
- Stop it!

346
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,800
Okay. I think we're wet enough now.

347
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,000
Okay.

348
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,440
 I'm home!

349
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,640
You look very smiley.
Have you had a good day?

350
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,360
Yeah. Yeah, it was really good.

351
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,240
-Mum.
-Mmm?

352
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,880
You know Charlie's my best friend?

353
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,480
If you're asking if he can come
on our holiday,

354
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,880
the answer's "no."

355
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,360
No, that's not what I was going to say.

356
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,920
He's my boyfriend.

357
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,400
Charlie's my boyfriend.

358
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,200
I… I still like girls, but, um…

359
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,560
We…

360
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,760
I like boys too.

361
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,800
 And me and Charlie, we're…

362
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,240
We're going out.

363
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,080
And I just…

364
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,120
wanted you to know.

365
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,680
Oh, baby.

366
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,760
Oh. 

367
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,640
Aw, thank you for telling me.

368
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,720
I'm sorry if I ever made you feel
like you couldn't tell me that.

369
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,040
You don't have to say
you like girls if you don't.

370
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,440
No, I, um…

371
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,080
It's definitely not just guys. I, um…

372
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,000
It's called bisexuality.

373
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,920
-If you've heard of that?
-I have heard of that.

374
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,600
I wasn't born in the 18th century.

375
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,440
How long have you known?

376
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,640
Well, um…

377
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,760
Me and Charlie started going out
a couple of months ago, but…

378
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,280
I started liking him way before that.

379
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,160
Oh, I love you.

380
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,120
Aw.

381
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,080

382
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,360
