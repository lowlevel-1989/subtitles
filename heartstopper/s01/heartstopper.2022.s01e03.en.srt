All right?

16
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,080
-How's it?
-It's fine. Normal.

17
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,760
Pleased for you, mate. 

18
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,800
So, uh, what's up?

19
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,760
-Here to talk about the party, mate.
-Party?

20
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,560
My sixteenth birthday party.

21
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,040
St. George's Hotel, this Saturday.
You're going to be there.

22
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,920
Uh… Yeah. Sounds good.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,320
You'd better bring some
cool people with you.

24
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,960
You going to invite me?

25
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,200
Um, only if you're
cool enough, apparently.

26
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,480
Um, do you not think
I'm cool, Nick Nelson?

27
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,320
Fine, I… I guess I can invite you, Imogen.

28
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,360
Yeah. Yeah, definitely.

29
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,479
 You know Tara Jones
is going to be there.

30
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,800
 Mate, she is fit.

31
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,800
Nick is going to
have his pick of two girls.

32
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,160
 Who's the other girl?

33
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,480
 Imogen, obviously.
Everybody knows she fancies him.

34
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,400
Hey, what?

35
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,200
Oh, um… Nothing.
We're talking about Tara Jones.

36
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,160
-She's going to be at Harry's party.
- What about her?

37
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,160
Thought you might be interested, mate.

38
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,720
Didn't you have some
childhood romance with her?

39
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,440
-
-We don't have a thing.

40
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,400
We just kissed at a party one time.

41
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,920
 Yeah, three years ago.

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,760
Nick's got a thing with Imogen now?

43
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,000
No, no, I don't.

44
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,080
He has two proper fit girls
trying to get with him,

45
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,600
and he's not even bothered.

46
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,720
If you're not into Imogen,

47
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,520
then Saturday night's
your chance with Tara.

48
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,720
That's all I'm saying.

49
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,080
Yeah. Maybe.

50
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,680
Hi.

51
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,280
Do you want to go to Harry's party?

52
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,040
With me.

53
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,200
Oh.

54
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,120
I…

55
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,600
I don't know. It doesn't sound like
my sort of thing.

56
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,680
Please come.

57
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,600
I want you to be there.

58
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,880
Okay.

59
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,360
Pick up at 10:00, okay?

60
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,160
Can't it be 11:00?

61
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,080
No, 10:00 is late enough.

62
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,080
Fine.

63
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,080
Charlie…

64
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,600
Yeah?

65
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,960
Call me if you need me, okay?

66
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,680

86

Mum, she's here to see me.

Mum.

00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,400
Okay, okay. In you come,
I'll put the kettle on.

93
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,560
-Okay.
-

94
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,640

she loves you more than me.

Moonlight?

 Moonlight's so sad,
I don't want to cry.

98
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,920
What about Arrival?

99
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,840
Oh, my God, that's even sadder.

100
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,120
Can't we just watch something funny?

101
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,000
-I thought we were having a film night.
-Yeah, a fun one.

102
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,240
I wanted it to be like old times.

103
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,040
Well, it's not old times anymore.

104
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,120
 Oh.

105
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,880
Just us then.

106
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,080
Just us.

107
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,240
I'm being serious.
I've never ever seen anyone.

108
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,040
I literally dragged my mum
to play Mario Kart--

109
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,640
Nicholas!

110
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,120
All right, mate.

111
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,280
Why are you hanging out in here?
It's a bit boring, innit?

112
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,720
We just are.

113
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,640
I've got important news for you.

114
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,560
Yeah, what?

115
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,040
Tara Jones is here.

116
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,680
-
- Hey!

117
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,720
So what?

118
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,640
So this is your big second chance, mate.

119
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,720
Let's make it happen. 

120
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,680
They kissed when they were 13.
Proper romantic.

121
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,840
-
-He should go for it, right?

122
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,720
-Come on, mate.
-Harry.

123
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,720
Come on. She's just down the corridor.

124
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,520
I haven't talked to her for years.

125
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,640
 So? She's super hot, man.

126
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,760
All right, ladies!

127
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,400
Hey, Tara, I've got someone
who wants to see you.

128
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,720
You remember Nick Nelson?

129
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,679
Uh… Yeah. Hi.

130
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,919
-Hi.
- How are you?

131
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,000
Charlie's changing.

132
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,200
What do you mean?

133
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,400
He's gone to rich-boy Harry's parties.

134
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,840
Last year he would have rather died
than go to one of those.

135
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,600
Well, I don't think he's there
to see Harry, to be honest.

136
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,720
Nick's stolen him.

137
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,600
That's a little dramatic.

138
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,200
It doesn't matter why he's there,

139
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,760
he should be with his actual friends.

140
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,360
I think Nick is his friend.

141
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,560
So you're on his side?

142
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:24,120
Tao, there aren't any sides.
Let's just stop talking about this.

143
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,040
Fine.

144
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,640
 Anyway, sorry about this.

145
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,960
I don't know why
my friends want to set us up.

146
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,520
Not that you're not, like, um, you know…

147
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,920
I don't really feel that way…

148
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,880
Nick, it's fine,
I don't feel that way about you either.

149
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,960
Yeah.

150
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,280
All of this could have
been avoided if I just…

151
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,680
What?

152
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,760
Told everyone I was a lesbian.

153
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,520
Well, yeah, um,

154
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,160
but that's not something
you'd want to lie about.

155
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,360
Wouldn't be a lie.

156
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,240
What?

157
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,440
-Oh. You actually are?
-

158
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,840
There's my girlfriend over there.

159
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,880
-We've mostly been keeping it quiet.
-Yeah.

160
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,840
So why are you telling me?

161
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,760
Me and Darcy have been talking,

162
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,240
and honestly, we feel like we don't
need to keep it that quiet anymore.

163
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,640
You mean, like, come out?

164
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,760
Not necessarily.

165
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,160
Um, we don't want to make
a big announcement, but…

166
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,480
Maybe just not hide so much.

167
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,280
That's cool.

168
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,760
I mean, I've only ever met
one openly gay person before.

169
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,240
Do you know Charlie Spring?

170
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,440
Yeah, I know of Charlie Spring.
Uh, are you friends?

171
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,720
Yeah, we sit next to each other in form.

172
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,120
He's probably…

173
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,760
Yeah, he probably is
my best friend right now.

174
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,800
Oh! 

175
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,080
Want to dance?

176
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,200
Yes, please.

177
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,120
Got to go.

178
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,240
Hey, look who's by himself.
Nick! Where you going?

179
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,080
I'm going to go find Charlie.

180
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,080
What, that nerdy little Year 10?

181
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,920
Why do you even hang out with him?

182
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,720
-He's my friend.
- But why?

183
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,800
Do you feel sorry for him 'cause he's gay?

184
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,040
What?

185
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,360
Oh, my God, no, wait, wait.

186
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,960
Do you think he has a crush on you?

187
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,560
Oh, my God, how sad.

188
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,200
That's homophobic, Harry.

189
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,080
 Come on, mate.

190
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,120
And I really don't like you.

191
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,360
Happy birthday.

192
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,400
Sorry I made tonight weird.

193
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,960
-You didn't.
-I did.

194
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,760
I just miss how things used to be.

195
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,880
With the four of us.

196
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,720
Yeah.

197
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,600
Well, sometimes change is a good thing.

198
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,320
Yeah.

199
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,400
That's true.

200
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,480
And Harry's party
probably isn't even that bad.

201
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,400
Some of my friends said that
they were going.

202
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,240
-Friends from Higgs?
-Yeah.

203
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,160
-You made some friends?
-Yeah, you jealous?

204
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,040
-No, no. I'm happy for you.
-

205
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,200
I was really scared
no one would like me, so…

206
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,240
I didn't even try
talking to people at first.

207
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:32,240
But then I realized I actually needed to
put myself out there or I'd just be alone.

208
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,600
So I think I'm going to be okay there.

209
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,920
At Higgs.

210
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,040
That's a good change, right?

211
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,320
Yeah. It's a good change.

212
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,760
Sorry.

213
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,000
Hey.

214
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,160
Charlie.

215
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,360
 Look, I'm sorry about what happened.

216
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,640
-Have you finished sulking about it?
-Leave me alone.

217
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,640
-Oh, come on.
-Do not touch me!

218
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,440
 I miss you guys though.

219
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,360
Yeah.

220
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,480
We miss you a lot too.

221
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,280
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

222
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,760
I kept buying your apple juice.

223
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,400
What?

224
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,320
I kept accidentally buying your
apple juice at the start of term.

225
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,560
Tao, that's so dumb. 

226
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,480
I know.

227
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,840
Can we promise that no matter what happens

228
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,880
we'll always prioritize our friendship?

229
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,920
Sounds a bit dramatic.

230
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,960
No, I'm serious.

231
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:20,200
Like, no matter what changes,
we always put our friendship first.

232
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,800
We'll still go bowling
and watch creepy documentaries,

233
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,760
and stay up to watch the Oscars.

234
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:29,280
And we'll always be able
to talk about deep stuff. Like this.

235
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,400
Promise.

Hi.

272
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,640
You left.

273
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,160
Sorry, I…

274
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,920
I felt like I was in the way.

275
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:09,119
And your Year 11 friends
are kind of intimidating.

276
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,520
Yeah.

277
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,720
I don't know if I want to hang out
with those guys anymore.

278
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,839
I'd rather hang out with you, anyway.

279
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,240
So, I just ran into Ben.

280
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,359
Ben?

281
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,839
Yeah.

282
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,200
I mean… I dealt with it.

283
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,920
He tried to, like,
apologize for what happened,

284
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,360
but I pushed him into a wall
and told him to go away.

285
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,920
I think he got the message this time.

286
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,360
-I'm so proud!
- Shut up.

287
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,280
It's kind of noisy in here, isn't it?

288
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,520
Yeah.

289
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,320
Shall we go somewhere quieter?

290
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,040
Okay.

291
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,280
 Come on.

292
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,000
You want to race?

293
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,200
You want to race me?

294
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,240
- No, no, no.
-You want to race?

295
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:14,920
Come on!

296
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,200
 Wait, stop!

297
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,120
You're going too fast!

298
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,880
Slow down!

299
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,040

304
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,120
Whoa!

305
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,320
- Yeah.
-How did Harry hire this entire place?

306
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,360
Oh, he's, like, extremely rich.

307
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,800
He should have gone on My Super Sweet 16.

308
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,600
So he could cry when his parents got him
the wrong color Lamborghini.

309
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,680
 Exactly.

310
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,400
So…

311
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,800
Was Harry being serious?

312
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,840
Do you like Tara?

313
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,040
What? No! No, definitely not.

314
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,440
Uh…

315
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,240
So you don't have
a crush on anyone at the moment?

316
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,120
Well…

317
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,880
I didn't say that.

318
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,480
Oh.

319
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,440
What's she like then?

320
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,480
You're just going to assume
they're a "she"?

321
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:49,920
Are they…

322
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,360
Are they not a girl?

323
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,040
Um…

324
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,320
Would you go out with someone
who wasn't a girl?

325
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,080
I don't know.

326
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,160
Maybe.

327
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,800
Would you kiss someone who wasn't a girl?

328
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,360
I don't know.

329
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,320
Would you kiss me?

330
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,720
Yeah.

331
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,200
You okay?

332
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,120
I…

333
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,440
 Nick, are you up here?

334
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,800
I just want to talk, mate.

335
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,400
Why are you hiding?

336
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,880
-
-

337
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,120
And like, it's all just banter, isn't it?

338
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,920
I mean, the lads can see it's banter.

339
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,200
You can see it's banter.

340
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,720
There's no need to start anything,

341
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,920
just 'cause you're in a bad mood
at my party.

342
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,840
Yeah.

343
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,600
Guess I was just in a mood.

344
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,280
Yeah. Exactly. 

345
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,480
So we're good?

346
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,280
Yeah.

347
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,680
Just going to go find the loo.

348
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,000
 Charlie.

349
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,520
Hey.

350
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,920
Hey, you okay?

351
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,640
It's okay.

352
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,640
It's okay.

353
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,160
It's okay. I've got you.

354
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,200
I got you.

355
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,760
Everything's going to be okay.

356
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,320
 Would you kiss me?

357
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,320
No.

358
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,520
 Charlie!
Can you get the door please?

359
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,920
