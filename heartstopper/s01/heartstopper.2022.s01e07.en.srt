-Jesus, Tori.
- What?

5
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,800
How do you just appear out of nowhere?

00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,360
Older sister magic.

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,000
Where are you going?

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,800
Nick's invited me to
the cinema with his friends.

9
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,040
 Oh.

10
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,280
Okay.

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,080
-What?
-No, nothing.

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,840
Glad Nick's such a nice… friend.

13
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,520
Well, yeah.

14
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,880
He is. But, um…

15
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,640
Actually, we're…
Me and Nick, we're kind of going out.

16
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,440
Called it.

17
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,760
You can't tell anyone.
He's not even out to his mom.

18
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,880
I know, I know.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,440
I'm happy for you.

20
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,000
You've liked him for ages.

21
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,360
Thanks.

22
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,800
-You're hanging out with his mates now?
-Yeah. Why?

23
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,720
I've seen them at parties and stuff.

24
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,080
They don't seem
that nice compared to Nick.

25
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,320
I'll be fine.

26
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,000
None of them know about you and Nick?

27
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,280
Obviously not.

28
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,200
Okay.

29
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,720
So is he your boyfriend?

30
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,560
We're not ready to label it yet,
we're just…

31
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,120
-You know.
-"You know."

32
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,240
 Shut up.

33
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,600
Well done. Your crush on him
was super embarrassing.

34
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,680
Go away.

35
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,120
 So, I was wondering

36
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,560
if you wanted to come over.

37
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,480
Just to hang out.

38
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,040
We hang out at school though.

39
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,080
Yeah, but…

40
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,280
I thought…

41
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,760
-since we're boyfriends…
-What?

42
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,240
We're not boyfriends.

43
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,120
Why would you think that?

44
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,640
-Pickup at 10:00, okay?
-Yep.

45
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,680
-Charlie.
-Yeah?

46
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,200
If any of those boys says anything,
does anything nasty,

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,760
you just call me, okay?

48
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,120
Nick's going to be there.

49
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,040
I'll be fine.

50
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,360
-Hi.
- Hi.

51
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,640
Um, are you sure your friends are going to
be okay with me being here?

52
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,720
Yeah, of course.

53
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,600
You'll be fine.
Ben and Harry aren't coming.

54
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,800
What, are you nervous?

55
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,920
I don't know.

56
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,640
They all probably think
I'm this, like, gay nerd.

57
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,840
Well, you kind of are a gay nerd.

58
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,560
 Shut up, rugby lad.

59
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,640
-All right. Look, Nick and his best mate.
-

60
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,720
- Why did he even bring him?
-Oh.

61
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,920
Oi. Just look at him
behind him. Like a little girl.

62
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,400
 Is he your mate, Ben?

63
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,520
Who, Charlie?

64
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,400
-Never even spoken to him.
-

65
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,000
 Why can't any of you
ever bring a girl with you?

66
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,120
Let's get popcorn.

67
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,720
Do you prefer sweet or salted?
Or we could get a mix of both.

68
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm not really hungry, to be honest.

69
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,440
You get some though.

70
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,600
Char…

71
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,400
Are you okay?

72
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,680
I honestly had no idea they'd be here.

73
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,080
I wouldn't have suggested
we come if I'd known.

74
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,120
Char?

75
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,120
Uh… Wow, that just slipped out.

76
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,560
Oh, my God, say it again.

77
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,360
-No. No.
-Go on.

78
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,200
I like it. It's cute.

79
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,400
Now I'm never calling you it again.

80
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,160
 Sorry.

81
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,840
-
-

82
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,960
You're a dork.

83
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,920
-
-

84
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,680
I can't believe what a wimp you are.

85
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,480
Uh, you jumped at all the scares too.

86
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,440
No, I jumped
when you screamed, that's all.

87
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,600
So, Charlie Spring, quick question.
What's it like being gay?

88
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,000
It's fine.

89
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,000
You don't seem that gay, to be honest.

90
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,400
You do sound sort of gay, but that's it.

91
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,120
-Do you like musicals?
-Harry, can you just piss off, please?

92
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,760
What sort of guys do you like then?

93
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,880
I don't know.

94
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,120
What about Harry Styles? He's pretty sexy.

95
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,880
-I guess.
-Just leave it.

96
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,160
What about Nick?

97
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,400
Do you think he's hot?

98
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,840
Are you joking?

99
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,920
-Nick's not even my type.
-

100
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,240
- You have a crush on him.
-No.

101
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,040
 You do.

102
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,800
Just stop.

103
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,240
Wow, take a joke, mate. 

104
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,560
My dad's here.

105
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,560
I have to go.

106
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,440
Charlie.

107
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,920
Hey.

108
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,440
Wait.

109
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,880
I'm so sorry.

110
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,680
-It's fine.
-No.

111
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,440
Harry was being a complete idiot

112
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,760
and some of the others
were being really unfriendly and…

113
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,600
-We should have just left.
-Nick.

114
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,040
I'm honestly used to it by now.

115
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,120
I'll see you at school.

116
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,080
Charlie.

117
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,480
I saw you holding hands with him.

118
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,680
In the cinema.

119
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,040
Are you going out with him then?

120
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,520
-No.
-But you are getting with him?

121
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,640
-No.
- Don't lie.

122
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,040
Well, I believe that
you're not going out with him.

123
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,720
As if anyone would ever want to go out
with someone as desperate as you.

124
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,280
-You did.
-Are you joking?

125
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,040
You actually thought I liked you?

126
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,720
You were there like some tragic loser
with barely any friends,

127
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,600
who ate lunch alone and let bullies
walk over you. I never liked you.

128
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,360
I'm not even gay.
I just felt really sorry for you.

129
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,160
Charlie.

130
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,760
Ready to go?

131
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,520
Yeah.

132
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,640
Are you okay?

133
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,760
-What was that about?
-Nothing.

134
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,640
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

135
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,800
Right.

136
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,120
Let's go home.

137
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,960
Go on then.
What's your problem with Charlie?

138
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,560
He doesn't exactly fit in
with us, does he?

139
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,920
He can't play rugby, he's got this
weird friend who won't leave me alone.

140
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,120
You can't just bring some gay boy
into our group

141
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,400
and expect us all to immediately love him.

142
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,159
So this is a problem with him being gay?

143
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,480
Come on, none of us are being homophobic.

144
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,000
Just shut up, Harry!

145
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,840
You made him so uncomfortable
with your gay questions.

146
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:48,159
Someone really needs to learn
to take a joke.

147
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,280
But you weren't joking though, were you?

148
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,760
You saw the perfect opportunity

149
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,720
to make someone feel
miserable and humiliated, as usual.

150
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,880
I'm sure he can deal with it.
He's probably used to it by now.

151
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,880
Aw. You're getting so angry.

152
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,360
You can't help wanting to
protect him, can you?

153
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,920
Because he's a pathetic little fag.

154
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,200
So are you going to tell me what happened?

155
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,200
There's not really anything to tell.

156
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,560
Oh, Nicky, come on, baby.

157
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,920
Harry was saying some
really nasty stuff about Charlie.

158
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,800
He's been really gross and mean
about him for ages, and I just…

159
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,840
I lost it.

160
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:44,840
I'm just so angry at myself for
not seeing that all my friends… suck.

161
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,880
Sweetheart, fighting is not the answer.

162
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,800
I know.

163
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,400
He just used a really bad word.

164
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,080
I see.

165
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,640
Charlie's a really special friend,
isn't he?

166
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,800
Yeah.

167
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,120

I know I'm attractive, mate.
There's no need to stare.

175
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,800
What happened to you?

176
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,520
Ask Nick Nelson.
He's got some serious anger issues.

177
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,960
-Did you have a fight?
-He can't seem to take a joke anymore.

178
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,080
You know I was only joking in the cinema?

179
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,080
Yet he starts fighting
when I've done nothing.

180
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,960
What's going on? You okay?

181
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,400
It's fine. Let's just go.

182
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,480
You all right, mate?
You want to fight too?

183
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,440
You clearly didn't get
hugged much as a child,

184
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,800
but if you're craving human contact
that badly, you could just say so.

185
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,840
Tao. Just leave it. Everything's fine.

186
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,520
Yeah, maybe listen to your boyfriend.

187
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,080
At least he knows his place.

188
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,160
Hi.

189
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,880
What happened?

190
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,320
Oh, uh…

191
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,240
Yeah. I kind of got into a fight.

192
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,800
With Harry.

193
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,840
After you left
and I went back to the group, he…

194
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,760
he started saying some…

195
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,160
things about you.

196
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,840
I just lost it.

197
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,680
And punched him, and… yeah.

198
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,560
Nick.

199
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,080
You didn't have to do that.

200
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,280
I promise,
I'm used to people saying stuff about me.

201
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,040
No, but you shouldn't have to be.

202
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,560
People shouldn't be saying stuff
about you in the first place.

203
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,360
You shouldn't have to put up
with anything like that.

204
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,200
-I'm sorry.
-No.

205
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,200
You're not allowed to say the "s" word.

206
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,200
I don't want to be friends
with those people anymore.

207
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,520
I don't expect you
to dump your friends for me.

208
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,880
Some of the rugby boys are nice.

209
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,880
Even they just… stood there.

210
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,720
I'm tired of all of them.

211
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:39,600

219
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,920
 I think it was my fault.

220
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,080
What was?

221
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,800
Harry picking on me and Charlie.

222
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,440
I knew this would happen.

223
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,480
I could handle it 'cause I can stick up
for myself, but Charlie can't.

224
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,640
So I've been like…

225
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,200
fighting back.

226
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,120
Fighting?

227
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,480
Verbally fighting back.

228
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,200
You know that'll make you both a target.

229
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,640
Yeah, I can see that now.

230
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,640
I just kept thinking about
how bad it was for Charlie last year.

231
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,000
I just made things worse.

232
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,320
Sorry.

233
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,240
I feel like I'm always off-loading
my problems onto you.

234
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,640
I mean, I did the same thing to you
in my last term at Truham,

235
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,920
so it's basically payback.

236
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,600
Harry just thinks
it's fun to pick on people.

237
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,440
He was in my maths class last year.

238
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,280
Did he ever say anything to you?

239
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,680
Yeah. Sometimes.

240
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,720
Surprise, he's transphobic as well.

241
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,480
You should have said something.
We could have told a teacher…

242
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,400
Yeah.

243
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,960
Maybe.

244
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,400
But it wasn't like he was the only one
saying stuff to me.

245
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,720
I'm not surprised
Nick started a fight with him.

246
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,040
If Harry was being a dick
to Charlie, of course.

247
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,840
Is there something going on
between Nick and Charlie?

248
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,560
There is, isn't there?

249
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,040
Yeah.

250
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,120
They're going out.

251
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,200
Who else knows?

252
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,560
Um…

253
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,600
Isaac, Tara and Darcy.

254
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,240
But Charlie wants to tell you himself.

255
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,680
Well, he said
he wanted to tell you himself.

256
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,160
When did he tell you?

257
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,720
At the milkshake cafe.

258
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,800
That was ages ago.

259
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,080
I feel so stupid.

260
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,640
I should go. My mum's probably waiting.

261
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,880
-Tao.
- See you later.

262
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,880
Wait.

263
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,840
- Hi.
- Elle, come in!

264
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,360
 How are you?

265
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,400
 Oh, what a surprise!

266
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,720
Hi.

267
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,160
Hi.

268
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,440
Uh, make sure you leave
the bedroom door open a tad, okay?

269
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,800
-What are you doing here?
-Um…

270
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,760
Want to eat cookies and watch a film?

271
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,360
Is it… a potato?

272
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,960
It's supposed to be a shoe.

273
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,720
Oh.

274
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,040
Look, we all know
me taking Art GCSE was a mistake.

275
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,040
It's fixable. Here.

276
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,320
See? That's better.

277
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,120
Thanks. I'll treasure
this shoe-potato always.

278
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,240
Sorry about earlier.

279
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,640
I know it's not your fault
he hasn't told me.

280
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,240
Charlie does want to tell you.

281
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,600
I think I know why he hasn't.

282
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,360
He thinks I'll say something stupid
and out Nick to all of Nick's mates.

283
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,600
And obviously he cares more
about Nick's feelings than mine.

284
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,640
Once you get into a relationship,
friendships don't matter anymore.

285
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,640
Or maybe he thinks
you'll force Nick to watch Donnie Darko

286
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,560
like you did with us.

287
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,400
Shut up, it's a good movie.
It's just complicated.

288
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,120
I don't know why
I'm so afraid of being alone.

289
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,000
That's how I felt.

290
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,520
My first term.

291
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,640
I got scared.

292
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,880
Everything turned out okay.

293
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,720
Hey.

294
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,680
You okay?

295
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,320
Um…

296
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,280
All right, mate?

297
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,440
Not in the mood for that fight, then?

298
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,280
Only if it's in the form of a board game
or a cake-eating contest.

299
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,320
-
- What's he on about?

300
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,480
-What's this?
-Hey.

301
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,840
Tao and Elle? Who's Elle?

302
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,840
Just give it back.

303
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,800
-Aw! Did your girlfriend draw it?
-Just give it back now.

304
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,080
Come and get it.

305
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,440
Oi, lads, look at this.

306
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,560
I hate you!

307
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,560
You're going to regret that!

308
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,920
So I was thinking

309
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,960
about me and you.

310
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,320
Okay.

311
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,960
And I just think…

312
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,680
The fight with Harry was my fault.

313
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,600
-It wasn't though.
-It was.

314
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,120
It was my fault.

315
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,400
Becoming friends with you and,
you know, everything that's happened.

316
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,480
I've been making your life
really difficult.

317
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,560
So I was thinking…

318
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,280
maybe it would be better if…

319
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,920
if we just…

320
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,160
Um…

321
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,560

 Why didn't you
tell me about you and Nick?

331
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,640
What?

332
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,480
I thought we were friends,
