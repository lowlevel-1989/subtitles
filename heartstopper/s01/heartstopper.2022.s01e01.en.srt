Ben?

17
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,760
Oh.

18
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,760
Happy New Year, Truham boys.

19
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,160
Uh, don't forget there'll now be
students from all school years

20
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,960
in your new form groups.
I hope you enjoy getting to know

21
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,000
some fresh faces in registration each day.

22
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,760
Oh! If it isn't Charlie Spring.
Happy New Year.

23
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,720
Hi, sir.

24
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,320
Come to join Hamlet House?

25
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,520
Apparently so.

26
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,640
Where did I put you on the seating plan?

27
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,320
Ah, yes, you're over there.

28
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,600
Next to Nicholas Nelson.

29
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,280
He's in Year 11,
so only one year older than you.

30
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,040
One of the rugby boys too, I think.
I'm sure you'll get along swimmingly.

31
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,880
Or you can just sit in silence
for the rest of the year.

32
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,280
It really doesn't affect me
in any way whatsoever.

33
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,240
Hi.

34
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,440
Hi.

35
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,960
Hey.

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,080
-Sorry about earlier.
-It's fine.

37
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,720
I missed your face so much.

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,320
Really? Did you have a good Christmas?

39
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,360
Yeah.

40
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,440
Yeah, it was all right. You?

41
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,880
Yeah. Yeah, it was good. Um…

42
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,360
My whole family was around
on Christmas day and then…

43
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,840
You're so cute.

44
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,360
Okay.

45
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,560
See you later then, yeah?

46
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,480
-Still don't tell anyone about this.
-Oh. Um…

47
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,560
Bye.

48
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,000
-Hi.
-Hi.

49
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,400
-Hi.
-Hi.

50
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,880
-Hi.
-Hi.

51
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,880
-Hi.
-Hi.

52
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,480
-Are you going that way?
-Yeah. Maths.

53
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,400
Same.

54
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,320
Are you literally doing your homework
while walking to your lesson?

55
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,880
I might be.

56
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,320
That's very chaotic.

57
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,560
That makes me sound way cooler
than I actually am.

58
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,720
Do you want me to do that for you?

59
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,000
-No, I'm good.
-I can tell you the answer.

60
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,240
Then I won't learn.

61
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,120
If you're stuck I can just… Let me just…

62
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,279
Get off.

63
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,040
-How dare you?
-Look…

64
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,920
Better?

65
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,200
Maybe.

66
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,840
Hey.

67
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,760
What?

68
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,440
Uh…

69
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,960
Just, "hi."

70
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,640
 Why are you talking to me?
I don't know who you are.

71
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,200
All right, mate?

72
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,120
Yeah, all right.

73
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,040
Yeah.

74
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,960
You're friends with Ben?

75
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,880
Uh, yeah. He's in my year.

76
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,680
We hang out sometimes.

77
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,520
Oh.

78
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,200
I did it again.

79
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,240
I bought Elle's drink. Again.

80
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,760
-Didn't you do that yesterday?
-Yes, Isaac. Yes, I did.

81
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,680
And on Monday.

82
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,400
-Elle's not here.
- I know.

83
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,360
-She's not been here all week.
-I know. I keep forgetting.

84
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,360
Tao, you're allowed to miss her.

85
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,760
 Okay, fine.

86
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,520
It's better that
she's at an all-girls school.

87
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,240
Mr. Reed was still refusing
to call her Elle.

88
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,400
Yeah. Mr. Reed's a massive transphobe.

89
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,760
 It's still weird though.

90
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,240
There used to be four of us,
now there's three.

91
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,040
Like, four is a group.

92
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,720
Three is just a… trio.

93
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,520
Isn't that Nick Nelson?

94
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,800
The guy you sit next to in form?

95
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,160
-Who?
- He looks like a golden retriever.

96
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,320
 He doesn't look
like a golden retriever.

97
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,120
 Okay, he does.

98
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,560
I can't believe you've been sat next to
rugby king Nick Nelson.

99
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,400
What are you going to talk about?

100
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,880
-We talked.
-Really?

101
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,960
About what?

102
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,680
Charlie, you don't have a tissue, do you?

103
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,400
My pen just, uh, exploded.

104
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,920
- It's not coming off.
- You're gonna be blue forever.

105
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,720
Looks like I'm wearing blue gloves!

106
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,720
You can make it the new school fashion.

107
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,280
Or I'll pretend it's a tattoo.

108
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,480
Well, be careful.

109
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,520
-What? Why?
- Why? Look at them.

110
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,720
-
-Look at us.

111
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,120
We are a group.
No, a trio of borderline outcasts.

112
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,240
He is the star player on the rugby team,

113
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,800
and he's friends
with a bunch of loud, gross Year 11s

114
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,840
who are like the guys
who bullied you last year.

115
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,120
But like…

116
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,320
Nick…

117
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,680
He's different. He's nice.

118
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:00,320
I bet he's a whole different person
when he's with his bro dude friends.

119
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,240
 Lunch ends in five minutes, girls.

120
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,280
Is that a phone, Elle?

121
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,040
Well?

122
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,920
 Um…

123
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,320
Yeah.

124
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,200
We don't make exceptions,
even for new students.

125
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,560
You can have this back from reception
at the end of the day.

126
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,320
 You know I'm sorry
about ignoring you yesterday.

127
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,760
Yeah.

128
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,720
 It's quite a while
since you've hidden in here at lunch.

129
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,680
I'm not hiding.

130
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,200
Then what are you doing?

131
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,440
-Eating lunch.
-Oh, right.

132
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,600
So everything's okay?

133
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,000
No bullies I need to sort out again?

134
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,640
No. Everything's fine.

135
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,640
Actually, there is kind of someone.

136
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,160
A bully?

137
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,960
I've… I've got a boyfriend.

138
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,640
Ah. Well, congratulations.

139
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,280
Not…

140
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,240
It's…

141
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,840
-Okay…
-I don't even know if…

142
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,680
I don't think he even thinks
we're boyfriends anyway.

143
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,360
He ignores me sometimes.

144
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,280
He doesn't even like people seeing us
talk to each other in the corridors.

145
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,480
He pretends like he doesn't know who I am.

146
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,280
 But then
when it's just us two he's fine.

147
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,240
Well, have you talked to him
about how that makes you feel?

148
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,280
No.

149
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,160
Maybe you should talk to him then?

150
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,880
What do you want me to say?
Break up with him?

151
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,880
- I don't know.
-Well, do you want to break up with him?

152
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,200
I don't know.

153
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,480
I can't solve your problems
for you, Charlie.

154
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,920
What about your friends,
have you talked to them about it?

155
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,600
-They wouldn't get it.
-Why not?

156
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,640
Because they're not gay.

157
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,440
Just talk to him.

158
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,400
It's better to be honest in the long run.

159
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,320
I hate being honest.

160
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,520
I know. It took you three months
to tell me you were being bullied.

161
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,840
Yeah.

162
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,040
 Well, I'm being serious.

163
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,160
-I'd never lie to you, don't worry.
-Okay.

164
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,960
-We will. If you're nice.
-Never mind then.

165
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,240
It's okay.

166
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,440
-Morning.
-Jesus, Tori.

167
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,640
Why's your face like that?

168
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,440
I broke up with my boyfriend.

169
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,560
Was he a knob?

170
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,480
Yes.

171
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,520
Well done, then.

172
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,480
Hypothetically, what sort of boy
do you want to go out with?

173
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,240
One who doesn't mind people seeing us
talk to each other would be nice.

174
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,680
Someone who's also a nerd,

175
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,720
or do you want
an "opposites attract" thing?

176
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,400
I don't think I can afford to
be that specific, to be honest.

177
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,600
Hypothetically though. Dream guy.

178
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,880
I don't know.

179
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,160
Come on.

180
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,600
I don't know, just…

181
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,240
Just someone I can have a laugh with.

182
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,680
And… and who's nice.

183
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,880
And kind.

184
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,120
And likes being with me.

185
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,360
I'd probably just settle for someone tall.

We've been doing this all term
and no one's beaten Charlie's time yet.

190
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,760
Come on! Yes!

191
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,720
Keep it moving!

192
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,720

Hey.

199
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,720
Thanks.

200
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,360
You play the drums?

201
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,920
Yeah.

202
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,200
That's so cool.

203
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,360
Thanks.

204
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,760
So, um, I had something
I wanted to ask you.

205
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:20,120
Charlie… I wanted to tell you
that I'm gay too.

206
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,800
And I'm in love with you.

207
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,640
Do you want to go out with me?

208
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,400
I want to be with you forever.

209
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,680
Do you want to join the rugby team?

210
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,080
What?

211
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,760
We have enough players for the team

212
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,880
but we're not allowed to actually play
against other teams without a reserve.

213
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,680
And I saw you run in PE
and you're, like, really fast.

214
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,640
So… I thought you might be interested.

215
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,400
I don't really know how to play.

216
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,520
That's fine. I can teach you.

217
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:52,160
Aren't I a bit small and weak
to be a rugby player?

218
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,320
We're just a school team, you know.
It's not that serious.

219
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,480
So you're saying I am small and weak?

220
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,640
Wait, no. No.

221
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,560
 Um…

222
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,560
So, do you want to join?

223
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,120
It's literally just another silly crush.

224
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,520
It's not a crush. I don't just fall for
any guy who's nice to me.

225
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,640
And you're sure
you want to spend a whole hour

226
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,880
-with giant, moronic, rugby lads?
-Yes.

227
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,120
It's your funeral.

228
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,760
 Charlie Spring though?

229
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,000
- Isn't he in Year 8?
- No. Year 10.

230
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,840
 He's, like, well skinny though.

231
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,440
 Can he even play?

232
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,920
I'm sure he's a nice guy
but we actually want to be dece.

233
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,680
 Does he even like sports?

234
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,000
Everyone knows he's gay.

235
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,280
Hi.

236
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,680
Hi.

237
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,640
I know I was joking about being weak,
but I'm definitely too weak for this.

238
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,560
Where is your "can do" attitude?

239
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,200
She left. Long ago.

240
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,280
Just try. Tackle me, I won't dodge.

241
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,120
Come on, I bet you can do it.

242
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,440
That was perfect.

243
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,520
-Was it?
-Yeah.

244
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,400
Now, let's try again
while I'm actually moving.

245
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,280
Come on.

246
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,520
I'm going to die.

247
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,320
 Go over the top!

248
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,200
Nick, Nick.

249
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,200
 One, two, three, squeeze!

250
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,960
One, two, three, squeeze!

251
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,120
Yeah, you got it. One more time, come on.

252
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,280
Come on, this time, Charlie!

253
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,880
One, two, three, squeeze!
One, two, three, squeeze!

254
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,000
 Come on, mate. We've got practice.

255
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,119
Don't die.

256
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,280
 Bye.

257
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:20,079
-I'm trying to score a try.
-Yeah.

258
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,880
And you try and run up to me.

00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,880

You're wearing a coat? It's not even cold.

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,880
It's February.

276
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,320
 Lame.

277
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,120
What do you want, Ben?

278
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,800
Don't touch me.

279
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,920
God, what's your problem?
I'm trying to be nice.

280
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,800
I said I don't want to meet up anymore.

281
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,920
-Yeah, and I don't believe you.
-What?

282
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,240
You're clearly just scared
of getting caught.

283
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,320
Why would I be scared of getting caught?

284
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,320
Everyone in school already knows I'm gay.

285
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,320
You're the one
who's scared of getting caught.

286
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,120
You can't even look at me
when other people are around.

287
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,160
Not to mention the fact
that you have a girlfriend.

288
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,520
Yeah. I've seen you
with her at the school gate.

289
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,920
Thanks for telling me.

290
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,760
Oh, wait, you didn't.

291
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,960
Don't be angry at me
for not wanting to come out yet.

292
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,320
I'm not angry about that.

293
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,920
If you're figuring stuff out, fine.
Take your time.

294
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,840
I would have been there for you.

295
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,400
Don't you think I would understand
you're figuring out your sexuality?

296
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,720
Then why are you angry at me?

297
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,200
I'm angry because you never
even slightly cared about my feelings.

298
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,240
We only ever meet up when you want to.

299
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,280
Where you want to.
When you feel like kissing a boy.

300
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,960
You don't care about me at all.

301
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,440
It's not like anyone else is
going to want to go out with you, is it?

302
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,720
- Don't.
-Charlie.

303
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,520
-I know you like me.
- Stop it!

304
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,680
Charlie, I like you
but I'm figuring stuff out.

305
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,280
What more do you want from me?

306
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,520
He told you to stop. 

307
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,400
Go on. Piss off.

308
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,240
You okay?

309
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,560
Did you hear all of that?

310
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,000
Most of it.

311
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,240
I just…

312
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,520
You seemed kind of like something was up
while we were getting changed, so I…

313
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,520
I wanted to check everything was okay.

314
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,520
I'm sorry.

315
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,480
You have nothing to be sorry about.

316
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,120
Sorry.

317
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,520
You say sorry a lot.

318
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,480
Don't say it.

319
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,480
-I kind of want to say it.
- Don't.

320
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,920
 We should get out.

321
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,400
We'll get locked in
if we stay here much longer.

322
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,320
 Yeah.

323
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,120
I'm going this way, so…

324
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,280
Yeah, I'm that way.

325
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,000
Okay. Bye.

326
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,680
