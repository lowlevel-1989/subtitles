for a dinner party.

72
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,160
Well, maybe this will help her
see how great he is.

73
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,600
 Year 11 Prom's coming up.

74
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,800
- How are you feeling about it?
-Good.

75
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,120
-Just, like, maybe a gray?
-Okay.

76
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,520
Guys! Um, I'm gonna
catch up with you in a bit.

77
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,120
-I said I'd meet up with James.
-Oh my God, they're gonna kiss!

00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,280
-Good luck!
-Have fun.

00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,320
-Bye!
-Bye.

80
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,560
 With this?

81
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,760
 For prom!

82
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,880
-No.
-Yes!

83
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,080
I don't know. Maybe?

84
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,760
Try it on. Look,
the lining matches my dress. It's perfect.

85
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,240
Okay.

86
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,320
-Yes! Go!
-All right. Okay!

87
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,720
I think I'm gonna go to prom.

88
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,280
-Yeah?
- Yeah.

89
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,480
Um…

90
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,080
Would you like to, like, um,

91
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,680
be my prom date?

92
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,520
Really?

93
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,080
-I don't know. Maybe it's stupid.
-No.

94
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,800
No, it's not.

95
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,320
We might get a lot of attention.

96
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,080
-And I don't wanna wear matching suits.
-Oh, me neither.

97
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,000
Good.

98
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,760
Good.

99
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,160
-This one's pretty.
- Mm.

100
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,760
I don't think it's the one.

101
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,400
What's the deal
with this exhibition thing anyway?

102
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:04,440
They like your art enough to exhibit it
but still can't tell you if you've got in?

103
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,680
You got in, didn't you?

104
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,840
-
-Sh!

105
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,120
Don't tell the others.

106
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,680
 Oh no, there's a bit missing.

107
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,000
 I don't know how Tao will take it.

108
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,680
I just haven't decided yet.

109
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,360
Okay.

110
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,080
Ta-da!

111
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,680
Oh my God! You look amazing.

112
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,600
I don't know if I can afford it.
I haven't got much left after Paris, but…

113
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,560
- I've got some change.
-Oh my God.

114
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,120
-You look amazing.
- Like it?

115
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,200
-Seven?
-I've got some.

116
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,240
 No, guys…

117
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,640
-Oh, wait.
- I've got seven.

118
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,160
 I've got £6.50.

119
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,080
There we go.

120
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,640
-That's enough.
-Take it.

121
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,880
Thank you.

122
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,360
Hey. Sorry. Some man just bought, like,
15 of those Penguin cloth-bound classics.

123
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,080
-
-Wow. That's, like, life goals.

124
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,200
So I'm guessing
you don't feel the same about me then?

125
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,520
I don't know how I'm supposed to feel

126
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,080
when I have a crush on someone.

127
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,160
I read all these books
where people fall in love,

128
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,000
and I still have absolutely no idea.

129
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:38,200
I thought that I might
feel that way about you.

130
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,120
But then we kissed, and

131
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,760
I just knew that I didn't.

132
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,760
I think there might be
something wrong with me.

133
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,000
There's nothing wrong with you.

134
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,360
You probably just haven't found
the right person yet.

135
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,200
Yeah.

136
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,080
 If we don't get "best dressed"--

137
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,960
 Are we going for that?
Is that real?

138
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,120
They wanted to wrap it.

139
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,960
-Did something happen?
-Something definitely happened.

140
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,760
-Did you kiss?
-Can you guys just shut up?!

141
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,760
I get that you don't think
my life is interesting

142
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,760
unless I have some kind of romantic drama,

143
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,360
but I'm sorry to break it to you.
I don't like him back!

144
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,600
Okay? You can all carry on
with your day now.

145
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,280
-Isaac--
-No, I'm sorry. I'm fine. I just…

146
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,280
I don't wanna talk about it.

147
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,480

154

-How are you?
- Nervous.

00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,680
Don't be nervous.

I love it.

What's it about?

182
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,160
Basically about my experience
being aromantic and asexual.

183
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:43,120
Like, being in a world where romance
and sex are prized above everything else

184
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,720
when you don't feel
those forms of attraction.

185
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,440
Growing up feeling
that something about you is different,

186
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,120
but you don't have the words
to describe what that is.

187
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,520
But then,

188
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,680
freedom.

189
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,880

from those pressures and expectations.

- No.

All will be revealed.

196
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,920
She's so moody.

197
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,480
I already told her I'd leave early.

198
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,920
Literally nothing I ever do
is good enough.

199
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,720
- Hey, Sahar.
-You okay?

200
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,640
- Yeah. You look cool.
-Sahar! I didn't know you were coming.

201
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,320
Yeah, Elle's my friend.

202
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,640
So you guys can't tease me
about being the token ally anymore

203
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,160
now that Sahar's here.

204
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,160
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm bisexual.

205
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,920
So… 

206
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,720
- Sahar, I didn't know…
-Interesting.

207
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,040
I should probably leave.

208
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,280
But you'll miss Elle's painting.

209
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,560
If I leave it any longer,
it'll make her more angry.

210
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,400
Okay.

211
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,720
Well, are you still coming
to prom tomorrow?

212
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,520
Of course. We've got our matching outfits.

213
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,120
We're gonna slow dance
to some cheesy song.

214
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,520
Yeah? I'm gonna hold you to that.

for coming along tonight to celebrate
the incredible queer and trans artists

220
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,200
we have here at the Lambert School!

221
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:51,120
It's my great pleasure
to introduce Elle Argent,

222
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:56,040
who will be joining us in September
for her sixth-form studies.

223
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,080
Now, before the big reveal,

224
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,560
Elle, would you like to say a few words
about your piece?

225
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,680
-Okay.
-

226
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,680
So, there have been a lot of changes
in my life over the last couple of years,

227
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,000
but, with this piece,

228
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,080
I guess I wanted to capture a place
that holds a lot of happy memories.

229
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,640
Even in the darker times.

230
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,240
Somewhere I always felt… safe.

231
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,080
 Oh, that was beautiful.
Let's have a look. One, two, three!

232
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,840
-Oh my God.
-Wow.

233
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,240
- It's beautiful!
- Oh my God!

234
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Congratulations!

235
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,720
-Come here, you.
-Oh my God!

236
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,320
-I'm glad you liked it.
-I really liked it. It was amazing.

237
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,840
As usual.

238
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,680
I know you're probably annoyed
that I didn't tell you I got in.

239
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,440
I'm not annoyed.

240
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,000
Really?

241
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,520
Please don't base your decisions
on how I feel.

242
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,800
All I care about is you being happy, and

243
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,760
wherever you are,
I'll still want to be with you.

244
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,120
Okay.

245
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,720
But I also still haven't decided yet.

246
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,840
I may still stay at Higgs.

But, yeah, Elle's is,
like, in a different league.

253
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,400
- It was.
- Ridiculous.

254
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,520
Hey.

255
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,760
What are you doing here?

256
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,880
-I n… I need to talk to you.
-There's nothing to talk about.

257
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,080
I just want to apologize.

258
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,400
Properly.

259
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,160
Please, just hear me out.

260
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,520
I'm not going back to Truham
for sixth form,

261
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,040
so if you really hate me after this,
you'll never see me again.

262
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,120
Go on then.

263
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,320
I'm a messed-up person, Charlie.

264
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,840
I liked you.

265
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,320
You know that, don't you?

266
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:50,240
I know I was a piece of shit,
but I really liked you.

267
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,760
If I'd just had more time…

268
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,760
I want to be like you two, but…

269
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,440
my parents would never accept
who I really am.

270
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,880
I'm sorry, for everything.

271
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:06,960
I just

272
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,880
wanted something good.

273
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,040
You were something good.

274
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,440
Do you remember
the first time you kissed me?

275
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,360
You didn't even ask.

276
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,960
You didn't pause
to wonder whether it was what I wanted,

277
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,960
and I went along with it
because I had a crush,

278
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,640
and I didn't know any better.

279
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,880
I didn't realize
that you had all the control.

280
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,800
When I eventually did realize, I thought…

281
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,640
"This must be what I deserve."

282
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,960
Someone taking whatever he wants from me
whenever he wants.

283
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,480
Treating me like I'm nothing
the rest of the time.

284
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,400
Now, whenever anything good
happens in my life,

285
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,600
there's a voice in the back of my mind
telling me I'm worthless

286
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,040
and that I don't deserve it.

287
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,040
And now you want me to forgive you
so you can feel better about yourself?

288
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,000
I'm glad you realize
what you did was wrong,

289
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,840
but you don't get to ambush me
into forgiving you.

290
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,720
"Sorry" doesn't make up
for everything you did to me.

291
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:27,080
I really hope you become a better person
so you don't hurt anyone else.

292
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,840
But I don't wanna be there
to see that happen.

293
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,960
I don't wanna see you ever again.

294
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,360
 Come on! Come on! Come on! Yes!

295
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,280
 Go on! 

296
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,920
What are you doing?

297
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,080
 Do we need to pretend
to be platonic BFFs in front of your dad?

298
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,000
I mean…

299
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,520
Yeah, maybe just for now,
but I'm gonna tell him about us tonight.

300
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,680
 You can do it.

301
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,040
I'm here for you…

302
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,000
 …mate.

303
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,400
- Come on!
-You did not just call me "mate."

304
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,560
Pal.

305
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,920
Bro.

306
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,200
-Supportive straight friend?
-Charlie!

307
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,600
-Dad, we're home.
- Ah, Nick! 

308
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,760
 And your friend, um…

309
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,360
-Charlie.
- Yeah, Charlie.

310
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,760
Good to see you again.

311
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:56,080
You guys should come and join us.
Look, it's Toulouse and Montpellier.

312
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,800
Look at that. Look at that.

313
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,840
Right, let's go. See, I told you.

314
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,760
-Come on.
-I told you.

315
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,320
-Come on, come on! Whoa!
- Oi!

316
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,560
- Shall I lay the table, Sarah?
-Oh, you are a good boy.

317
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,560
- Oh!
- Oh, ay-ay-ay.

318
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,360
-How's it been since he got here?
-It's been fine.

319
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,480
-It's been fine.
- Ahh! Yeah!

320
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,480
He doesn't have to know, sweetheart.

321
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,240
He's got no right to know.
You don't owe him a thing.

322
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,760
- Oh!
- Oh, ay-ay-ay.

323
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,840
 No, no, no.

324
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,360
I'm not doing it for him.
I'm doing it for me.

325
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,000
-
- Wah!

326
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,080
-Hi! Hello. Thank you for coming.
- Hi.

327
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,680
I grew up
in the south of France. Near Narbonne.

328
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,480
Ah, yeah, yeah. Very near Spain.

329
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,840
My father's from the south of Spain.
Almería.

330
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,840
 Oh yeah.

331
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,400
-But your surname, it's so English.
- Yeah, well…

332
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:53,240
Um… He always said that we had a rather
complicated family tree. 

333
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,880
- It's a long story.
- Yeah.

334
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,000
-Do you visit often, Stéphane?
-As much as I can.

335
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,680
My job, it keeps me very busy.

336
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,200
I'm in property development.

337
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,760
You should see
some of the places Dad renovates. Insane.

338
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,640
 Work isn't everything,
you know?

339
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,960
Although the pay does help.

340
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,480
Dad, has Nick told you how he met Charlie?

341
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,840
 No, he hasn't.

342
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:25,160
Um… We got sat together in school,
and then Charlie joined the rugby team.

343
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,880
Oh. You play rugby, Charlie?

344
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,880
 I'm not very good.

345
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,000
 Mm.

346
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,760
And Nick was obsessed
with getting Charlie to join.

347
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,360
Wonder why.

348
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,320
-What is your problem?
-I played rugby when I was in university.

349
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,080
It's a very attractive sport to women.

350
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,040
Have neither of you boys
found girlfriends?

351
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,520
No. I guess not.

352
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,440
 Ah, well, there's still time.

353
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,880
 I'm not sure Nick's too interested
in looking for girlfriends, really.

354
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,360
Don't you dare.

355
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,120
David, be respectful,
please, at the table. We have guests.

356
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,120
-Why do you always do this?
-I'm just trying to help.

357
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,520
Sorry. This is ridiculous.

358
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,360
Dad,

359
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,680
Charlie's my boyfriend.

360
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,160
Surprise.

361
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,520
I'm bi, he's gay,

362
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,680
and I was actually really stressed out
about how I was gonna tell you,

363
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,920
but you know what?

364
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,960
I don't care
what you think about it anymore.

365
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,040
'Cause you don't care to even see us
more than two times a year.

366
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,520
And, you know, every time I do see you,
I always think, "This is it."

367
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,880
"This is the time when you might actually
take an interest in my life," but…

368
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,760
you never do.

369
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,640
So if you don't care, then…


370
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,560
…then I don't care either.

371
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,200
And I don't know why
you're acting like you are ten years old,

372
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,120
but your bullying just doesn't affect me
anymore because, quite simply,

373
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,680
I do not care.

374
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,960
I like who I am. I like my life.

375
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,200
-Maybe stay with Dad next time.
-

376
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,640
Sorry, Mum.

377
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,680
Just gonna let him speak to us like that?

378
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,600
Oh, David, be quiet.
We've heard quite enough.

379
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,080
It's Nick that's making a scene.

380
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,480
He's always causing a fuss.

381
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,280
Dad agrees.

382
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,240
You have not grown up into the man
I had hoped you would be, David.

383
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,680
As if you have any right to say that.
You barely see your children.

384
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,480
- I can't say something?
-No, you can't say anything.

385
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,840
You haven't earned that right.
You haven't been a parent.

386
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,680
- We're not going…
-Are you okay?

387
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,200
 We're going through this
because you never hear it.

388
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,200
I actually think I am.

389
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,160
I didn't mean for it
to happen that way, but, um…

390
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,000
it felt good to say it.

391
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,200
Do you want a hug anyway?

392
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,520
Well, that went well.

393
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,440
-Sorry.
-No, I'm pleased you said what you said.

394
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,400
Especially to your dad.
He needed to hear it.

395
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,160
He's not a very good dad, is he?

396
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,640
No, he's not.

397
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,080
Wh…

398
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,160
Why doesn't he care?

399
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,080
I wish I understood, but I don't.

400
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,240
I think it's a very sad way to exist.

401
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,360
 Leaving then?

402
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,280
Yeah.

403
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,640
Nick, uh…

404
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,200
I'm sorry.

405
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,480
I… I… I want to be better.

406
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,280
Well… show it then.

407
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,040
Don't just say it.

408
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,280
 Dad.

409
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,360
-You… You're going?
- Yeah.

410
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,520
Got to head into London
before it gets too late.

411
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:20,080
But call me
when you get back to Edinburgh, huh?

412
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,480
Glasgow.

413
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Oh, yeah, Glasgow. Yeah. 

414
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,600
It was nice to meet your… boyfriend.

415
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,000
Well, I… I… I don't really
understand these things, but

416
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,320
he seems like a very nice young man.

417
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,800
He is.

418
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,120
Bye, Dad.

419
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,120
Yeah. Well…

420
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:20,400
 It's so cringe. He's made
such a big deal out of telling our dad.

421
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,800
 Such an attention seeker.

422
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:28,120
Ah, probably his drama-queen
boyfriend's influence.

423
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,360
Yeah. Mate, well, exactly. That's it.

424
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,080
You are a pathetic little man.

425
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,360
Talk about my brother like that again,

426
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,200
and I'll end you.

427
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:56,040
-Really sorry about all the drama.
-We are used to drama in our house.

428
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:56,960
Yeah.

429
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,440
It takes a lot
for Nick to stand up to David like that.

430
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,240
He must care for Charlie very deeply.

431
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,640
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah. Fine.

432
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,320
He's a nice boy. When he's not
distracting you from your coursework.

433
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,480
And maybe we could
have him and Sarah 'round in a few weeks?

434
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,920
 Your brother's a prick.

435
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,360
-Yeah.
-Okay.

436
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,320
 Thanks for coming.
Thank you for coming. I'm sorry.

437
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,440
- Thank you, Sarah.
- Bye-bye.

438
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,120
 Just gonna say goodbye.

439
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,560
So, prom tomorrow?

440
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,160
Yeah. We're still going together?

441
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,520
Yeah.

442
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,000
Like, together together?

443
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,160
Yeah. Don't you want to?

444
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,800
-Bye.
-Bye.

445
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,160
