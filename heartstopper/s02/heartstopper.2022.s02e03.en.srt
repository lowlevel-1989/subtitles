1
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,080
 A restaurant.
That's a classic date location.

2
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,680
 Isn't that a bit boring though?

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,440
-So… a theme park!
-But you hate rollercoasters.

4
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,880
Ooh, what if you go to a bookshop
and, like, choose a book for each other

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,360
and have a cute little reading date?

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,840
Isaac, that's your dream date. Not Elle's.

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,240
Charlie, what do you and Nick do
for dates?

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,800
I mean, we went to the beach.

9
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,480
-Ugh. Basic.
-

10
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,480
What else?

11
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,920
I've been grounded, and he's got exams.
I've barely seen him outside of school.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I've been stuck at home
doing my history coursework.

13
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,280
Oh my God, you're all useless.

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,600
-Tao, you're really overthinking this.
-I'm not!

15
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,200
If this date doesn't work out, then I lose
my best friend in the whole world.

16
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,760
What about if we went to IKEA,
like in 500 Days of Summer? Hmm?

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,320
Tao.

18
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,920
-
- Hey, Sai!

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,080
 Sai, Otis, Christian, Nick,
collect the cones.

20
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,160
Charlie, can you collect
the rugby balls, please?

21
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,120
Good season, thank you!
Well done, you guys.

22
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,040
 Hey.

23
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,480
Did you hear we're having
a end-of-GCSE party

24
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,120
in the woods next week?

25
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,320
Yeah, it's gonna be wild,
and you guys should come.

26
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,520
Yeah, cool. Maybe.

27
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,560
Nick, man, we're not friends
with Harry and them lot anymore.

28
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,720
 Yeah, we're sorry
about what happened at the cinema.

29
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,960
We should have spoken up.

30
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,560
Thanks.

31
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,720
I do know you're not like Harry.

32
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,520
Guess it took me a while
to realize what a dick he is as well.

33
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,640
I seriously don't blame you
for fighting him.

34
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,880
I know you and Charlie
are really good mates.

35
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,560
Um…

36
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,200
Yeah.

37
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,960
Yeah.

38
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,200
What did you say that for?

39
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:13,400
-Still couldn't come out to any of them.
-Nick, it's fine. There's no deadline.

40
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,400
I know, but it's just annoying
when people think we're, like…

41
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,400
Best bros.

42
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm gonna tell
some of the rugby guys at least.

43
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,080
After exams.

44
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,720
If I don't come out at school soon,
we're probably gonna get found out anyway.

45
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,480
Because you keep wanting
to kiss at school.

46
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,200
Uh, I think you're also to blame for that.

47
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,000
Don't know what you mean.
I have never initiated a kiss at school.

48
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,960
 Oh, really?

49
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,840
-So what about the changing room?
-That didn't count.

50
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,120
-Or the English room?
-You kissed me first!

51
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,320
Or what about the…

52
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,720
Fine. You win.

53
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,760
Boys, I need…

54
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,680
 Come in.

55
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,520
-You wanted to see me, Miss?
-Come and sit down, Nick.

56
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,440
I appointed you captain last year

57
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,600
because you were the only one
who could make these boys into a team.

58
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,600
But this term,

59
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,600
I've sensed some distance has grown
between you and most of the lads.

60
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,680
I don't wanna make assumptions,

61
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,800
but I assume
this has something to do with it.

62
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,200
I guess so.

63
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,080
If any of the lads
say anything out of line,

64
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,840
you tell me immediately, all right?

65
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,360
Yeah.

66
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,320
Yeah, I will.

67
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,840
When I was at uni, things were pretty bad.

68
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,600
And that was in women's rugby.

69
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,800
Lots of lesbians in women's rugby.
That's how I met my wife.

70
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,520
I remember what it was like,
telling all my friends.

71
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,800
Some took it better than others.

72
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,040
None of the guys know about me, so, um…

73
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,760
Well, you don't owe them
that information, okay?

74
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,800
Thank you, Miss.

75
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,120
And, uh… maybe keep the kissing
outside of team practice?

76
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,800
Charlie, still waiting
on your coursework essay.

77
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,760
It's nearly done.

78
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,920
You have until the end of the day.

79
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,520
I don't wanna do this anymore.

80
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,640
-It's your last exam. You're nearly done.
-No!

81
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,280
Then it's basically the Paris trip,

82
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,920
and we get to spend every day together
for the whole thing.

83
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,760
Okay, that does sound pretty good.

84
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,280
See? Let's go over ionic compounds.

85
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,520
You've spent so much time helping me.

86
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,480
What about your history coursework?
I haven't helped you with that at all.

87
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,600
It's fine. It's done.

88
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,080
You are amazing.

89
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,440
Sh!

90
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,800
 Ionic compounds.

91
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,600
James, isn't it your last exam
today as well?

92
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,240
Yep. I should probably be doing
some last-minute revision right now,

93
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,640
but this is more fun.

94
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,160
Oh, have you read this one?

95
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,440
-Of course I've read that one.
-It's not that good.

Oi-oi!

125
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,720
End-of-GCSEs party
in the woods near my house tonight! Yeah!

126
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,080
And make sure you bring your GCSE notes
so you can burn them!

127
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,840
Party tonight!
Everyone bring your own drinks, yeah?

128
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,280
-I'm free! I'm not grounded anymore!
- Yo!

129
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,440
Unless you're staying
for the meeting about the Paris trip,

130
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,600
can you all go home now?

131
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,680
Please. Please leave.

132
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,560
-How was your exam?
- It was good.

133
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,440
-Um…
-

134
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,240
Paris is basically
like a five-day-long sleepover.

135
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,240
You're gonna be
so annoyed with me after that.

136
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,840
Aww.

137
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,480
But I love you
because of how annoying you are.

138
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,520
I mean… Uh…

139
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,160
I didn't mean that in an "I love you" way.
That… That was just a casual "I love you."

140
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,560
That's not me asking you
to say it back or anything.

141
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,960
Yeah.

142
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,240
Yeah.

143
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,120
 Hey! Sahar!

144
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,000
I think prom should be vampire themed,
and here's why!

145
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,920
 No, that is the worst idea.

146
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,360
 Hey, Isaac.

147
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,240
-What you reading?
-It's called Book Lovers.

148
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,640
 And this is Sahar.

149
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,040
-Hi.
-Hi, nice to meet you.

150
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,280
-Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

151
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,720
Youssef. On time as always.

152
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,800
Nathan.

153
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,080
Are you also having regrets
about signing up for this?

154
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,040
Oh. It'll be a laugh, won't it?

155
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,400
Where's Tao?

156
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,800
 Hey, Isaac.

157
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,960
- Oh, hi, James.
-Um…

158
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,480
I… I… I was just thinking,

159
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,000
did you wanna come
to that end-of-exams party tonight?

160
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,560
Oh, um…

161
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,200
-Yeah.
-Okay. 

162
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,760
-Cool.
-Cool.

163
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,480
And all your friends
should come, too, obviously.

164
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,960
- Sweet.
- Thank you.

165
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,040
-See you there. Bye, Isaac.
-Bye.

166
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,440
- Oh my God, Isaac. What was that?
- He's nice.

167
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,840
I could come out at the party
to some of the rugby guys,

168
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,120
so if it goes badly, we could just leave.

169
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,440
Okay, everyone.  Can we all
quieten down a little bit, please?

170
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,080
-
-Everyone…

171
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,040
Quiet!

172
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,600
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Farouk.

173
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,960
Uh, welcome, everyone.

174
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,880
I hope you're all excited
about our Parisian adventure.

175
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,720
Yes!

176
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,520
So we'll now ask you
to get into groups of four,

177
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,080
who will be the people
you share hotel rooms with.

178
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:13,160
And we've been told to inform you
that boys and girls cannot share rooms.

179
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,480
 Oh dear! Oh no!

180
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,720
 Yeah, we know.

181
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,400
Heartbreaking, isn't it?

182
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,840
Groups of four, please.

183
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,400
All right, boys. Right. Yeah.

184
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,680
- Sahar!
- The four of us, okay. Yes.

185
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,360
-That was fairly painless.
-

186
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,800
Where is Tao?

187
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,560
 We're gonna be so old.

188
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,160
-Careful!
-That door gets me every time.

189
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,720
 What… the… hell?

190
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,320
Hi. Uh…

191
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,880
These are for you.

192
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,840
-For finishing your GCSEs.
-What's happening right now? 

193
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,880
Elle, I like you.

194
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,440
Romantically.

195
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,960
And I was wondering
if you wanted to go on a date.

196
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,480
Tonight.

197
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,440
You…

198
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,240
like me?

199
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,240
Um…

200
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,920
Yeah.

201
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,720
I guess I was sort of hoping…

202
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,720
I've been sort of wondering
if you liked me back?

203
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,840
Uh, duh!

204
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,880
-Sh!
-

205
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,320
 Darcy!

206
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,760
Well…

207
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,800
Yeah.

208
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,560
So, tonight?
I thought maybe we could go to the cinema.

209
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,320
Okay.

00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,840

doesn't it?

 Okay, well,

262
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,120
just ask me for a lift next time.

263
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,480
My mum can pick you up.
It's really not a problem.

264
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,600
Okay.

265
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,000
Yeah.

266
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,800
Text you later.

267
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,720
-I don't know why she didn't just ask.
-Maybe she was just embarrassed.

268
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:21,680
Darcy's the most confident person I know.
Literally nothing embarrasses her.

269
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,440
 No, no, no.
This is my duty as boyfriend.

270
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,800
- Stop it!
- I'm taking adorable pictures.

271
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,720
 Well, no.

272
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,400
- Okay, I will tickle you.
-Stop it! Please! Stop! Stop! Stop!

273
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,880
-Okay, you win. You win.
- I have to.

274
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,840
Are you sure you wanna come out
to the rugby boys tonight?

275
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,760
-If you're not feeling well--
-I'm fine.

276
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,760
I can do this.

277
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,320
Just think about us
being out as a couple in Paris.

278
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,680
Holding hands in the Louvre.

279
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,720
-
-Kissing in front of the Mona Lisa.

280
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,160
Yeah.

281
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,560
Come on.

282
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,880
 Let's go find them.

283
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,400

290
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,480
I, um… I need to talk to you guys.

291
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,000

292
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,880

00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,960

298
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,320
Fire! Fire! Fire!

299
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,240
I just think

300
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,840
that's probably Wes Anderson's
least technically good movie,

301
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,720
from, like, a story perspective.

302
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,760
I mean, it all hinges
on the romance between the two kids,

303
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,280
which is so unbelievable anyway

304
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,760
because they meet
and fall in love immediately.

305
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,560
And, like, they're kids,

306
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,040
so obviously
it's not going to last long term.

307
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,200
You really shouldn't
have picked that movie.

308
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,080
It's not my fave, but you love it, so…

309
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,080
But if we're going on a date,
we should do something we both enjoy.

310
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,160
My mum should be here
in, like, five minutes.

311
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,520
Still wanna go to this party?

312
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,880
Yeah. Sure.

313
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,680
Thanks for asking me out on a date.

314
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,480
Um… Thanks for saying yes.

315
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,160
 Burn it! Burn it!
Burn it! Burn it! Burn…

316
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,080
I didn't know you invited them.

317
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,440
Yeah. They're my friends.

318
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,240
What?

319
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,920
I don't understand
what I did wrong tonight!

320
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,640
It's like you were trying to be
a completely different person.

321
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,800
You're the one who's completely different!

322
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,800
You've gone off with your new friends
and have forgotten I exist completely.

323
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,440
You're the one who said
we'd always put our friendship first.

324
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,040
You promised.

325
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,920
Well, I guess
romance does ruin friendship.

326
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,400
 Tao.

327
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,200
How'd it go?

328
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,000
-Bad.
-Maybe he was just nervous.

329
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,600
I'm fundamentally unlikable.

330
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,080
Don't say that, Tao.

331
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,000
-He was probably trying to impress you.
-I liked the old Tao.

332
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,320
I try too hard, and I talk too much.

333
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,840
-I ruin everything.
-Tao, please don't say that.

334
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,680
I've liked him for so long,
and it just hurts.

335
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,760
-I don't wanna feel like this anymore.
-Come here.

336
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,560
 I'm gonna go home.

337
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,000
 Charlie?

338
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,960
Charlie?

339
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,960
Charlie.

340
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:15,920
Hi.

341
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,760
Sorry, um…

342
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,080
Where's Charlie?

343
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,600
I, um… I lost him. Sorry.

344
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,960
You said you'd look after him.

345
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,840
Not very good
at keeping your promises, are you?

346
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,800
You don't look well.

347
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,200
I'll find him.

348
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,360
I promise.

349
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,960
So I'm actually going
to Turkey this summer.

350
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,000
Turkey! Oh, how lovely.

-That's all I can say.

352
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,080
Yeah, it's really exciting.
My parents have a caravan…

353
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,440
- What's up, mate?
-Mate, you all right?

354
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,920
Yeah, I, uh, just, um…

355
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,120
I just needed to talk to you guys
about something.

356
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:31,880
You're bisexual?
So you're gonna cheat on my brother?

357
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,960
Are you sure you're not just gay?

358
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,360
Aww. Share with the group.

359
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,120
Come on. Spit it out.

360
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,760
It's fun, isn't it?
Sneaking around with him.

361
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,680
Pick a side.

362
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,560
-You promised you'd come out.
- I should've known you'd be gay.

363
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,960
- He's still lying for you.
- …why I didn't wanna tell you.

364
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,160
Nick doesn't wanna talk to you, Harry.
Piss off.

365
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,680
 Oi, what's his problem? 

366
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,480
G, you know how funny it is?

367
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,680
Are you okay?

368
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,640
I feel really ill.

369
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,760
I'm taking you home.

370
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,520
-Oh, you're a star.
-Is he okay?

371
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,000
Oh, he'll be fine.
Just a bit of sunstroke probably.

372
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,640
I did tell him to put a hat on
when he took Nellie out today.

373
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,280
D'you mind if I stay for a bit?
Just to make sure he's okay.

374
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,520
Of course, darling.

375
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,600
Not past your curfew. I don't want
to get you in trouble with your parents.

376
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,320
Nick's so lucky to have you, Charlie.

377
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,960
 Mm.

378
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:07,880
 Hey.

379
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,480
Hey.

380
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,400
I made you tea.

381
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,040
Char.

382
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:22,960
Yeah?

383
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,240
-You told Harry to piss off.
-

384
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,880
I enjoyed that.

385
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,920
-So did I.
-

386
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,400
I'd do it again.

387
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,880
Yeah?

388
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,560
-I'd fight them.
-

389
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,960
You'd fight?

390
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,280
I'd fight anyone who's mean to you.

391
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,280
 I'm sorry.

392
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,520
What for?

393
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,040
I said I'd tell them, but I couldn't.

394
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,240
Nick.

395
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,280
You have nothing to apologize for.

396
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,280
Tonight just wasn't the night.

397
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,160
I promised.

398
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,240
What do you mean?

399
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,840
When we went to the beach.

400
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,720
I told you I was gonna come out, but…

401
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,520
I've just been finding it so hard.

402
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,320
You didn't promise anything.

403
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,600
I think there's this idea
that when you're not straight,

404
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,680
you have to tell
all your friends and family immediately.

405
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,640
Like you owe it to them.

406
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,880
But you don't.

407
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,560
Maybe we should forget
the coming-out plan for a while.

408
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,280
Really?

409
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,280
Yeah.

410
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,800
Let's just stay low-key in Paris,

411
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,440
and then it'll be the summer holidays,
and we can just be us.

412
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,600
That does sound nice.

413
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,680
Yeah.

414
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,480
You sure you're okay with it?

415
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,320
Yeah.

416
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,680
Just…

417
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:33,320
Obviously I want you to come out
when and how you want to.

418
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,640
And if that takes a long time,
that's completely okay.

419
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,640
But…

420
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,800
I guess

421
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:53,160
part of me just wants everyone
to know you're my boyfriend.
