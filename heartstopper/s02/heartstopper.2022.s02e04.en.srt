Yeah. We probably shouldn't
sit next to each other on the coach.

7
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,920

 Elle, I saved you a space.

 It's the most Instagrammable city

have, like, a seven-step skincare routine,

Yeah.

40

Before you and Nick got together,

41
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,160
how did you know
that you liked him in that way?

42
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,040
Uh…

43
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,880
I just always wanted to be around him.

44
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,600
But also, anytime he was there,
I felt like I couldn't breathe.

45
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,280
And I literally could not stop
thinking about kissing him.

46
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,160
Yes. Hundred percent.
We'll have to get some.

47
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,360
 Yes, please.

48
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,640
 Oh… Hey!

49
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,360
-So we… So the bus goes…
-On the train.

50
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,520
-On the train?
-Yeah.

51
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,560
 Yeah, we're arriving today.

52
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,160
I'm about to lose signal.
We're in the Eurotunnel.

53
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,640
That'd be great.
Can you text me when you're free?

54
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,280
 Okay. Bye.

55
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,280
What the hell was that?

56
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,000
My dad.

57
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,120
Your dad's French?

58
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,120
Yeah. He lives in Paris, so, um…

59
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,200
Yeah. We're gonna try and meet up.
I don't really see him that often, so…

60
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,120
Oh.

61
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,320
-
- What?

62
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,160

63
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,680
Sir?

64
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,400
-Are we under the water?
-Yeah.

65
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,480
Then why can't we see any fish?

66
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,960
- What? Darcy!
-It's just pitch black.

67
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,480
 Did you see how angry he was?

68
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,240
- It's not gonna be made of glass.
-I wanted an obvious answer!

69
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,240
-Surely there's a reasonable explanation.
-No.

70
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,920
 Okay, we're about
half an hour away now, everyone.

71
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,960
We get to hang out in Paris.

72
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,680
Sleeping in the same bed.

73
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,720
Kissing as much as we want.

74
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,560
It's literally gonna be
the best few days of our lives.

75
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,520
I guess I've just been worried
about when I said

76
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,720
you know?

77
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,360
You didn't say it back?

78
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,040
You mean about our prom outfits,
'cause, you know,

79
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,600
I still think
we should be Princess Peach and Mario,

80
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,960
and my reasoning for this is…

81
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,560
 Here we are, lads!

82
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,360
 Such perfect timing…

83
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,120
 Oh my God!

84
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,320
 Wow!

85
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,760
Mr. Farouk and I will be in room 203
if you need us.

86
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,080
But hopefully you won't.

87
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,120
- Let's go!
- Let's go! Ah!

88
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,920
Darcy, wait!

89
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,400
Elle. Do you need a hand?

90
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,960
No.

91
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,800
Is that my deal? Slow and steady.

92
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,360
 Oh, nice.

93
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,280
We have to share beds?

94
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,960
-Well, I'm having the window bed.
-I want the other bed.

95
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,360
 I hate being woken up by the sun.

96
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,040
I guess I'll share with Tao,
and you can share with Isaac.

97
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,400
Uh…

98
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,200
Yeah.

99
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,440
I thought you'd find it awkward
sharing with Nick.

100
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,440
Just standing next to Elle
makes me feel like I'm being electrocuted.

101
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,400
- Bounce test!

102
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,320

103
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,520
Hey. We're in Paris.

104
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,160
No being sad. Come on.

Wow.

111
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,520
-Ooh, uh, sorry.
-It's fine.

112
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,000
Oh, uh… Thanks.

113
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,600
Hot chocolat.

114
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,640

-Yeah. Thanks.

-Go on, do it again.
-Have you seen…

117
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,080
I wanted to share a bed with you.

118
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,160
Same.

119
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,680
I'm sure we'll get to do it one day.

120
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,760
Uh… I didn't mean…

121
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,840
I… I didn't mean do it.
I… I was just talking about, you know,

122
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,120
sharing a bed, that's all.

123
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,280
So, um…

124
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,320
 That came out all wrong.

125
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,280
I know what you meant.

126
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,520
Okay.

127
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:54,960
I can't wait.

128
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,800
Yeah.

129
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,640

134
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,600
Will we ever get to kiss
without people walking in on us?

135
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,760
Well, at least
I've not lost this challenge yet.

136
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,720
-Oh. Oh, you're gonna lose.
-Really?

137
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,880
-Just you wait.
-Really? 

138
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,440
 We're going
to see the Eiffel Tower! Come on.

139
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,320
Look, look, look! We can go over there.

140
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,120
 Gather 'round, please.

141
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,520
Okay, gang, today,
you get to explore Montmartre.

142
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,120
There are lots of shops
and places to visit,

143
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,640
like the Sacré Coeur church,
the Musée de Montmartre.

144
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,440
 That's "museum"

145
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,360
for everyone on this trip
who doesn't even take French.

146
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,120
- Stay in groups.
-Excuse me.

147
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,560
- No less than two people.
-Hi.

148
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,920
Hi.

149
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,120
Meet back here by the coach
at 5:00 p.m., please.

150
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,040
And please don't get lost.

151
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,440
-I'm looking at you.
-Do you wanna come with us today?

152
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,680
-I'd love that.
- Let's go!

153
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,680
 So I think
we should start over here.

154
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,440
We should get one of those padlocks
and write our initials on it.

155
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,520
You joking?

156
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,240
That's so lame.

157
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,640
I need a drink.

158
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,840
An alcoholic drink.

159
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,320
We probably shouldn't drink alcohol.

160
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,000
I need a croissant then.

161
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,440
Come on.

162
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,560
 I've been craving ice cream
all day. I need some ice cream.

163
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,560
This place is so beautiful.

164
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,920
What's the plan?

165
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,760
-The Musée de Montmartre.
-The museum?

166
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,160
I don't know.
I think museums are kinda boring.

167
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,360
Yeah, it'd be nice to just explore.

168
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,240
But Renoir painted there.

169
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,640
Yeah, it's a really important place
in art history.

170
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,600
Why don't you two go together then?

171
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,480
We can meet you in a couple of hours?

172
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,800
Just us?

173
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,400
Sure.

174
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,200
Cool. We'll see you in a couple of hours.

175
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,760
- Have fun.
-Bye.

176
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,160
-Take pics.
-Have a good time.

177
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,800
-See you soon.
-Bye!

178
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,640
 You know exactly
what you're doing.

179
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,200
Mischief-maker.

180
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,640
I've influenced you.

181
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,360
 Look what I have bought!

182
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,960
I'm here.

183
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,040
-Uh, that's wrong!
-

184
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,280
 Thanks for inviting me
to hang out with you guys.

185
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,840
My friends just wanted
to find the nearest McDonald's.

186
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,200
It's fine. Um…

187
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,280
It's nice that we get a chance
to hang out outside the library for once.

188
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,840
Yeah. It's nice
just to be around other gay people.

189
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,200
 You have
such a cool friendship group.

190
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,160
 Yeah.

191
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,240
 Yes, monsieur?

192
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,200
Can I have two scoops
of chocolate, please?

193
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,280
Yes, of course. Are you English?

194
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,120
Yes! I'm on a school trip.

195
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,400
 No way! Your accent is very good.

196
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,560
Ah, thank you!

197
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,800
 Um…
Since when could you speak French

198
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,240
like an actual French person?

199
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,120
Oh, my dad's French.

200
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,320
Since when?

201
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,160
Since… his birth?

202
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,720
 Why do I not know this?

203
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,080
 How are things
between you and Nick?

204
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,320
Really good.

205
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,280
Why? Does it look like we're not okay?

206
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,920
It looks like Nick is so in love with you.

207
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,120
It's a bit unbearable to watch sometimes.

208
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,760
I suppose I'm sort of… jealous

209
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,120
of you and Darcy.

210
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,360
You're out, and you can hold hands
and kiss and…

211
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,280
I really want that.

212
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,600
But I don't want Nick
to get bullied like I was.

213
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,520
It takes time.

214
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,560
It took ages for me to even feel
comfortable calling myself a lesbian,

215
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,120
and… and we were so scared
of what people might say at school,

216
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,800
so we didn't tell anyone
about us for months.

217
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,040
But eventually, we stopped caring
about all those people.

218
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,440
We just realized…

219
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,160
 Take your seats.
The performance will begin in ten minutes.

220
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,320
You're gonna be great,
and even if you're not great,

221
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,920
I'll still think you're great
'cause I always think you're great.

222
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,280
And I'll clap really loud

223
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,520
even if you fall over
and mess up the entire thing.

224
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,640
 …me and her were all that mattered.

225
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,920
You and Nick will get to that point.

226
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,720
I know you will.

227
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,360
I'm jealous of you and Nick
in some ways too.

228
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,400
What? Why?

229
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,200
You both talk about your feelings.

230
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:22,200
But Darcy just makes everything
into a joke.

231
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,240
It's hard to get her to open up.

232
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,920
I said "I love you" to her last week,

233
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,640
and… she didn't say it back.

234
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,320
I feel like maybe she didn't even want to.

235
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,560
I'm sure she does want to.

236
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:45,120
And Paris is the perfect place
to have that conversation.

237
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,760
Absolute disaster!

238
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,880
Jonesy, they were out of mint choc chip,
so I had to get us strawberry.

239
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,280
 Shall we go and sit down there?
It's a better view.

240
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,960
- Stop it! Shall we go over there?
-

241
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,280
Oh, uh… 

242
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,720
I'm still full from breakfast.

243
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,680
Charlie, you didn't eat
that much breakfast.

244
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,800
Yeah, I did.

245
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,000
Chocolate? Not bubblegum?

246
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,200
Well, you're a good influence on me.

247
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,160
It's not bad.

248
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,680
-You've got some on your nose.
-Oh.

249
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,840
 Let me get that.

250
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,080
A little bit more.

251
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,440
There we go.

252
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,240
MUSEUM OF MONTMARTRE

253
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,880
- Here we are.
- Here we are.

254
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,640
-Tao, I--
-We don't have to talk about it.

255
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,880
We should talk about it.

256
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,120
I agree with what you said.

257
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,920
Things were better
when we were just friends.

258
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,840
Right.

259
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,640
Yeah.

260
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,960
And I'm sorry for being weird
about Naomi and Felix.

261
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,720
I'm happy you're making new friends,

262
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,640
but I just get in my head
about being left behind and alone.

263
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,120
Our friendship is really important to me.

264
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,280
Me too.

265
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,160
I don't wanna stop being friends.

266
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,760
Okay.

267
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,040
Okay.

268
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,120
Shall we, uh… go look at some art now?

269
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,760

-Yeah.

-That's what the color reminds me of.
-Stop!

283
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,960
The color. It's reaching out at me.

284
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,240
-It makes me jump.
-We're in a public space.

285
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,880
-Yeah. Sh!
-We can do this at your house, but not--

286
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,760

 That'll be you in three years' time.

293
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,880
 It will!

294
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,040
I'm manifesting.

295
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,560
Uh!

296
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,240
 I don't understand
what face she was making. It was like…

297
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,120
Like, with the mouth. I don't know.

298
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,640
-Oh, oui. Okay.
-Okay.

299
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,200
-Yeah.
-Oui, of course, of course.

300
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,160
- Non speak French.
- Okay.

301
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,760
 Okay, so… uh…

302
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,520

- Hungry.
- We're trying to find somewhere.

307
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,960
-Elle!
-How did it go?

308
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,960
Fine. We're totally back to normal.

309
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:58,920
It was fun.

310
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,840
-It was really fun.
- Mm-hmm?

311
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,840
 And?

312
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,800
And that's it.

313
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,880
We're just friends again.

314
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,080
-As if. As if. As if.
-That is it!

315
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,800
-There's more to it!
- No! No, no.

316
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,680
We could go to the Sacré Coeur?

317
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,400
Or we could do some shopping?

318
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,320
Or go to the museum?

319
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,160
- All right, whatever, man.
-

320
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,480
-Get off!
- What?

321
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,640
Hey, guys!

322
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,760
Um… do you guys mind
if I hang with you for a bit?

323
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,600
-Ben's being so boring.
- Of course not.

324
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,120
-Sure.
-Feel free.

325
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,880
- Been to the Sacré Coeur yet?
-No, I haven't.

326
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,920
 Let's go together then. Come on.

327
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Yay! Thanks, guys.
You guys are more fun. 

328
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,840
It's like he doesn't even wanna hang out
with me anymore now that we're dating.

329
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,160
All he cares about is having a girlfriend.

330
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,520
And now he just ignores me all the time.

331
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,360
-I'm not even sure he likes me that much.
-Do you even like him?

332
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,400
He sounds horrible.

333
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,760
What about you?

334
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,760
Do you have anything going on with anyone?

335
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,840
-I thought maybe you and Tao--
-No! Not gonna happen.

336
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,000
We're fine just being friends.

337
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,600
Okay.

338
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,040
Maybe I haven't had
the best track record of relationships,

339
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:34,440
but I think being honest
is better than living with regret.

340
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,280
-
- Tao, what are you doing?

341
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,720
 What are you on about?

342
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,720
-Tao!
-Why are you walking like that?

343
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,560
What's wrong with you? Oh my God!

344
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,000
There's not even any music!

345
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,680
Tao-wuh!

346
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,160
- Stop!
- Who does he think he is?

347
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,080
- Sorry, it wasn't me!
-We're calm.

348
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,080
Listen… 

349
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,760
 Charlie, sit down. Sit down.

350
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,920
 Good, good, good, good, good.
Everyone's here.

351
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,680
 Also…

352
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:41,320
 I'm serious, big man.
I get bloated. It's not funny. Cheers.

353
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,920
-
- Here, please. Yeah, thanks.

354
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,080
 Bon appétit.

355
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,040
- Uh, escargots?
- Oh… M… Merci.

356
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,120
- Oh!
-No!

357
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,360
 Here you go.
We're in France. It had to be done.

358
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,200
 Mm. I feel sorry for you
and your terrible decisions.

359
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,520
No, don't. Don't do it. Don't do it.

360
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,760
- No!
- Yes, Tao!

361
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,400
- Tao!
-Are you okay?

362
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,880
- That is disgusting!
- Can you breathe?

363
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,240
- Boeuf bourguignon?
- That's mine.

364
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,520
-Thank you.
-You can have that one.

365
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,880
 Bon appétit.

366
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,520
I haven't spoken to you properly in ages.

367
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,000
How was your first day in Paris?

368
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,360
 Not interested
in how my day was then?

369
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,920
Why are you in a mood with me?

370
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,640
Because you're supposed
to be my boyfriend!

371
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,760
But instead, you've got
some sort of obsession with Charlie.

372
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,040
-
-What are you trying to say?

373
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,880
I don't know
why you're obsessed with Charlie!

374
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,400
And, to be honest, I don't even care.

375
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:17,080
All I know is you're a terrible boyfriend,
and I deserve better.

376
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,760
I'm breaking up with you.

377
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,160
Your energy's off!

378
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,360
You're not mature,
and clearly you have some issues

379
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,040
that you need to resolve
before you're ready for a relationship.

380
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,960
And I'm not gonna wait around for you!
I think it's time I focused on myself.

381
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,840
If you don't want to be with me anymore,
that's fine,

382
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,440
but you don't have to be
such a bitch about it.

383
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,280
Benjamin, language.

384
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,760
- She's got a point.
-Pipe down.

385
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,480
There's no need to call her a bitch. What?

386
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,040
Fine then.

387
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,360
-
- Wow!

388
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,840
Bye, Ben.

389
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,160
-She's done nothing wrong.
-He gives me such, like, stink energy.

390
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,440
-Like, stinky energy.
-Stinky, like a smell.

391
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,280
Oh, hey.

392
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,800
Hey.

393
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,480
Just wanted to come and check
that you were okay.

394
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,000
I think I am.

395
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,440
I don't know, maybe I shouldn't have
done that in front of everyone.

396
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,040
Well, I think it was one
of the coolest things I've ever seen, so…

397
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,720
-
-Agreed.

398
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,400
Did you and Ben ever…

399
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,720
It doesn't matter.

400
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,680
He's gone now.

401
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,760
Ugh, everything would be so much easier
if I was into girls.

402
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,760
Uh…

403
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:02,080
I'm not so sure about that,
but, um… I know what you mean.

404
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,400
Could I maybe have a hug?

405
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,240
How'd it go with Elle today?

406
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,560
It was fine.

407
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,440
We just walked around the museum
for a bit.

408
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,120
It was nice.

409
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,640
I always thought
you two would be good together, so…

410
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,160
You don't get it.

411
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,000
Elle is literally
the most amazing person in the world.

412
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,920
She's gone through so much shit.

413
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,920
Like, I was her friend
when she came out as trans,

414
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,520
and that was not a fun time for her.

415
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,040
Why would she ever like me anyway?

416
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:17,000
She's so cool and interesting
and beautiful, and I'm…

417
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,440
I'm just me, you know.

418
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,480
Well, I… I think you're pretty cool too.

419
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,800
-And interesting.
-But not beautiful?

420
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:32,080
Well… you're a good-looking guy,
if that's what you're worried about.

421
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,120
I thought you didn't even like me.

422
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,520
I do like you, Tao.

423
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,840
You know, you're… you're funny,

424
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,200
you're into weird indie films that,
you know, I probably wouldn't understand.

425
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,520
You know, you're…
You care about your friends so…

426
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,280
loudly.

427
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:59,160
Without worrying
what anyone else might think, and that's…

428
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,840
Well, that's… that's really cool.

429
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,120
Uh…

430
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,400
I'm gonna go get something
from the vending machine.

431
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,720
Isaac, you coming?

432
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,240
Yeah, sure.

433
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,200
HELLO X

434
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,920
Did you just post
another photo of me on Instagram?

435
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,640
I might have.

436
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,080
What?

437
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,080
 Oh, okay!

438
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,320
Hi.

439
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,000
-Hi.
-

440
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,800
-Oh my God, Nick, you giant rugby idiot!
-Now you are fully trapped!

441
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,600
Now you have to sleep in my bed.

442
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,440
It's probably a bad idea.

443
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,000
You seemed kind of down today.

444
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,240
I just wanted to be alone with you.

445
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,720
You taste like toothpaste.

446
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,240
Like the first time we kissed
at your house.

447
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,720
Well, I literally
just have brushed my teeth, so…

448
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,720
So, um…

449
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,760
Is that okay?

450
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,640
Yeah.

451
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:59,040
Nick, we… we should stop.
We're gonna get caught.

452
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,080
I… Yeah. Yeah.

453
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,880
I think you lost the challenge.

454
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,480
Ugh!
