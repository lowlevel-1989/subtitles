1
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,160
Nicolas!

2
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,600
Would you feel better if I waited here?

3
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,120
No.

4
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,240
No. Please come with me.

5
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,160
 You've grown so much!
What happened? Playing a lot of rugby?

6
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,760
Yeah, a bit.

7
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,040
 This is my dad, Stéphane.

8
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,400
This is my…

9
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,680
-I'm Charlie.
- Nice to meet you, Charlie.

10
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,760
Coffee? Coffee?

11
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,320
 So you meet Nick in school?

12
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,080
Yeah.

13
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,680
 Ah, great.

14
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,480
So good to see you in Paris!

15
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,360
You never visit.

16
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:36,880
Oh, uh…

17
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,320
When he was younger,
he would visit every summer. 

18
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,720
When do you graduate? Must be soon now.

19
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,080
Uh, I've still got two more years left.

20
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,600
Ah. 

21
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,400
I would have invited you this summer,

22
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,800
but Martine is having
this new kitchen fitted.

23
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,960
The apartment is a mess. 

24
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,800
That's okay. Um…

25
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,520
You know, I'd still like
to meet her sometime, if you wanted me to.

26
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,680
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

27
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,920
Perhaps someday soon, mm?

28
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:16,200
Now, tell me about this school trip.
Have you been seeing the sights of Paris?

29
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,160
Yeah, most of them. Uh, we went
to the Eiffel Tower, uh… Sacré Coeur.

30
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,880
-The Louvre this morning.
-Yeah.

31
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,720
-It's been really fun.
-

32
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,160
Excuse me for a moment.

33
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,000
You doing okay?

34
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,720
I think so.

35
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,200
 I'm sorry, boys.

36
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,160
Something has come up,
and I just can't get out of it.

37
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,400
Oh, uh…

38
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,600
 But I haven't told you my news.

39
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,600
I'm coming to England next week.

40
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,040
-Small business trip.
-Oh, um…

41
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,440
You should come to dinner.

42
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,600
I'm sure Mum would be okay with it,
and David will want to see you.

43
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,640
I miss that boy.

44
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,760
Ha! We'll see. I'll talk to your mother.

45
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,480
 Keep up with the rugby.

46
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,960
Girls love rugby players.

47
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,920
David always had lots of girlfriends
when he was your age.

48
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,200
 Was good
to meet you, Charlie.

49
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,480
Wonderful to meet one of Nick's friends.

50
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,280
Yeah. You too.

51
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,640
 I'll call you later.

52
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,720
Huh?

53
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,640
Wow.

54
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,080
That was fast.

55
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,040
I really thought
I could talk to him about you.

56
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,360
It's okay.

57
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,720
There'll be other chances.

58
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,120
He just doesn't…

59
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,920
He doesn't know me.

60
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,440
I mean, he knows I like rugby, and…

61
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,000
that's it.

62
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,320
Let's walk back to the coach.

63
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,520
You can rant about him
the whole way there.

64
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,000
Okay.

65
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,840
-Have you still not found him?
-Oh!

66
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,280
-Uh… No.
-No.

67
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,360
I have something to share.

68
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,200
Me and Elle kissed.

69
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,440
-
-No way.

70
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,680
-No, you didn't!
-Yes!

71
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,760
No, you didn't!

72
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,040
We kissed.

73
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,120
 I'm so proud of you!

74
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,560
 Oh my God, Tao,
you have to tell us everything.

75
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,440
Well, she kind of initiated it.

76
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,480
I… I… I literally just went for it,
and I thought it was a mistake.

77
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,040
-But it wasn't a mistake!
-And then we kissed again.

78
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,400
-Ah, but I kissed her that time.
-Oh my God! No you didn't!

79
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:02,120
-Then the third kiss was, like, amazing.
-Three times?!

80
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,040
This is the best thing
that's ever happened!

81
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,360
Wait, so what does this mean?
Are you two dating?

82
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,480
I don't know. We literally had
our first kiss like five hours ago.

83
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,480
-You need to talk. I'll text the girls.
-Wait.

84
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,960
-What are you sending?
-"Well, we should explore the hotel."

85
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,640
You have to ask him to be your boyfriend.
I'm sure he'll say yes.

86
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,480
-
-I don't know. It's… It's too… too soon.

87
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,560
- Do it!
-Guys, look!

88
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,720
-Ooh!
-Shall we go?

89
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,640
Let's go!

90
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,280
 We definitely shouldn't be
sneaking around this late.

91
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,440
 Well, it's my birthday tomorrow,
so what I say goes!

92
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,120
-
- Sh!

93
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,160
Come on! Come on, we're going. Let's go!

94
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,240
Sh! Sh!

95
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,040
 Let's go!

96
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,480
 Sh! Sh!

97
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,320
So, like, are we…

98
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,000
-What were you gonna say?
-Uh… I… I…

99
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,080
I… I forgot.

100
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,240
Finally.

101
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,680
If you even think
about giving me another hickey…

102
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,920
-I wasn't thinking about that!
-You so were.

103
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,640
How are you feeling?

104
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,240
Fine.

105
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,600
Charlie, you literally fainted
on me today.

106
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,000
But how are you feeling
about seeing your dad?

107
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,520
You wanted to come out to him.

108
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,640
I know I've been stressed
about coming out,

109
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,040
but… I don't think I realized
how stressed out you've been about it.

110
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,840
I get stressed about everything.

111
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,120
-You're not special.
-Charlie.

112
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,640
And it doesn't matter
how I feel about it anyway.

113
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,800
It's your coming out.

114
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,800
-You're the one who's going through it--
-Charlie.

115
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,360
It matters to me.

116
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,360
 Boys!

117
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,560
It's past 11. You should be in your room.

118
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,680
Go on now.

119
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,440
 Couldn't have let them off?

120
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,960
Pretty sure I did the exact same thing
at that age.

121
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,040
Sneaking around like that.

122
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,160
With a boy.

123
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,840
You never did anything like that?

124
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:38,840
Well, when you don't figure out you're gay
until your late 20s,

125
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,680
you tend to miss out on those

126
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,000
beautiful gay teenage experiences.

127
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,200
Hmm.

128
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:07,560
Probably a bit late for me to have
any youthful moments of discovery.

129
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:11,240
 Don't think there's
an age limit on those, to be honest.

130
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,000
You flirting with me?

131
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,240
Maybe.

132
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,400
Ah… Come on.

133
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,760

- All right.

178
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,120
If you wanted some privacy with Nick,
you could just say so.

179
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,480
You sure you're okay
with me borrowing this?

180
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,040
As long as you don't steal it
like the last three you borrowed.

181
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,280
-I actually quite like that one.
-I didn't steal them!

182
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,480
I just… forgot to give them back.

183
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,560
You forgot to give them back?

184
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,000
-Excuse me.
-

185
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,400
What are you doing?

186
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,840
I'm just

187
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,640
recharging.

188
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,280
We could

189
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,760
just stay here for a bit.

190
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,480
 Mm.

191
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,680
Yeah.

192
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,160
Why's that?

193
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,040
We haven't kissed in, like, two days.

194
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,760
Right.

195
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,080
Come on. We're gonna be late.

196
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,640
I hate you.

197
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,080
-No, you like me!
-Hmm…

198
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,840
I really don't.

199
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,640

200
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,680
- You did all of this?
- Yeah.

201
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,520
Everything has to be perfect for Tara.
She's a princess.

203
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,840

-No. No way.

334

That isn't even funny.
I barely know Charlie.

341
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,480
What? Can we just move on from this?

342
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,520
It's too personal.
Someone might get outed.

00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,280
- …bi, actually.
-But yeah.

352
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,920
-So…
-Do you want us to keep it a secret?

353
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,360
We're okay with people knowing.

354
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,160
I'm sorry to ruin this very lovely moment,
but I think I'm gonna be sick.

355
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,680
Mr. Farouk!

356
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,480
I'm going to pretend
I believe you have food poisoning.

357
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,000
Just try and take some deep breaths.
I'll get you a sick bag--

358
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,640
-
-Ooh.

359
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,480
Why did I get into teaching?

360
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,800
It's okay. It's okay.

361
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,680
-All right.
-What are you doing?

362
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,480
 No!

363
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,080
Nah, I'm not gonna drop you.

364
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,760
Ooh, whoa. Okay.

365
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,200
Whoa!

366
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,520
- Is that comfy? There we go.
-That's better. Ah!

367
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,720
 That's better. All right.

368
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,320
Now, can you remember
where we're meant to be going?

369
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,920
-We are going that way.
-That way?

370
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,400
-That way.
-I'm sure it was that way.

371
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,960
No, it's definitely that way.
It's that way.

372
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,480
-You came out to a room full of people.
-Yeah.

373
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,080
Yes, I did.

374
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,800
Do you think
it's gonna get passed around, like…

375
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,880
Do you think everyone in school's
gonna know about it?

376
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,120
Yeah. Probably.

377
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,160
I think I'm okay with that.

378
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,840
Nervous, but we'll be okay.

379
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,320
Yeah.

380
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:45,240
Since Tao and Isaac
are staying in the girls' room tonight,

381
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:48,320
I… could… sleep in here?

382
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,200
With you?

383
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,280
Well,

384
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,920
in that case,

385
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,800
I think you're gonna have to move over
'cause that's my side of the bed.

386
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,360
Well, I got here first, so…

387
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,480
-Did you now?
-Yeah.

388
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,960
Hmm. Okay.

389
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,760
-Nick! You're crushing me!
-What are you gonna do?

390
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,680
- It's my side!
- Tickle you! Absolutely, yes.

391
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,840
-Don't you dare!
-Tickle you!

392
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,920
We're gonna have to fight.
We're gonna have to fight.

393
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,040
Okay. We can fight.

394
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,320
-
- No way!

395
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,600
Ow!

396
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,640
Argh!

397
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,080
- This is unfair.
- Do I win?

398
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,680
 I guess so.

399
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,120
Payback.

400
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,240
Is this okay?

401
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,600
Uh…

402
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,600
Yeah.

403
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,440
That didn't sound very sure.

404
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,600
Uh… 

405
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,600
Sorry. Um…

406
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,800
I… I do like it. It's just, um…

407
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,960
I'm… I'm not sure I'm ready
to do anything more than kissing.

408
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,440
No, I…

409
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,000
I didn't think we'd do… that right now.

410
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,040
Oh.

411
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,920
I do… I do want to.

412
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,880
Yeah. Me too.

413
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,320
-Eventually.
-Yeah.

414
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,760
Same.

415
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,400
And I'd only wanna do it if you did,

416
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:53,800
and… if you didn't ever wanna do it,
then I wouldn't either.

417
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,880
-That sounded really cheesy.
-

418
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,920
Oh, I'm so embarrassing!

419
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,800
-I think we both are, to be honest.
-Why are we like this?

420
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,440
 I have no idea.

421
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,480
Kissing's still okay though?

422
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,840
 Wait, wait, wait.

423
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,560
 Oh, Tao.

424
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,160
- Don't! Don't tickle me.
-

425
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,200
Hello.

426
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,600
My name's Elle.

427
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,640
I can draw art.

428
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,400
Look at my amazing art.

429
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,360
Am I amazing?

430
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,120
Tao, sh!

431
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,600
-I'm sorry for ruining your birthday.
-Hey.

432
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,120
It's not ruined.

433
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,080
I wanted it to be perfect for you.

434
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,520
I have to be perfect for you.

435
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,480
Darcy, nobody's perfect.

436
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,320
I love you.

437
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,520
I love you so much.

438
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,960
I know it sounds like I don't mean it
because I'm drunk,

439
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,640
but I really do mean it.

440
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,080
I love you.

441
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,080
That's so gross. I was just sick.

442
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,240
