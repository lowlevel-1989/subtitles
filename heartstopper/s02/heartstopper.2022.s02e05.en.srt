23
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,240
I really enjoyed it.

That's fair.

42
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,120
It wasn't just his fault.
I was also involved.

43
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,840
Ugh! No need for the gory details.

44
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,360
Oi, Charlie Spring!
Who gave you that hickey? Oh my…

45
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,280
What?

46
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,680
 Well, that's not ideal.

47
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,760
Not hungry?

48
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,200
Not really.

49
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,960
Okay, well, um… I'll pack you a croissant,

50
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,680
so if you get hungry later,
you'll have a snack.

51
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,920
You're the best.

52
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,640
Something to be proud about, isn't it?
Getting some action. 

53
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,240
 Wait, is it true James McEwan
gave you that hickey?

54
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,160
What?

55
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,800
He's the only other gay guy
on the trip, so…

56
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,560
 Did you see that guy
in reception, dark hair?

57
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,600
-Maybe he gave Charlie his hickey.
- I saw someone in the gallery.

58
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,280
Leave him alone.
It's none of your business.

59
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,600
It… It… It wasn't me.

60
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,400
I mean, obviously, you know it wasn't me.

61
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,680
 Oh my God, look!

62
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,720
 I'm so excited to go
up the Eiffel Tower. It's gonna be so--

63
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,760
 Quiet!

64
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,960
Now, we've all been having fun in Paris,

65
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,760
but we thought this morning
would be a good time to remind you

66
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,880
why we're really here,

67
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,600
and that's to practice your French skills.

68
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,960
Now, we'll be putting you in pairs

69
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,400
and giving you
some Eiffel Tower vocabulary to translate

70
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,080
before you start
your climb to the top, okay?

71
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,280
Okay.

72
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,280
Starting with Charlie Spring

73
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,560
and James McEwan.

74
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,000
- Whey!
- Hush.

75
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,520
- Aw! It's a date!
- Stop it!

76
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,880
 Shut up, Harry.

77
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,120
 Next up is

78
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,720
Nick Nelson and Ben Hope.

79
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,440
Sir, I don't wanna go with Nick Nelson.

80
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,280
I don't give a rat's arse, rudeboy.
Grow up.

81
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,080
Okay, next we have Tara and Darcy.

82
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,600
- That's, "How much is it?"
- Oh, of course. Thank you.

83
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,680
 Do you think this is right?

84
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,720
I don't take French,
but I know that's wrong.

85
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,600
All right. I don't take French either.

86
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,720
C'est la vie.

87
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,000
I know you think it's funny
to point things out about people

88
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,560
and get a laugh out of your mates,
but do you ever stop and think

89
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,440
how you're actually making people feel?

90
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,760
Like, come on, Harry.
Where's your basic human empathy?

91
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,080
-Oh, come on, leave it out, book boy.
-So stupid everybody thinks it was me.

92
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,240
Like, just because we're both gay,
it means we must fancy each other.

93
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,200
-No offense.
-None taken.

94
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,000
Do you think Isaac thinks it was me?

95
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,920
I… I just don't want him
to think it was me.

96
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,360
He knows it wasn't you.

97
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,880
 Oh.

98
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,360
Okay.

99
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,400
-It wasn't him, was it?
- No!

100
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:30,320
 Darcy, I wanna talk about
what happened at the Paris trip meeting.

101
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,560
About Tao's proposal?

102
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,800
Yeah, I kinda feel like we should've known
it would've been a disaster after that.

103
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,560
But I still feel like if they just kiss,
they'll figure it out.

104
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,400
Darcy, you know that's not what I meant.

105
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,960
Remember when we were walking into Truham?

106
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,920
No. Not really.

107
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,800
You know what? Never mind.

108
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,440
Let's just get on with the worksheet.

109
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,240
-Are you happy?
-

110
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,760
What?

111
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,040
First Charlie, now Imogen.

112
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,320
You're the one who told her
about me and Charlie, aren't you?

113
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,840
It's your mission
to, like, mess up my life.

114
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,120
You never cared about either of them.

115
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,960
You used Imogen for popularity points,
and you didn't actually like Charlie.

116
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,960
You just liked having control over him.

117
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,120
What if I said I want Charlie back?

118
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,880
I get it. I was a dick back then,
but I was dealing with my own shit.

119
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,440
Charlie didn't even give me a chance
to figure myself out,

120
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,120
and then you came along,
and you stole him from me.

121
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,480
Charlie really liked me
before you got in his head.

122
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,280
At least I was nice enough not to give him
a hickey where everyone could see.

123
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,560
- Okay, is everyone finished?
-

124
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,320
 Now, it's very hot today,

125
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,360
so make sure you take it easy
on the stairs and stay hydrated.

126
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,880
Come on then.

127
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,200
We didn't get tickets for the lift?

128
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,120
No.

129
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,080
- Oh, come on, Charlie!
- Slow down!

130
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,880
- Too many stairs.
- We're going now. Come on.

131
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,160
-We have to get there before everyone.
-Can I have a break?

132
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,920
-Hi.
-Hi.

133
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,840
How are you?

134
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,960
- It's fine. I've got you.
-No! No!

135
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,440
I've got you. I've got you. Look at me.

136
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,560
- It's the last stretch.
- It's not.

137
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,160
-We've got so much further to go!
- Come on!

138
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,040
 We made it!

139
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,680
- Oh my God!
- Wow.

140
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,080
Wow.

141
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,600
 Oh my God.

142
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,720
Look! Go, go, go!

143
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,000
 Darcy!

144
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,600
 No, we will not
have this, thank you.

145
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,240
Come on. Stand up.

146
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,760
Come on.

147
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,160
Go enjoy the view. Thank you.

148
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,200
- Darcy!
-Great. That's great.

149
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,200
 Three, two, one, France!

150
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,240
-Okay, this is the most beautiful sight.
-We need to get a selfie for my mum.

151
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,240
 Okay.

152
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,680
Smile.

153
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,240
- She's gonna love that.
- She is.

154
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,160
Hey, Nick!

155
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,880
Is that hickey from you then?

156
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,480
What if it was?

157
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,520
Are you jealous?

158
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,600
- Ooh!
-

159
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,360
 I'm not gay.

160
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,120
Nah, leave 'em alone, lads. Come on.

161
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,680
Come on. You've got your own problems.

162
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,680
Did Harry just stick up for us?

163
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,440
 Hey! Come on! 

164
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,760
I think he did.

165
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,480
Weird.

166
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,160
Maybe we shouldn't
be hanging out right now.

167
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,920
More people might think
it was you who… you know.

168
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,840
You, um…

169
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,200
You do know

170
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,440
it was me, right?

171
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,040
-Yeah, I think I remember you being there.
-Yeah?

172
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,160
-Yeah.
-Good.

173
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,600
Let's go find the others.

174
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,920
 This is cute.

175
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,320
You could get one if you want.
They're selling them back there.

176
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,400
You really don't think
things are gonna work out?

177
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,800
Even if she does like me back,
and even if something did happen,

178
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,720
I'd still mess it up,
like I always do with everything.

179
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,000
You don't mess things up.
Name one thing you've messed up.

180
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,120
The cinema date?

181
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,200
My art coursework.

182
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,280
Your life, multiple times.

183
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,360
How?

184
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,400
Charlie,

185
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,840
I'm basically the reason
you got outed last year.

186
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,760
After you came out to us, I was talking
about you with Isaac, someone overheard,

187
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,640
and, next thing we know,
you're getting bullied every single day.

188
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,520
I never wanted to tell you
because I didn't want you to hate me.

189
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,960
But you know
that wasn't your fault, don't you?

190
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,160
Like, that was clearly an accident.

191
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,760
Tao, we've been friends
since the first day of Year 7.

192
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,720
Hey. I'm Tao.

193
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,560
-Charlie.
-Cool.

194
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,640
-Do you like Radiohead?
-Yeah.

195
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,400
Me too. Have you seen
the Romeo + Juliet movie from the '90s?

196
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,840
It's one of my favorite movies,

197
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,960
and it's got a Radiohead song
on the credits.

198
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,240
It makes me cry, like, every time.

199
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,160
 I was so shy
and scared of everyone,

200
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,000
but I immediately thought
how cool and funny and kind you were.

201
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,720
You were the only person I met that day
that I really wanted to be friends with.

202
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,520
Are you guilt-tripping me
into being nice about myself?

203
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,800
Even if things don't work out
with you and Elle,

204
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,000
even if you make mistakes sometimes,

205
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,400
you're a good person who deserves love.

206
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,640
Wait, isn't that for you and Nick?

207
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,320
No.

208
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,720
People might think you gave me this hickey
if you keep this up.

209
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,000
So? Might help to deflect the rumors.

210
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,320
Guys, come on.
We need to get to the Louvre.

211
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,160
I'm gonna…

212
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,800
- Hey. Wait up.
- You okay?

213
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,440
 You have until 5:00 p.m.,

214
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,120
and if any of you gets lost,
we will be leaving you here

215
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,680
to get locked in.

216
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,600
 Okay?

217
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,600
- Where's that Mona Lisa girl?
-Let's go!

218
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,640
Guys, we've gotta get a selfie with it.
Everyone pose for me now.

219
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,880
Wait! That's the Mona Lisa?

220
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,520
That's it? It's rubbish!

221
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,320
What? Darcy, it's art!

222
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,320
-You can't say that.
-Let's get another photo.

223
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,760
Look, look, look! Quick!
Show me your Mona face.

224
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,280
 Silly! 

225
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,280
I reckon I'd look absolutely great
in, like, a gilded, golden frame.

226
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,320
Stunning and glowing
and looking spectacular.

227
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,400
 I'd be so incredibly mugged off
if I posed for a painting,

228
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,640
and they just painted the back of my head.

229
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,360
- Come on!
- Wait, wait! Wait for me!

230
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:49,560
I don't think I really understand
any of the art, but… it's nice to look at.

231
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,040
 You don't always need
to understand it to enjoy it.

232
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,200
This one feels kinda romantic.

233
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,360
-Yeah.
-Mm.

234
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,920
 Guess that's true
of real life as well.

235
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
What is?

236
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,120
Like…

237
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,440
You don't have to understand your feelings
completely to know you like something.

238
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,720
You don't have to always
have figured everything out.

239
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,680
You can just

240
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,760
feel.

241
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,200
-What?
- Come on.

242
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,400
-Come on!
-Wait, where are we going?

243
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,480
No idea!

244
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,280
 I can't run!

245
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,240
Hey.

246
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,640
- Hey.
-What are you looking at?

247
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,320
 Just a painting.

248
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,200
 Wait!

249
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,600
What?

250
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,680
I just love being here.

251
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,440
You don't wanna go back to the others?

252
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,200
No.

253
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,840
 No, it's so fast! 

254
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,000
I think we're there 'cause I think it was…

255
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:24,320
We've already walked past the Mona Lisa
so we're at that one, aren't we?

256
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,520
Which means that if we go up these stairs,
we can see the Greek sta… tues.

257
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,640
I should probably tell you,
when we were on the Eiffel Tower,

258
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,880
he said that he still liked you.

259
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,720
Like, he genuinely thinks he still has
a chance of getting back with you.

260
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,800
He doesn't. 

261
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,560
Yeah.

262
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,560
Right.

263
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,520
Shall we get going? 

264
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,840
Charlie? 

265
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,600
-Come on, you lot.
- Come on.

266
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,480
 I think I look just like her.
Isn't it?

267
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,560
Do I not have the same physique?
The same drama?

268
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,200
-Do the pose, then I'll see.
-Okay.

269
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,840
Oh, your mum text you.

270
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,920
Wow, okay.

271
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,720
It's nothing.
Let's take a photo with this one.

272
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,800
How come I've never even met your parents?

273
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,440
I don't know. Come on.

274
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,720
Why do you always do that?
Why do you always avoid the issue?

275
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,880
Sometimes, I feel like
you're hiding stuff from me.

276
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,120
Well, I'm not.

277
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,800
I've never met your parents,
I've never been to your house, and…

278
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,440
you didn't even wanna
say "I love you" back.

279
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,040
It was just a casual "I love you."

280
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,240
You said you didn't mean it like that.

281
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,880
But you know I did.

282
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,080
You know I do.

283
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,560
What they do
to make those statues so accurate.

284
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,960
Like, back in the day,
all they had was just a big bit of rock.

285
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,280
-And a carving tool. What would it be?
- Like a chisel.

286
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,920
- A chisel.
- Yeah.

287
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,960
 But how did they do it
with just a chisel?

288
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,320
-Hey.
-Hey.

289
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,360
- They're not frightened.
-

290
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,680
- Exactly.
-Nick.

291
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,280
Charlie, what's wrong?

292
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,640
-Charlie?
-I don't…

293
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,040
I don't feel very well.

294
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,840
- Somebody get Mr. Farouk!
- Nick!

295
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,280
- Charlie?
- Charlie?

296
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,760
I thought this trip would be awful.

297
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,080
But… I think it's my favorite holiday yet.

298
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,280
Really?

299
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,040
Wow.

300
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,720
It's so beautiful here.

301
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,840
It makes me want to draw.

302
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,520
You should.

303
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,760
I love watching you draw.

304
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,400
The building is just so… cinematic.

305
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,360
They should make more movies
in the Louvre.

306
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,160
I can only think of The Da Vinci Code,

307
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,320
and you would literally
have to tie me to a chair

308
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,320
if you wanted me to watch
that actual monstrosity aga…

309
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,680
 Oh my God.

310
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,680
-Elle, wait.
-I'm so sorry.

311
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,760

I don't see it.

Stand in front of it.
I'll show you. Go on.

335
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,200
And do the pose as well.

336
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,520
-I don't do poses.
-Yes, you do. Go on.

337
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,680
 Now the facial expression.

338
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,680
-Mr. Farouk, Mr. Ajayi!
-Charlie fainted.

339
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,240
What just happened?

340
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,840
You just, um…

341
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,520
You passed out.

342
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,880
Onto your boyfriend though, so all good.

343
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:23,920
Are you okay?

344
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,440
Yeah, just

345
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,600
really embarrassed.

346
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,800
 We found them!

347
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,280
Charlie, are you all right?

348
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,360
Are you sure you feel okay, Charlie?

349
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,800
Yeah, I just haven't eaten enough today.

350
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,040
If you need to sit down
or you just wanna rest on the coach,

351
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,040
that's fine.

352
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,600
 There.

353
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,280
 Right.
We'll let you chill out a bit.

354
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,560
Yeah. Thanks.

355
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,600
Charlie.

356
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,480
I've noticed
you, uh, don't really eat a lot.

357
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,000
Um… Generally.

358
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,120
Or…

359
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,320
I don't know. It kinda feels
like it's gotten worse lately?

360
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,680
Like, I feel like
you eat less than you used to.

361
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:29,920
Yeah.

362
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,880
-I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
-Hey, no.

363
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,000
You have nothing to be sorry about.
I just…

364
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,560
I wanna understand.

365
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,080
I know I don't eat like normal people.

366
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:58,520
Some days I'm fine,
but other days I feel like I need to…

367
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,280
control it.

368
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,440
I used to do it a lot last year,
when everything at school was really bad.

369
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,000
Sometimes it feels like
the only thing I can control in my life.

370
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,800
That makes zero sense.
You can forget I said--

371
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,760
It does make sense.

372
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,960
Okay, maybe I don't totally get it, but…

373
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,120
I still wanna know
if you're feeling like that.

374
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,600
If you're having a bad day,

375
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:36,160
or… if there's anything that I can do
to make things less stressful.

376
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,040
Cheering you up.

377
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,680
I'm your boyfriend, Charlie.

378
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,400
And I…

379
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,240
I really care about you.

380
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,120
-It's a bit dry.
-

381
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,760
You are not rejecting the croissant
that I lovingly carried for you all day.

382
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,320
 Wow.

383
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,240
- Yeah.
- This… 

384
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,280
This is so…

385
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,080
Oh, it's my dad. Um…

386
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,760
-Sorry, I'd better…
-Your dad?

387
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,600
 Hello? Dad?

388
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,760
Yeah. I'm good. I'm at the Louvre.

389
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,120
Are we meeting up this week?

390
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,200
Oh, really?

391
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,720
No. I can do that.

392
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,880
Okay. See you soon.

393
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,800
 Bye.

394
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,920
Okay. Sorry about that. He said, um…

395
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,240
What?

396
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,480
You speak French.

397
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,360
Like, fluently.

398
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,880
Sort of. Um…

399
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,480
My dad's French, and he basically
only speaks to me in French, so…

400
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:22,440
Anyway, he lives in Paris,
so I've been trying to…

401
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,640
Are you… Wait, do you like
the fact that I speak French?

402
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,760
Oh…

403
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,880
-It's fine.
-

404
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,600
-It's cool.
-Charlie!

405
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,320
Mon amour.

406
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,320
-Oh my God, you're so cringe!
-You don't look like you're cringing.

407
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,600
-You look like you're blushing.
-I am not!

408
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,760
-Oh yeah? Sure?
-Leave me alone, you dick! Oh!

409
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,880
 No!

410
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,480
No. None of that here.

411
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,440
- Run!
-

412
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,800
- Where are we actually going?
- This way!

413
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,280
 Come on!

414
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,560
My dad wants to meet up, like, today.

415
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,360
You never mentioned your dad before.

416
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,600
I mean…

417
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,600
He's not really
a big part of my life anymore,

418
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,320
since he lives here, and…

419
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,040
he's not the most reliable.

420
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,040
He's still my dad, so…

421
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,480
I had this idea that I might

422
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,080
introduce you to him.

423
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,200
Yeah?

424
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,280
Yeah.

425
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,640
It's just hard to get in touch with him
when he never answers my texts.

426
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,920
How about

427
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,400
we promise to tell each other
when we've got stuff going on?

428
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,520
Deal.

429
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:33,520
When are you actually
meeting up with him? And how?

430
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,600
I said I'd meet him
in a café in 20 minutes.
