00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,840
-How did it go?
-Really well.

00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,560
She was completely fine with it.

Yeah.

35
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,640
Kissing at school is a terrible idea.

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,280
-I've never--
-I saw you.

37
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,280
One of the first things
I ever said to you…

38
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,120
-You're not gonna get distracted.
-Yes, I will.

39
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,480
-Hi.
-Hi.

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,040
-Hey.
-Hey.

41
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,200
- Argh, just let me win, Charlie!
- Yes!

42
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,880
I can't do this anymore!

43
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,200
I'm sorry!

44
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,560
-That was uncalled for.
-I was here first.

45
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,440
-Um, really?
-Yeah.

46
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,880
-We're in my room.
-I was here…

47
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,880
Oh no. This is war!

48
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,840
Come on!

49
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,960
What?

50
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,920
No, stop tickling me. Stop it!

51
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,160
Hi.

52
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,160
Hi.

53
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,920
-Hi.
-Hi.

54
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,160
Go on then.

55
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,280
 Cheers, love.

56
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,040
You're making me feel
really single right now.

57
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,680
I have a boyfriend!

58
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,680
Yes, we're all fully aware!

59
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,440
And he's amazing.

60
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,960
-I mean…
-Tao!

61
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,280
 Yeah, he's okay.

62
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,360
 And he wants to come out.

63
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,320
To some of his friends at least.

64
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,880
 Um… I thought
he wasn't speaking to the rugby lads

65
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,320
after the fight with Harry.

66
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,320
 He's not,
but I'm gonna help him.

67
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,240
 Okay.

68
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,840
Well, as long as you're both fine with it,
and you're looking out for each other,

69
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,360
I'm sure it'll be fine.

70
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,280
 Tao Xu!

71
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,680
Are you giving Charlie
relationship advice?

72
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,320
-Ah!  Rude!
-

73
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,560
 I know about relationships.
I watch a lot of romance movies, so…

74
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,640
 Mm.

75
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,200
Uh…

76
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,760
Excuse me.

77
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,120
-You're excused.
-No!

78
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,880
-
-Excuse me. Uh… N… No.

79
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,120
-You have it.
-No.

80
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,280
-You won. Fair and square.
-No. Take it.

81
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,200
No.

82
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,320
Tao!

83
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,680
 Get it! Get it!

84
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,320
 Hey, Nick!

85
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,600
Here comes Captain Dipstick.

86
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,720
Nicholas!

87
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,600
Imogen.

88
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,640
Are you okay?

89
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,240
I have something very important
to show you.

90
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,800
Okay.

91
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,160
I named him Brooklyn because
that's where I want to live someday,

92
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,160
and I want him to meet Nellie
so they can be best friends!

93
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,800
He's absolutely adorable.

94
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,840
We're still friends, aren't we?
I promise I don't fancy you anymore.

95
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,720
Yeah. I still wanna be friends.

96
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,200
Okay, good.

97
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,200
-Also, I fancy someone else now.
-Really?

98
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,960
Who?

99
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,600
Okay, fine, don't tell me.
We've been friends since Year 7, but…

100
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,640
If anything actually happens,
I promise I'll tell you.

101
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,360
And if you have any romantic developments,
I want to hear all about them.

102
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,360
Oh my God,
I forgot to show you this one. Look.

103
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,120
I got Brooklyn to roll over.

104
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,640
Happy Monday, Truham Grammar,

105
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,320
or perhaps not so happy for our Year 11s

106
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:16,600
as I regret to inform you that two weeks
of GCSE study hall starts today.

107
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,880
Exam season is nigh.

108
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,080
-Quiet! 
-

109
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,560
For those of you who don't know me,
my name is Mr. Farouk.

110
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,920
I normally teach science,
but for the next couple of weeks,

111
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,400
I'll be supervising
your independent GCSE revision.

112
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,920
My rules are simple.

113
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:18,640
No chatting,
no phones, no annoying questions.

114
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,520
Break my rules, and you go
straight to isolation for the day.

115
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,840
Nicholas Nelson.

116
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,320
Why don't I let you off with a warning
as I hadn't finished listing my rules?

117
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,520
If I catch you with that phone again,
I'll be confiscating it.

118
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,160
Do you understand?

119
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,200
Yes, sir.

120
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,160
Good.

121
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,720
A'ight, I think
we're gonna get on just fine.

122
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,680
- Yusef.
-Yes, sir.

123
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,960
- Jim.
-Here.

124
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,080
- Maximilian.
-Here.

125
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,800
- Stuart.
-Here, sir.

126
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,480
- Addison.
-Here, sir.

127
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,040
- William.
-Here, sir.

128
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,160
 Nicholas.

129
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,600
- Todd.
-Here, sir.

130
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,240
- Leah.
-Here.

131
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,760
- Warren.
-Here, sir.

132
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,680
 Charlie.

133
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,680
Here, sir.

134
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,200
- Toby.
-Here, sir.

135
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,040
- Paul.
-Here, sir.

136
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,240
 Dennis.

137
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,520
Are you just gonna ignore me
for two weeks then?

138
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,920
-I didn't even do anything to you.
-Don't talk to me.

139
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,360
I said sorry to Charlie for what happened.

140
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,480
-Don't talk about him.
-Wow.

141
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,840
You know,
if you're trying to keep it quiet,

142
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,480
you should probably
stop acting so gay for him.

143
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,720
I seem to remember
saying something about no chatting.

144
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,560
-
-Come in!

145
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,960
I want to rejoin the rugby team.

146
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,440
You know you don't have to do this
if you don't want to.

147
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,400
I want to.

148
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,280
Otherwise we'll barely see each other
this term.

149
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,160
-And I've missed rugby.
-

150
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,280
-Have you now?
-Yeah.

151
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,280
I love running around and falling over.

152
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,360
Oh, well, you are very good
at the falling over part.

153
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,160
I'm good at the running part,
too, actually.

154
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,520
What, running away from the ball?

155
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,800
-Okay, well, if you don't want me here…
-Oh, no, no, no, no. Come on.

156
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,440
I need you.

157
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,480
Oi! Are you coming back to rugby?

158
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,920
-Yeah.
-Yes, lad.

159
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,880
Come on then.

160
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,080
- Go on then, pass it.
- Touch warm-up!

161
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,240
You all right, Nick?

162
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,840
What? Are you still in a mood with us?

163
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,040
 Let's go, lads.
You've all been playing like girls lately.

164
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,040
-
-Harry, cross! Cross!

165
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,400
 Wide! Nice and wide!

166
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,120
 Charlie, pass the ball!
Let's go. Let's go.

167
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,200
And again! And again!

168
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,880
- Nick!
- Nick!

169
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,640
 Nick, you're meant
to pass the ball!

170
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,480
- Come on.
- You had an overlap.

171
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,520
- I was open!
-Why aren't you guys playing like a team?

172
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,040
-Set up.
- Pass the ball!

173
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,480
-Can we set up?
-Leave it, Otis. Leave it.

174
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,400
Leave it. Come on.

175
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,040
-Let's go again!
- We don't want another St. John's.

176
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,680
Elle, listen, you deserve
to have the perfect romance.

177
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,640
 Exactly.

178
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,360
Like us.

179
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,600
 But Tao is literally
the worst person to have a crush on.

180
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,000
Sometimes I think he might like me back,

181
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,640
but other times it's…

182
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,920
It's probably just Tao being weird.

183
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,160
But maybe being weird
is how he expresses his romantic feelings.

184
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,880
Personally, I can relate to that.

185
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,400
What if you tried
actually flirting with him?

186
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,000
-Just to see what happens.
- Yeah, flirt with him.

187
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,840
You're quiet today.

188
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,600
-What's up?
-Nothing. Everything's normal.

189
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,960
Normal? Okay.

190
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,120
My mum's been moaning at me
to get a haircut.

191
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,400
Your hair's cute long.

192
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,160
But it'd look cute short too.

193
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,480
-
-You should do what you want.

194
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,880
 That's my mum.

195
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,720
I'll see you tomorrow.

196
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,160
- …starting lineup on Sunday.
- If no one passes, we won't win.

197
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,920
I got you a present.

198
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,280
What? Why?

199
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,880
Because… we've been going out
for two months.

200
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,400
As in, it's our two-month anniversary?

201
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,040
It sounds silly when you say it like that.

202
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,960
-No, no, it doesn't.
-And now I'm embarrassed.

203
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,360
No! Look. Um…

204
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,280
I… I did not get you a present.

205
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,000
It's okay. I didn't want it
to become a thing, so…

206
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,280
It could be a thing.

207
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,760
And how did you know
this is my favorite chocolate bar?

208
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,320
Uh…

209
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,280
You mentioned it ages ago, so…

210
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,360
Thank you.

211
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,440
-
-

212
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,160
And that's why
we shouldn't kiss at school.

213
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,840
Oh, but kissing's so fun.

214
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,960
But you getting outed
because we get caught kissing is not.

215
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,880
I… I want to tell people.

216
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,960
You know, like Imogen. I just…

217
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,720
It's hard to find the right time.

218
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,200
You don't have to tell everyone,
or anyone, if you don't want to.

219
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,600
-You're making me wanna kiss you again.
-I'm being serious.

220
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,720
So am I.

221
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,080
Hey.

222
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,240
If we're out by the time
we're on the Paris trip, we can, uh…

223
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,200
kiss on the Eiffel Tower.

224
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,080
No more kissing at school.

225
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,600
It's too risky.

226
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,480
-Are you staying to hang out with us?
-I will be going upstairs.

227
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,920
Mum and Dad
hardly ever go away at weekends.

228
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,080
-You can invite some of your friends over.
-I treasure my alone time.

229
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,000
Why exactly did you purchase
the entire Tesco snack aisle?

230
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,000
 It's a sleepover.
We need snacks.

231
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,400
And everything about tonight
needs to be perfect.

232
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,280
Are you getting graded for it?

233
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,760
I'm helping Nick come out
to one of his oldest friends.

234
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,600
 Hi.

235
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,320
- I made cupcakes.
- Wow. Well done. Proud of you.

236
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,600
 It's very unlike me.

237
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,760
 We have a snack table
you can put them on.

not a poetry recital.

351
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,920
 I will, after you tell me
what béarnaise sauce is.

352
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,200
 Again,
why didn't you ask me this

353
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,840
before you started making it?

354
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,080
-Charlie, can I use your bathroom?
-Yeah, sure.

355
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,240
Um… I'll show you where it is.

356
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,680
 I'm not supposed
to be approachable.

357
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:00,000
You've got a lot of people
relying on you and looking up to you.

358
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,320
It wouldn't hurt you to be…

359
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,560
- Yes!
- Tell her.

360
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,720
Go on!

361
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,080
That's the, uh… That's the bathroom there.

362
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,160
 Oh. Cool, thanks.

363
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,320
Imogen, um…

364
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:27,280
I… I kind of have something
that I… I wanna tell you.

365
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,800
Well, it's…

366
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,000
It's kind of hard to--

367
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,880
Is it about you and Charlie?

368
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,880
Oh my God.

369
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,080
I should've let you say it.

370
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,600
It's just… it is kinda obvious.

371
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:47,000
And, like, it totally makes sense.
Like, the whole date thing

372
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,680
and the sports-day thing.

373
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,640
You didn't like me because you're gay.

374
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,200
Uh…

375
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,000
Well, I… I'm bisexual actually.

376
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,360
-Oh.
-Yeah.

377
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,560
I'm sorry.
I don't actually know how to react.

378
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,000
This is… This is good.

379
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,800
Okay, well, now you know about Charlie,
you have to tell me about your crush.

380
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,440
-
-Oh, come on.

381
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,440
It's only fair.

382
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,480
Ugh, fine, okay.

383
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,000
It's Ben.

384
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,920
 I'm so cozy right now.

385
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,480
I'm gonna fall asleep so quick.

386
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,200
-
-

387
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,960
 The flirting didn't work.

388
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,040
I think I need to try and get over him.

389
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,480
 Oh, Elle.

390
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,120
Oh.

391
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,360
-Bye, Charlie.
-Bye!

392
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,640
-Thank you.
-Thank you for coming. Bye.

393
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,560
-Bye.
-Bye.

394
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,320
-Every time.
-Every time.

395
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,560
-Every time.
-Every time.

396
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,880
- Bye!
- Bye.

397
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,240
 Bye.

398
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,560
I can't believe
people think you're straight.

399
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,680
 Silly.

400
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,160
 But, yeah, let's go.

401
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,400
-Bye.
-Bye.

402
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,880
- Ah, I think my mum's here.
- Oh. Let's go and see.

403
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,600
 I signed that form
for the Paris trip.

404
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,520
-It's on the fridge.
- Oh, thanks.

405
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,840
 Are all your friends
going too?

406
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:14,360
Yeah. It's a joint
Truham-Higgs language students trip.

407
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,160
Well, then, your Spanish GCSE
will come in very useful.

408
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,000
-You know my friend Nick?
- Yes.

409
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,520
I thought I probably should tell you…

410
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,320
He's my boyfriend.

411
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,920
You're surprised.

412
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,320
Uh, well, I… You know…

413
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:52,320
He's a very sporty, laddish sort of boy.
I j-- I wouldn't have assumed he was gay.

414
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,680
Being gay has nothing to do with that.

415
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,560
And actually, he's bisexual.

416
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,400
Gay or bisexual, uh,

417
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:03,080
Nick is… banned from sleepovers
from now on.

418
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,000
What?

419
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,760
Yeah, there will be no hanky-panky
in this house.

420
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,600
Please don't say "hanky-panky."

421
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,800
And I suppose
Nick's going on this Paris trip as well?

422
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,800
Yeah.

423
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,240
So that's why you've been talking about it
nonstop for weeks.

424
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,520
-Bedroom door open at all times.
- I'm leaving.

425
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,000
-No hanky-panky till you're married.
-Stop saying "hanky-panky."

426
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,400
-What…
- No. Mm.

427
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,520
-
-

428
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,960
You're telling people then?

429
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,880
Yeah.

430
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,640
 And you're not worried?

431
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,520
About what?

432
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,040
About getting bullied again?

433
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,480
It's not gonna be like when I got outed.

434
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,760
We just want people
to know we're together.

435
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:52,600
I'm gonna do everything I can to make sure
Nick doesn't have to deal with what I did.
