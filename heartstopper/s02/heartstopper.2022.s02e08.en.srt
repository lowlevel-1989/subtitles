I told you!

96
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,640
- I didn't believe you.
- I said, didn't I?

97
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,360
Do you wanna stop
and get something to eat?

98
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,400
-We can walk to the shop.
-I'll eat later.

99
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,520

103
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,320

104
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,880

105
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,720
I saw your Instagram post.

106
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,560
-Yeah.
-And the comments.

107
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,840
They're all idiots
for assuming you're straight.

108
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,800
And I'm including myself
in that statement.

109
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,880
Thanks.

110
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,080
Charlie must be really happy.

111
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,040
In some ways. Yeah.

112
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,280
I mean, he…
he says he's really happy, but…

113
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,840
I don't know. I think he's been finding
all the attention, like, a lot.

114
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,400
Well, yeah. He hates attention, so…

115
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,120
I'm just worried.

116
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,960
How come?

117
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,160
I think…

118
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,920
the more I learn about him,

119
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,160
the more I think

120
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:21,600
that the bullying and all the things
that happened to him in the past,

121
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,960
they all really affected him.

122
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,360
And… And he still carries it all with him.

123
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,760
Even though it's over.

124
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,520
It still causes him a lot of pain.

125
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,520
-I don't know. Do you think that's true?
-Yeah. Yeah, I… I do.

126
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,800
I think when something really bad happens,
it can affect you for a really long time.

127
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,560
Like,

128
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,600
my dad died when I was 12, and,

129
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,480
you know,

130
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,240
I think a lot of the reason I get
so freaked out about losing my friends

131
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,680
and… losing Elle

132
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,720
is because losing him was just, like…

133
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,440
Yeah.

134
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,120
-I… I didn't know about your dad.
-Oh.

135
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,000
Don't… Don't be weird about it.

136
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,720
-I'll try.
-Good.

137
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,840
You know the bullying?
You know how bad it was, don't you?

138
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,600
 I mean,
I heard some stuff, but, um,

139
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,320
yeah, Charlie never really
talked to me about it.

140
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,920
Me neither.

141
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,440
- Can you close your eyes?
-Why?

142
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,760
 Because I'm nervous
you'll think I look weird.

143
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,400
 Okay. I'm not looking,

144
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,320

I think you always look cute.

146
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,800
I can't believe you're my boyfriend.

147
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,000
Can I please open my eyes now?

148
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,360
Okay.

149
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,960

00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,720
Thank God. I'm on my way.
Are you sure she's okay?

351
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,480
 Oh, guys.

352
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,680
-Love you guys.
- Love you lots.

353
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,240
 Oh my God, look.
Tiny Nick was so cute!

354
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,840
Where did you sleep?

355
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,600
I just… I went to the park.

356
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,680
It was fine. Nobody was there.

357
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,840
Why didn't you text me?

358
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,680
My phone was out of battery,
and I didn't have a charger.

359
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,400
Why didn't you walk to my house?

360
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,400
Because I didn't want you to know.

361
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,680
Do you remember when we got locked
in the music room the second time?

362
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,840
Yeah.

363
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,000
You told me

364
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,520
that you didn't feel as confident
about being a lesbian as I did,

365
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,480
and I wanted to be that person for you,
to help you through your journey.

366
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,000
But you are that person.

367
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,120
At school. Maybe.

368
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,800
 I'm not even out
to my own parents.

369
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,520
I don't think I ever will be.

370
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:05,440
I… hide who I am when I'm at home.

371
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,280
I'm not confident.

372
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,840
Sometimes my mum makes me hate myself.

373
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,040
But then you said, "I love you."

374
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,920
But… what if that person
doesn't even exist?

375
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,320
So… you were scared to say it back

376
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,040
because you didn't really believe
that I could love you?

377
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,040
You've only ever seen half of my life.

378
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,560
Now I'm seeing the other half.

379
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,280
And I still love you.

380
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,280
Are you sure? 'Cause…

381
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,240
I'm a literal disaster.

382
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,440
Oh, I know.

383
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,760
I actually like
how much of a disaster you are.

384
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I am

385
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,280
so in love with you.

386
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,320
I just… I'm bad at saying it.

387
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,520
Well, practice makes perfect.

388
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,920
I love you.

389
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,280
I love you.

390
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,920
I. Love. You.

391
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,760

-My plan's been foiled.
-

448
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,600
You've got so many rugby trophies.

449
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,240
 That one's from summer camp.

450
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,080
You went to rugby summer camp?

451
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,600
When I was 12.
I think I had a crush on the instructor.

452
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,320
 Oh my God.

453
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,680
You know, I didn't realize it at the time,
but looking back now,

454
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,560
I was obsessed with him,
so I tried really, really hard

455
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,680
and, uh, got that trophy
for being the best team player.

456
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,600
That is so adorable!

457
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,240
Now your turn.

458
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,200
What?

459
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,000
Tell me something.

460
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,080
Like what?

461
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,800
You never told me about…

462
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,840
the bullying.

463
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,560
What that was like.

464
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,040
We don't need to talk about that.

465
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,200
Everything's fine now.

466
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,960
Is everything fine?

467
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:58,240
I know you like everything to be fine
and happy and perfect all the time,

468
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,240
but you don't have to be perfect with me.

469
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:11,760
Charlie, we said
we'd tell each other things.

470
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:16,800
After you told me
about your… eating thing.

471
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,440
Someone just heard Tao
talking about me coming out.

472
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,880
I think it surprised me
how homophobic people were.

473
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,360
I thought things were better nowadays.

474
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,840
People would just
call me disgusting to my face.

475
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,520
And it went on for so long

476
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,120
that I think I started
to believe what they were saying.

477
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,080
It made me really hate myself.

478
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,400
So much that I…

479
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:16,880
I used to…

480
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,760
I used to cut myself sometimes.

481
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,960
I don't wanna feel like that anymore.

482
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,040
 Do you still do that now?

483
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,680
 No.

484
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,800
Sorry.

485
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,720
I thought we'd banned the S word.

486
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,120
Can you promise to tell me

487
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,560
if it ever gets that bad again?

488
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,120
I just don't wanna annoy you
or burden you.

489
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:29,120
I don't want you to think
I'm some fragile, broken mess.

490
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:33,400
Like you need to fix me.
I would hate that.

491
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,480
You're not, and I wouldn't.

492
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,400
But I've done so many things
that were scary in the past few months

493
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,240
because you were there, holding my hand.

494
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,560
And I wanna be that for you too.

495
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,640
Like,

496
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,320
you're my boyfriend.

497
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,560
Char,

498
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,080
can you just please,

499
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,880
please promise me?

500
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,760
Okay.

501
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,160
I love your hair so much.

502
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,680
Nick. I really need to go.

503
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,000
I love your eyes.

00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,960
