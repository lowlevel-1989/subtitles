Charlie's always been a high achiever,
but in the past few months,

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,160
his grades have been slipping
across most of his subjects.

5
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,720
Been a bit distracted, haven't you?

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,400
Tao, I've been getting the sense

7
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,000
that you've been struggling
with your coursework.

8
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,320
Struggling?

9
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,240
How?

10
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,320
Well…

11
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,240
I haven't been Nick's teacher for long,

12
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,120
but he's on track
for solid grades in his GCSEs.

13
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,120
As long as he keeps on
focusing on his schoolwork,

14
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,760
he'll be fine.

15
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,240
That's good, isn't it?

16
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,720
Isaac's grades are always excellent.

17
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,280
But I'd like to see him participate more.

18
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,720
And he's such a pleasure to have in class.

19
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,040
He's set for top grades in his GCSEs.

20
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,840
He's failed to hand in
several homework assignments.

21
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,640
 He's been late to class.

22
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,440
You still haven't completed
your history coursework essay.

23
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,640
If you don't finish it,
then that'll be a fail grade.

24
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,480
You need to start focusing
on your schoolwork.

25
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,680
♪ It's the end of an era ♪

26
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,960

28
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,240
So, your coursework essay.

29
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,000
-It's fine. I'll get it done.
-Yeah, but it's not just that, is it?

30
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,280
I know getting your first boyfriend
is very exciting, but--

31
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,920
-What? It's not Nick's fault.
-Charlie!

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,800
You've been going
'round each other's houses

33
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,440
almost every day for weeks, Charlie.

34
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,680
It's no wonder
you haven't done your coursework.

35
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,360
I've still got a few weeks to finish it!

36
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,600
Well, I think you and Nick
need to spend some time apart.

37
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,560
That's not fair!

38
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,080
We are not banning you
from seeing each other completely.

39
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,680
No, it needs to be a complete ban.

40
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,320
Until this coursework essay is handed in,

41
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,320
Nick is not allowed 'round our house,
and you are not allowed 'round his.

Oh, hello. Good girl.

47
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,600
- Mum, make me one!
- Not if you ask like that, David.

48
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,720
 Please?

49
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,520
 No one happy to see me?

50
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,960
 Gonna stay with Dad next time, eh?

51
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,440
We're all very happy
you're back from uni, darling.

52
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,480
What've you been up to since Christmas?
Got a… girlfriend yet?

53
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,240
-I'll take that as an obvious no.
-Stop bothering him, David.

54
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,440
I borrowed your Nintendo Switch,
by the way.

55
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,160
-Please don't tell him about Charlie.
-I won't, darling. Don't worry.

56
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,560
Hi.

57
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,920
Why do you never do your homework?

58
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,640
- I'll do it next week.
-Fine.

59
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,680
- Please help.
-I think I have the answers.

60
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:22,920
 Elle!

61
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,360
Have you heard? Year 11 Prom is happening.

62
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,120
Oh my God! Prom?

63
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,320
 I'm so excited!

64
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,320
You could totally wear a suit.
You'd look amazing.

65
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,680
-You mean we can't be Fiona and Shrek?
-

66
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,600
It's prom, not Halloween!

67
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,880
-Hey, are you guys talking about the prom?
- Yeah.

68
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,160
 Oh, so Miss Greenwood's
put me in charge of organizing it,

69
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,680
and I'm kind of looking for some help.

70
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,920
I'm really excited,
but I don't think I can do this alone.

71
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,440
Oh my God, yes! I'm so in!

72
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,280
Do you wanna meet with us for lunch?
We can start making a mood board?

73
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,560
I mean, yeah. I've got some ideas already.
I'm thinking classic.

74
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,320
- That ties in with my dress.
- No, theme's a great idea.

75
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,680
But then the blue will make, like,
everyone's outfits look, like, amazing!

76
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,760
Personally, I think
that prom should be pirate themed.

77
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,760
No, Sahar's already decided
that we're doing a classic prom theme.

78
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,840
But if I could bring a sword to prom,
I'm totally up for it.

79
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,960
No!

80
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,240
Tao wants to meet up tonight.

81
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,240
-Oh my God. Say yes!
- No!

82
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,400
Elle, you need
to put some distance between you.

83
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,000
You could make your move.
This is your chance!

84
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,680
Wait, there's a boy?

85
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:36,120
There is a boy, but Elle told us
she wanted to get over him.

86
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,520
 He's my best friend, and…

87
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,800
-Give me your phone. I'll send him a text.
-Guys! It's fine.

88
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,720
I'm going to the open evening tonight
anyway, so I can't.

89
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,360
Okay…

90
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,800
A photo booth. Brilliant idea.

91
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,520
 Miss said
we don't have the budget.

92
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,960
It doesn't have to be, like, real.
We can just get a box or something

93
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,840
and, like, a stand,
and put cool things in it like the ribbon.

94
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,160
 Paint everyone.

95
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,480
We could make Elle paint everyone
instead of photos, then it's free.

96
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,640
 Nick Nelson!

97
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,440
 Hey.

98
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,000
Hey.

99
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,600
I told Mr. Farouk I borrowed your pen
and needed to give it back.

100
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,320
 Okay.

101
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:47,560
I just haven't seen you all day,
so I wanted to say hi.

102
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,320
Hi.

103
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,160
Are you okay?
With your brother and everything?

104
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,240
Yeah.

105
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,960
Just…

106
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,080
 This ain't social hour, boys!

107
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,960
Text me later.

108
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,320
Yeah.

109
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,600
 I see he's still
as desperate as ever.

110
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,360
-I told you not to talk about him.
-God, you hate me so much.

111
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,800
It's not my fault he liked me before you.

112
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,560
I hate you
because you literally assaulted him.

113
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,560
Right, I told you my rules.

114
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,840
Now you're in here
till the end of the day.

115
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,560
I don't particularly care
if you fail your maths GCSE on Monday,

116
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,480
but I ain't gonna let you
disrupt everyone else's study time.

117
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,640
Fix up, man.

118
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,080
That was just a misunderstanding.

119
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,920
It wasn't though.

120
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,880
-I was going through some personal stuff.
-I don't care.

121
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,680
You hurt him, and who knows
if you'll do the same with Imogen.

122
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,760
Do you even like her?

123
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,600
Sorry, am I not allowed
to like girls as well as boys?

124
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,680
-Charlie know you don't wanna come out?
-I do want to come out.

125
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,520
 Right. I'll believe that
when I see it.

126
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,760
Charlie thinks
you're this perfect boyfriend,

127
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,800
but you are just the same as me.

128
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,800
 Get out.

129
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,560
I'm just

130
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,640
checking to see
how the GCSE revision's going.

131
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,680
Can you get out? I'm trying to study.

132
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,920
-Charlie? Who's Charlie?
-Give that back!

133
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,240
-Your girlfriend?
-No. Stop it.

134
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,440
She's sending three love hearts.
You might be in there.

135
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,760
-David!
-God.

136
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,000
Fine.

137
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,400

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,720
Um… If you do have a girlfriend,
I wanna know about it.

140
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,880

 Guys!

181
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:38,160
 All right, guys, welcome
to the Lambert School of Art, everyone!

182
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,280
Sign up here
for the sixth-form open evening,

183
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,200
and then we can start the tour.

184
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,600
 This term, our Year 12s are
working on pieces about climate change,

185
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,960
which might be a great topic
for your application pieces

186
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,200
if you haven't started
working on them yet.

187
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,080
So just spread 'round.
Have a look at the art.

188
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:02,840
Not gonna lie, this is kind of making me
more nervous about my application piece.

189
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,080
I haven't finished mine yet.

190
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,560
-Oh, same.
-I haven't even started.

191
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,280
Oh my God, babe, same.

192
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:14,280
I bet they throw really good parties here.

193
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,840
Ignore Felix. They only wanna go here
for the parties.

194
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,320
They do throw really good parties here,
just so you know.

195
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,760
See? I knew it. It's an art-school thing.

196
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,200
I'm Naomi, by the way.

197
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,160
I'm Elle.

198
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,960
And this is Felix.

199
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,160
- Hey.
-Hey.

200
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,480
♪ When I say I'm having a little trouble ♪

201
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:38,000

202
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,880
I might not make it, but hopefully…

203
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,720
Yeah, honestly. Which one's yours?

204
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,920
 I can just tell
you're gonna fit in already.

205
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,560
-I'm so nervous.
- Don't be.

206
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,200
Three, two, one. Picasso.

207
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,960
-Picasso.
-Picasso. 

208
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,280
 I really hope I get in.

209
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,240
I hope we both get in.

210
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,600
We will.

211
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,160
-I'm speaking it into the universe.
-She's manifesting.

212
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,320
I just… hate being at a regular school.

213
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,680
Like, everyone knowing you
as the trans girl.

214
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,080
Here, I could just

215
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,200
be Naomi.

216
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,680
Do you know what I mean?

217
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,360
Yeah.

218
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,880
I really do.

219
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,000
 We'll still be able to take
you to the Wheel of Sadness afterwards,

220
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,840
but, of course,
we don't wanna take you there.

221
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,160
We wanna take you
onto the Mountain of Time.

222
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,680
Are you ready? Okay.

223
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,640
Will you please
show us the final question?

224
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,760
 Tao, why aren't you eating?

225
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,360
 I am eating.

226
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,040
What's so interesting on that phone?

227
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,120
 Nothing.

228
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,600
 Oh, is that Elle? 

229
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,840
Oh, she's so pretty!

230
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,240
She's at this art school open day thing.

231
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,080
She's applying for art college?

232
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,400
Yeah. For sixth form.

233
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,240
So she might be moving away?

234
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,920
I don't know. Maybe.

235
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,200
It's really far.

236
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:09,200
 We should invite her
for dinner sometime soon.

237
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,680
 Yeah.

238
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,840
 …correct answer.
What is the capital of Bulgaria?

239
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,760
 Sofia.

240
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,880
 It's Sofia!
Congratulations!

241
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,640
Nicholas! How are you feeling
about maths this morning?

242
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,360
I still don't get quadratic equations,
so I'm probably gonna fail.

243
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,280
Imogen.

244
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,280
Why are you dating Ben?

245
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,880
What do you mean?

246
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,800
He's a dick.
He's… He's done some really bad stuff.

247
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,920
What? What did he do?

248
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I can't tell you.

249
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,240
I've known him since primary school.
He's one of my oldest friends.

250
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,360
-Yeah, but--
-You know what?

251
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,640
I don't actually have that many friends.

252
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,080
But Ben is one of the few people
who actually likes me.

253
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,800
And he's been lovely to me,

254
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,360
so whatever happened in the past,
he's nicer now.

255
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,280
-And I really like him.
-Imogen--

256
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,640
Good luck in the exam.

257
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,400
-You all right? What's up?
-Nothing. It's fine.

258
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,480
It's none of his business.

259
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,120
And your exam starts

260
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,640
now!

261
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,040
You snuck out again? You'll be
in so much trouble with your mum.

262
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,640
I'm here to cheer you up
after your terrible exam.

263
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,800
-I think it's too short.
-Mum!

264
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,240
No, it's not.

265
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,080
You wanted my opinion, so there it is.

266
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,400
Well, Naomi said she loves it.

267
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,000
That boy of yours is here.

268
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,080
 Was your maths exam okay today?

269
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:21,200
Uh, Tao, you did not come here
just to ask me about my maths exam.

270
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,120
Uh…

271
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,520
No. Yeah, okay.

272
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,880
I guess

273
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,800
things have just been
kind of weird lately.

274
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,400
I… I mean… I've been a bit weird.

275
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,680
So I thought I'd come over and see
if you wanted to hang out this evening.

276
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,640
But I guess you can't.

277
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,920
I'm going out tonight
with Naomi and Felix.

278
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,760
We're going to a club
that does under-18 nights.

279
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,800
Club? Wow.

280
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,720
I know.

281
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,440
I might hate it.

282
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,640
Maybe we could have that art day
at the weekend or something?

283
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,560
I don't know. Uh…

284
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:13,040
Tao, honestly, I'm kind of busy.

285
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,760
Recently, I…

286
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:19,400
You know, with GCSEs and finishing
my application piece for Lambert, it…

287
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:20,920
Yeah.

288
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,560
Yeah, yeah. Uh… That's fine.

289
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,600
-Sorry.
-No. It's nothing to be sorry about.

290
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,040
Did I fall asleep?

291
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,680
Are you tired,
or is this movie just really boring?

292
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,440
I did warn you
I'm not a fan of Marvel movies.

293
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,200
Okay.

294
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,000
Do you want something to eat?

295
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,400
-I could make us some dinner.
-No. I'll have something when I get home.

296
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,560
I'd love a cup of tea though.

297
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,080
 You're such an old man!

298
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,000
Hey!

299
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,360
You're so cute.

300
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,560
You're so cute. 

301
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,960
Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle.

302
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,040
-Hi.
-

303
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:53,960
Hi.

304
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,280
What was your name, sorry?

305
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,640
I'm Charlie, and you're…

306
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,640
You're Charlie.

307
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,440
Right. Um, I'm David. Sorry.

308
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,240
So I'm… I'm Nick's older brother.

309
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,160
Yeah.

310
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,680
- Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

311
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,200
 And where did you two meet?

312
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,400
We're in the same form at school.

313
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,760
 David.

314
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,760
 There he is. Um…

315
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,000
I was just getting acquainted
with, um… with Charlie here.

316
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,800
 Yeah, well, we're busy,
so you can go away now.

317
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,440
Are you okay?

318
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,360
Yeah.

319
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:32,880
 I just…

320
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:37,440
I just wanted to meet the guy that,
you know, turned my little brother gay.

321
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,480
What?

322
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,440
I mean, I should've always known
you'd turn out to be gay.

323
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,720
I'm bi, actually, and so what?

324
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,160
"I'm bi, actually."

325
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,320
So… Look, if you're gonna be gay,
at least admit you're gay.

326
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,160
 Oh…

327
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,240
See, this is exactly
why I didn't wanna tell you!

328
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,280
- Too late now!
- This is ridiculous.

329
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,920
- I'm not allowed to be skeptical?
- No! You're not!

330
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,880
- Why?
- I knew you'd be like this!

331
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,560
-Like what?
-Like a homophobic prick!

332
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,280
-Boys, what is going on?
-Why did you tell him about Charlie?

333
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,200
-I didn't, darling.
-Mum didn't tell me.

334
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,560
You left a picture of you two kissing
on your bedroom wall.

335
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,400
Why do you keep going in my room?

336
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,360
Come on! Mum, he's saying he's bi.
What a load of absolute bullshit.

337
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,320
-David, please don't swear.
-He can't even admit he's gay.

338
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,520
I mean, I bet
you haven't told Dad yet, have you?

339
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,760
 Oh my God.
Imagine what Dad's gonna say.

340
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,280
-He's such… He's such a dick!
- I'm just being realistic.

341
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,520
Boys, that is enough.
David, in the kitchen now.

342
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,520
 Why are you winding him up
on purpose?

343
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,560
 I didn't do anything!
It's him getting wound up for no reason.

344
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,800
 What are you doing
going into his bedroom?

345
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,520
 I went in there one time!
If he didn't want me to know…

346
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,600
Should I go home?

347
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,320
- …where anyone could see it.
- You've got no right to…

348
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,080
 I'm sorry.

349
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,040
I'll text you later, okay?

350
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,600
Yeah.

351
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,640
It's fine.

352
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,280
Sorry.

353
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,800
-
- Charlie?

354
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,480
Where have you been?

355
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,600
Nick's, I assume.

356
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,400
I thought we'd agreed
you're gonna spend some time apart

357
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,960
until you'd finished your coursework.

358
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,040
He was worried about his exams.
I just wanted--

359
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,400
Yeah, I don't wanna hear it.
You're grounded for the rest of this term.

360
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,040
And don't even think about sneaking out,
or you won't be going on the Paris trip.

361
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,080
-
- Charlie.

362
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,040
-Do you want some dinner?
-No. I ate at Nick's.

I don't care what David thinks anyway.

I mean, it was never
gonna go perfectly with everyone.

386
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,480
Coming out to my mum was amazing,

387
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:56,040
but there are still awful people
in the world, like my brother.

388
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,440
Like, you know, when you came out.

389
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,240
But I can handle it.

00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,440

- I brought you apple.
-Thanks.

402
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,240
Are you sad about Elle?

403
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,240
Yeah. Kind of.

404
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,240
You remind me of me and Dad.

405
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,360
-What? Mum, that's so weird.
-

406
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,400
Well, he was the calm one,
and I was the outspoken one.

407
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,120
But when we were in the same room,

408
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,040
it was like perfect harmony.

409
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,560
And no matter what happened,
we'd both be okay.

410
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,560
So when we lost him,

411
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,680
I felt so unbalanced.

412
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,120
It was like falling off a cliff.

413
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,240
So I understand
if you're afraid of losing her.

414
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,960
If she's growing up and moving on.

415
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,480
While I'm stuck here. Same old Tao.

416
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,080
Same old Tao isn't so bad.

417
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,040
But if you're afraid of losing her,

418
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,280
you have to fight to stay by her side.

419
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,120
Yeah.

420
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
-Also, Elle's not dead, so there's that.
-

421
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,600
Oh well…

422
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,680
 Don't stay up late.
Sleep is important.

423
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,080
I like Elle. Okay?

424
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,240
 I said it.

425
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,440
And don't laugh!
I bet you've all been laughing

426
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,320
behind my back
because I've been so oblivious.

427
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,840
Honestly, Elle can do better,

428
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,560
and she probably
doesn't even like me back,

429
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,920
and this is probably
going to destroy our friendship,

430
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,160
it's going to destroy
our friendship group,

431
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,000
and it's going to leave me
devastated for years to come.

432
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,080
So this is a really selfish
and stupid thing to do,

433
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,960
but I'm going to tell her.

434
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,360
Help me.
