00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,810
Hello, everybody.
Thanks for coming.

2
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,682
I am the Lorax.
I speak for the trees.

3
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,525
And I'd like to say
a few words, if you please.

4
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,126
Regarding the story
that you're about to see

5
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,124
it actually happened.
Just take it from me.

6
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,204
But there's more to this story
than what's on the page,

7
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,364
so please pay attention
while I set the stage.

8
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,567
<i>We open in Thneedville, a city they
say that was plastic and fake,</i>

9
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,529
<i>and they liked it that way!</i>

10
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,446
<i>A town without nature,
not one living tree.</i>

11
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,130
<i>So, what happened to them?</i>

12
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,449
<i>Cue the music! Let's see.</i>

13
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,365
<i>Buzz. Buzz.</i>

14
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:04,284
<i>In Thneedville,
it's a brand new dawn</i>

15
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,447
<i>With brand new cars
and houses and lawns</i>

16
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,410
<i>Here in
Got-all-that-we-need-ville</i>

17
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,931
<i>In Thneedville,
we manufacture our trees</i>

18
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,322
<i>Each one is made in factories</i>

19
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,131
<i>And uses 96 batteries</i>

20
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,050
<i>In Thneedville,
the air's not so clean</i>

21
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,164
<i>So we buy it fresh</i>

22
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,368
<i>It comes out this machine!</i>

23
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,131
<i>In Satisfaction's-
guaranteed-ville</i>

24
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:46,401
<i>In Thneedville,
we don't want to know</i>

25
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,241
<i>Where the smog and trash
and chemicals go</i>

26
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,405
<i>I just went swimming,
and now I glow</i>

27
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,927
<i>In Thneedville,
we have fun year round</i>

28
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,289
<i>We surf and snowboard
right in town</i>

29
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,967
<i>We thank the Lord
for all we've got</i>

30
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,647
<i>Including this
brand new parking lot!</i>

31
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,564
<i>Parking lot!</i>

32
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,645
<i>Parking lot!</i>

33
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,288
<i>Oh, look, it's Aloysius O'Hare</i>

34
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,683
<i>Aloysius O'Hare</i>

35
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,970
<i>The man who found
a way to sell air</i>

36
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,368
<i>And became a zillionaire</i>

37
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,368
Hip-hip-hooray!

38
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,569
<i>In Thneedville,
we love living this way</i>

39
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,328
<i>It's like living in paradise</i>

40
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,210
<i>It's perfect!
And that's how it will stay</i>

41
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,327
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

42
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,880
<i>Here in
Love-the-life-we-lead-ville</i>

43
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,644
<i>Destined-to-succeed-ville</i>

44
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,722
<i>We-are-all-agreed-ville</i>

45
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,770
<i>We love it here in...</i>

46
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,244
<i>Thneedville!</i>

47
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,520
Yes!

48
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,847
Oh, hi, Ted.

49
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,168
Oh, hey, Audrey. Hi.

50
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,011
Did your ball land
in my backyard again?

51
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,531
What? No.

52
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,489
A model airplane, this time.

53
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,767
Hey, do you want to
see something cool?

54
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,046
Come on.

55
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,684
Whoa!

56
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,650
Did you...

57
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,729
Did you paint this?

58
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,649
Do you like it?
What?

59
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,407
Are you kidding?
This is amazing!

60
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,687
What are those?

61
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,764
Those are trees.
Real ones.

62
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,010
They used to grow
all around here.

63
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,645
And people said that
the touch of their tufts

64
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,166
was softer than
anything, even silk.

65
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,880
And they smelled
like butterfly milk!

66
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,088
Wow! What does
that even mean?

67
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,521
I know, right?

68
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,847
Oh, yeah.

69
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,288
What I want more than anything
in the whole world is to see

70
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,722
a real living tree

71
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,526
growing in my backyard.

72
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,531
So if, say... I'm just
thinking out loud here.

73
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,251
If a guy somehow got you one...

74
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,522
I'd probably
marry him on the spot.

75
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,247
I bet that sounds crazy.
Does that sound crazy?

76
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,244
No! Not crazy.

77
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,569
Not crazy at all.

78
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,046
Ted, honey,
don't play with your food.

79
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,440
You, either, Mom.

80
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:39,690
So, Mom, do you happen to
know if there's any place

81
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,161
where I could get a real tree?

82
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,971
Ted, we already have a tree.
It's the latest model.

83
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,328
Yeah, but I mean a real one

84
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,370
that grows out of
the ground or whatever.

85
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,885
You know, a real tree.

86
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,041
Really?

87
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,851
You would rather
have some dirty, messy

88
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,321
lump of wood that just
sticks out of the ground?

89
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,731
And it does what? I don't
even know what it does.

90
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,881
What's its purpose?

91
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,200
Look at what we've got.

92
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,443
It's the Oak-amatic. The only
tree with its own remote.

93
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,451
Summer, autumn, winter,

94
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,681
and disco!

95
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,890
Mom? Come on, Ted. Get into it.

96
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,007
Dance with the tree.

97
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,048
Oh, it hurts, Mom. Please stop.

98
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,483
So' anyway...

99
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,364
Let's just say I need a tree.

100
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,965
Where would I go?
What do I do?

101
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,050
Then you know what? You
need to find the Once-ler.

102
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,041
The what?

103
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:35,160
Mom, it's not really the time for
one of your magical fables, okay?

104
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,442
That's right, I forgot.

105
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,962
I'm old and can't even
remember to put my teeth in.

106
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,929
Stand down.
That's not what I meant.

107
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,889
No, really, I forgot my teeth.

108
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,640
Would you be a dear
and go get them for me?

109
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,563
Sure, Mom.

110
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,041
Okay, here's the deal.

111
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,124
The Once-ler is the man who knows
what happened to the trees.

112
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,441
You want one,
you need to find him.

113
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,091
The Once-ler?
Mmm-hmm.

114
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,481
Okay. Grammy,
is this a real thing

115
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,891
that we're talking about now?

116
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,604
Oh, he's real all right.

117
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,604
Well, where can I find him?

118
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:19,091
Far outside of town
where the grass never grows

119
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,762
and the wind smells slow
and sour when it blows.

120
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,050
And no birds ever sing,
excepting old crows.

121
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,166
Quit doing that.

122
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,601
That's the place
where the Once-ler lives.

123
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,921
Wait, outside of town?

124
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,282
People used to say
if you brought him 15 cents,

125
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,441
<i>a nail</i>

126
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,446
<i>and the shell of a great,
great, great grandfather snail,</i>

127
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,051
<i>he would tell you everything.</i>

128
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,841
Hmm.

129
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,402
Mr. O'Hare,
what we've got for you

130
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,687
is something that is
going to take O'Hare Air

131
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,444
to the next level.

132
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,449
Now, Mr. O'Hare,
I know what you're thinking.

133
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,568
One, "I've gotten rich
selling people air that's"

134
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,642
"fresher than
the stinky stuff outside"

135
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,290
Two, and here is
the important one,

136
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,681
"How can I possibly make
even more money?"

137
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,609
We can tell you, sir!
We can tell you.

138
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,331
Check out this commercial, huh?

139
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,081
Well, here goes
another lame Saturday.

140
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,484
Dude, I don't think so!

141
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,967
Huh!

142
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,081
Hey!

143
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,561
Man!

144
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,687
Oh, yeah!

145
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,681
What!

146
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,361
Yeah!

147
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,685
<i>O'Hare purified air.
Freshness to go.</i>

148
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,046
<i>Please breathe responsibly.</i>

149
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,201
Ah?

150
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,964
Oh, my goodness. Yeah!
Love it.

151
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,369
You got to be kidding me.

152
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,284
You really think people are
stupid enough to buy this?

153
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,882
Our research shows that if you put
something in a plastic bottle,

154
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,086
people will buy it.

155
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,241
Exactly. And...

156
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,243
And what's more, when
we build a new factory

157
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,845
to make the plastic bottles,

158
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,327
the air quality is
just going to get worse.

159
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,443
Which will make people
want our air even more,

160
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,409
and drive sales where?

161
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,521
Through the roof!

162
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:12,044
So, in other words,
the more smog in the sky

163
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,251
the more people will buy.

164
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,648
See, that's why he's the genius!
It even rhymes!

165
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,363
I'm aware it rhymes.

166
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,321
Coats. Big.

167
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,845
What do you two
knuckleheads want?

168
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,331
I'm in the middle of a meeting!

169
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,247
What?

170
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,931
Why is he leaving town?

171
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,883
No one ever leaves town!

172
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,924
See what he's up to.

173
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,046
Whoa!

174
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,921
Huh?

175
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,966
Whoa! Whoa.

176
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,406
Oh, man.

177
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,400
Whoa!

178
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,125
All right.

179
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,247
Okay.

180
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,122
What the...

181
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,645
Whoa!

182
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,087
Who are you?

183
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,482
Who are you and what
are you doing here?

184
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,961
I'm Ted. I'm Ted.

185
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,680
I can't breathe.
Are you the Once-ler?

186
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,968
Oh, man.
Didn't you read the signs?

187
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,288
No one is
supposed to come here.

188
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,483
Get out of here
and leave me alone!

189
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,483
And don't let the boot
hit you on the way out.

190
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,607
The boot?

191
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,361
Hello!

192
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,487
Ow!

193
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,564
Listen! People say that if
someone brings you this stuff

194
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,649
that you will tell
them about trees.

195
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,047
No, no, no!

196
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,681
Trees?

197
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,166
Yeah, real ones.

198
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,886
You know,
that grow out of the ground?

199
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,401
Hello?

200
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,891
Sorry, it's just...

201
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,407
Well, I didn't think anyone
still cared about trees.

202
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,848
Well, that's me. The guy
who still cares. I'm here.

203
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,128
Hey! What?

204
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,571
Do you want to
know about trees?

205
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,881
About what happened to them?

206
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,806
Why they're all gone?
It's because of me.

207
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,881
Wait, what?

208
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,608
It's because of me!

209
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,082
And my invention, the Thneed.

210
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:54,445
It was an amazing product that
could do the job of a thousand.

211
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,761
All right.

212
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,884
Sounds ridiculous,
but I mean, that's cool.

213
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,009
You're darn right it was cool!

214
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,885
It all started a long time ago.

215
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,050
Can we start not
so long ago, maybe?

216
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,287
Do you want a tree?

217
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,760
Yes, yes.

218
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,246
Then it all started
a long, long time ago.

219
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,766
<i>I was a young man leaving home.</i>

220
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:22,322
Well, here I go, Mom. Off to
change the world with my Thneed.

221
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,765
I'm actually doing it!

222
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,411
Yes, but just remember, Oncie,

223
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,211
if somehow your invention
ends up a failure

224
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,362
instead of a success,

225
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,807
oh, it wouldn't
surprise me at all!

226
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,766
Nice wheels.

227
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,287
Burn!

228
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,364
Ow!

229
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,566
Yeah, "Burn!"

230
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,803
But you will see, okay? I'm
going to prove you all wrong.

231
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,285
Come on, Melvin!

232
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,126
<i>So, there I was
at the very bottom.</i>

233
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,407
<i>With nothing
but a wagon, a mule,</i>

234
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,605
<i>and a completely irrational
sense of optimism.</i>

235
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,451
<i>I was searching the globe,</i>

236
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,889
<i>obsessed with finding the
perfect material for my Thneed.</i>

237
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,130
<i>But I'd had
absolutely no success.</i>

238
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:16,968
<i>Until one day, I found paradise.</i>

239
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,121
Oh!

240
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,487
We're going to be
there soon, I'm sure.

241
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,727
Whoa!

242
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:34,968
This is the most
beautiful place,

243
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,963
okay, I have ever seen.

244
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,761
Oh.

245
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,330
Ta-da!

246
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,967
Whoa!

247
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,963
<i>Yeah</i>

248
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,929
<i>This is it</i>

249
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,090
<i>This is the place</i>

250
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,884
<i>These Truff ula trees
are just what I need</i>

251
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:32,841
<i>Gonna chop one down
and make my Thneed</i>

252
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,604
<i>But first...</i>

253
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,927
Now you!

254
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,686
That's great!

255
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,080
<i>So now our friendship can begin</i>

256
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,367
<i>Hand in hand, and wing and fin</i>

257
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,011
<i>There's nothing
you and I can't do</i>

258
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,924
<i>So let's all make
my dreams come true</i>

259
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,886
Hey, guys!

260
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,011
Come on, where is
my back-up chorus?

261
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,401
What?

262
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,689
Ah-ha! Oh.

263
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,691
Ooh!

264
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,129
<i>Hey, hey, wait.
Wait a minute.</i>

265
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,361
Excuse me?

266
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,928
Yeah, that's awesome.

267
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,970
Feeding junk food to forest animals?
That's great.

268
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,169
But, uh, is there
a musical number

269
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,651
where you show me
how to get a tree?

270
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,001
Because I would
love to hear that one.

271
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,925
Oh, yes. Right after the
musical number about the kid

272
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,764
who kept
interrupting the story,

273
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,604
and was never heard from again.

274
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,208
Right, got it. Proceed.

275
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,444
All right, here we go.

276
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,809
About to make a Thneed,
about to change the world.

277
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,160
Check it out, guys...

278
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,607
Where did everybody go?

279
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,169
Little did I know that by
chopping down that tree

280
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,962
I had just summoned a mystical
creature as old as time itself.

281
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:37,241
The legendary,
slightly annoying

282
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,448
guardian of the forest.

283
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,725
The Lorax.

284
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,481
Hey!
Whoo!

285
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,206
Did you chop down this tree?

286
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,563
Uh... No.

287
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,841
Who did it?

288
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,724
What's that?

289
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,606
I think he did it.

290
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,365
Leave!
Vacate the premises!

291
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,488
Take your ax and get out!

292
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,802
And who are you?

293
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,922
I'm the Lorax!
Guardian of the forest.

294
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,969
I speak for the trees.

295
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,887
So you're telling me,
you just didn't see me

296
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,769
magically appear
out of that stump?

297
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,763
With all the lightning
and thunder and stuff.

298
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,921
You didn't see any of that?

299
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,765
No, but that sounds amazing.
Can I see some of that?

300
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,720
Uh, yeah, I could show you.
But that's not how it works.

301
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,121
Okay. Um...

302
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,721
Didn't really happen.

303
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,360
Oh, I know what you want!

304
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:29,561
I've got one of these for the
cutest little guy lever saw!

305
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,246
Yummy, yummy,
yummy, yummy, yummy...

306
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,285
How dare you!
Give me that!

307
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,170
Mmm.

308
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,285
I'm going to eat this,

309
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,488
but I am highly offended by it.

310
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:50,321
What are you... Hey, Mustache!
Will you stop that?

311
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,410
What's your deal, man?

312
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,727
Pull them right out Time
for you to go, Beanpole!

313
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,968
Just going to put them right back in.
We can do this all day.

314
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,251
Stop right there! Stop it!

315
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:11,481
So you would hammer one of
nature's innocent creatures?

316
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,126
What? No!

317
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,011
I would never hit this little guy.
You, on the other hand,

318
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,441
I would gladly pound you

319
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,249
and your mustache
into the ground!

320
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,008
Behold! The intruder
and his violent ways.

321
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,050
Shame on you.
For shame!

322
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,089
All right, you know what?
That's it!

323
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,003
You listen to me,
you furry meatloaf.

324
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,526
I'm going to chop down as
many trees as I need. Okay?

325
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,841
Newsflash!
Not going anywhere!

326
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,844
End of story.

327
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,051
Then you leave me no choice.

328
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:50,045
If you're not gone by the time
the sun sets on this valley,

329
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:54,205
all the forces of nature
will be unleashed upon you

330
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,644
and curse you until
the end of your days!

331
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,486
You have been warned.

332
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,490
Thanks.
Yeah, okay.

333
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,847
You have been warned.

334
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,001
But I didn't listen
to his warning.

335
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,322
And you won't believe
what happened that night.

336
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,401
What?

337
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,562
If you want to hear more,
come back tomorrow.

338
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,043
Hey, wait, wait! Tomorrow?

339
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,360
Whoa!

340
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,090
Whoa-ho-ho.

341
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,241
Are you serious right now?

342
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,846
Ah! You live in
the middle of nowhere!

343
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,407
It stinks out here.
Don't make me come back!

344
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,007
I guess you don't really want
to hear the rest of the story.

345
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,647
No, no.

346
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,571
I do. I really do. I want to
hear the story. I just...

347
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,530
Nah! You don't have
what it takes. Goodbye.

348
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,127
Wait, wait!
I have what it takes.

349
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,728
It's all right. It's
okay, I'll come back.

350
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,926
It's no problem.

351
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,766
See, here I am, leaving.
Walking away now.

352
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,326
I'll see you tomorrow.

353
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,087
Mmm.

354
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,923
Maybe. Just maybe.

355
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,411
What did you wish for, Audrey?

356
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,801
Well, I would love to tell you,

357
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,680
but, sadly, according to the
universal wish laws, I cannot.

358
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,004
I know what she wished for.

359
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,330
Was it, perhaps...

360
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,205
This?

361
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,443
Ted, you didn't.

362
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,603
Oh, no. I totally did.

363
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,525
Happy birthday, Audrey.

364
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,324
Kiss him! Kiss him!

365
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,041
Ted.

366
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,446
Ted. Tedster.
Huh!

367
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,649
You're kissing the
cereal again, hon. What?

368
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,531
I just...
I like this cereal.

369
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,761
What one is this?
Yeah!

370
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,445
Okay.

371
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,126
Well, I'll make sure to buy
extra next time for you.

372
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,931
All right, cool. Hey, I got to run.
I got to go do athing.

373
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,604
So, I'll see you guys.

374
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,683
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

375
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,489
You're not going
anywhere, young man.

376
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,847
It's Sunday. You
know what that means?

377
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,810
Family time, and we're
all playing board games!

378
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,961
But...

379
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,967
Hmm.

380
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,371
Mmm?

381
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,126
Oh, man.

382
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,010
Mom, seriously every turn?

383
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,684
Hey, back off!

384
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,326
Ooh!

385
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,483
No.
Okay! Family time is over.

386
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,683
It is now personal time.
I'll be in my room.

387
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,361
Okay, dear. Have fun.

388
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,128
I knew I could break her.

389
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,367
Go.
Huh?

390
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,566
Go see him!

391
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,926
Oh, yeah!

392
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,206
You rule!
Thank you, Grammy.

393
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,887
Whoa!

394
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,723
Hey! Ted, right?

395
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,167
Um, Mr. O'Hare?

396
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,403
So, I hear you have
become interested in trees.

397
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,164
What's that all about?

398
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,767
Oh. Um...

399
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,051
Where did you hear that?

400
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,167
Oh.

401
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,924
Teddy, there's not much
that goes on in Thneedville

402
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,729
that I don't know about.

403
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:02,486
Here's the deal, I make a living
selling fresh air to people.

404
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,086
Trees?
They make it for free.

405
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,891
So, when I hear
people talking about them,

406
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,328
I consider it kind of
a threat to my business.

407
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,088
I don't even know
what you're talking about.

408
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,123
You listen to me, boy.

409
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,642
Don't go poking around in
things you don't understand

410
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,802
or I'll be your
worst nightmare.

411
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,691
I'm Frankenstein's head
on a spider's body!

412
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,840
Yeah, um...

413
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,843
Okay, my mom is expecting me.
So, I'm just going to...

414
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,565
Of course, of course. Now, go
back to your family game time.

415
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,322
Grandma just finished her turn.

416
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,281
How did you know?

417
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,003
Please. I have
eyes everywhere.

418
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,961
Huh!

419
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,407
You got a beautiful
town here, Ted.

420
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,848
Lots of fun stuff to occupy
your short attention span.

421
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,003
Why, I can't
think of any reason

422
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:00,688
you would ever want to
go outside of town again.

423
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,807
Ever.

424
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:11,290
Okay! Good talk.
Really good talk.

425
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,601
Oh, no.

426
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,561
Look out!

427
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:45,122
Hey, man? You know, you need
to change that door bell.

428
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,842
Oh, you missed me.
What?

429
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:52,131
You're already back. Clearly,
you missed me a little. Right?

430
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:56,007
No, I didn't. I'm just here
to hear the end of the story.

431
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,730
Why are you so interested
in trees anyway?

432
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,211
Why aren't you like other kids,

433
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,521
break dancing and
wearing bell-bottoms,

434
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,682
and playing the Donkey Kongs?

435
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,367
Yeah, right, right.
I don't know.

436
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,925
Uh, I just thought it would be kind
of cool to have one, you know?

437
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,246
Huh?

438
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,810
It's a girl, isn't it?

439
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,724
What? No!

440
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,611
Really? Because when a guy
does something stupid once,

441
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,250
well, that's because
he's a guy.

442
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,766
But if he does
the same stupid thing twice,

443
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,491
it's usually to
impress some girl.

444
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,410
Hey, she is not some girl!

445
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,404
She's a woman, in high school.

446
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:34,530
And she loves trees.
And I'm going to get her one.

447
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,881
Aw!

448
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:39,806
How nice to see someone so
undeterred by things like reality.

449
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,967
Thank you.

450
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,883
All right,
but where did we leave off?

451
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,767
Now that's a Thneed.

452
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,571
Nothing unmanly
about knitting. No, sir.

453
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,967
Look at that...

454
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,241
Oh!

455
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,243
Who taught you guys
how to steal a bed?

456
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,526
Shh!

457
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,482
Okay, nice and easy.

458
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,249
Nice work, you guys. Couldn't
have done it without you.

459
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:17,849
You got to be kidding me.
Can he swim?

460
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,726
Of course he can't swim!

461
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,571
Hang on, Pipsqueak!
I'm coming to get you!

462
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,448
Hey, you fishies!
Stop that bed!

463
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,490
Whoo! Whoo!

464
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,731
Jump, jump!

465
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,044
Come on, get up there.
Come on.

466
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,966
Go, go! A little bit more!
A little bit more!

467
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,006
Now what?

468
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:53,801
Mmm-mmm.

469
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,325
Get up there.

470
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,410
Okay, Pipsqueak,
give me your hand.

471
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,481
Come on,
reach out for the Lorax.

472
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,366
Where did you go?

473
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,726
Bar-ba-loots.

474
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,121
Oh, that's bad.

475
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,925
Hey, Beanpole, wake up!

476
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,889
What's happening?
Where am I?

477
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,248
Hey! We got trouble,
and it's coming up fast!

478
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,801
Whoo!

479
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,325
We're in a river!

480
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,001
Whew!

481
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,206
Oh, no.

482
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,691
Just do something!

483
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,285
Help is on the way!

484
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,770
No, no!

485
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,526
Just a minute!

486
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,167
Oh, no!

487
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,000
Wake up! Wake up!

488
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,048
Yuck!

489
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,041
Clear!

490
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,281
Ah!

491
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,690
I was heading into the light,

492
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,603
and you pulled me
right back and here I am!

493
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,166
You saved my life!

494
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,050
Yeah, I know. Well, no,
it's not that big a deal.

495
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,246
It is a big deal!

496
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:16,331
Look, I almost went over
that waterfall! Wait...

497
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,651
On my bed. How did my
bed get in the river?

498
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,331
Uh... About that...

499
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,806
Actually... I put your
bed in the water.

500
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,925
I didn't mean you any harm.

501
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,401
I just wanted to
calmly float you away.

502
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,727
Look, everyone here
needs the trees

503
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,848
and you're chopping them down!

504
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,763
So, we've got a big problem.

505
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,687
All right, look.

506
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:52,004
I hereby swear that I will
never chop down another tree.

507
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,530
I promise.

508
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,123
Thank you. But I'm going
to keep my eye on you.

509
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,528
Good. Now, I've got
a big day tomorrow

510
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,364
so I'm going to get some sleep.

511
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,368
Right after I find my bed.

512
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,361
Ow!

513
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,522
Okay, what are you...

514
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,128
Question, what are
they doing here?

515
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:38,770
And follow up, if I may,
what are you doing here?

516
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,728
Well, after
the incident last night,

517
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,446
we found one of your socks
and came here to return it.

518
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,081
But when we got here,
you were asleep. What?

519
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,566
Ew!

520
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,007
Exactly. And sleeping
is the body's way

521
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,321
of telling
other people to go away.

522
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:56,290
I know, but you looked so cozy.

523
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:00,126
And it was cold outside, and we
just fell asleep. No harm done.

524
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,443
"No harm done"?
"No harm done"? Okay.

525
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:08,081
Okay, I put my lips on those.
Well, I used to, anyway.

526
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,481
Ew.

527
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,801
Did you just...
In my bowl!

528
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,531
Why do you have one of these?

529
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,841
You don't even have a mustache.

530
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,925
Okay, that's it!

531
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,923
What? I thought
we made a deal last night.

532
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,241
Yes, we did.

533
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,607
And I said I wouldn't
chop down any more trees.

534
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,648
And I said I was going
to keep an eye on you.

535
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,723
I'm starving.
What's for breakfast?

536
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,685
Breakfast is overrated.

537
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,651
You know what?
I got work to do. Yeah.

538
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,884
I got to go into town
and sell my Thneed.

539
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,650
You chopped down
one of my trees

540
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,404
to make that piece of garbage?

541
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,607
Look at that...

542
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:57,130
"Garbage"? Oh, no.
Oh, no! You do not get it.

543
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,647
This is a revolutionary product

544
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,007
that will change
the world as we know it.

545
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,971
It has a million uses!

546
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,610
Look at this.
It's a swimsuit!

547
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,167
Mud tracked all over your
floor by uninvited guests?

548
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,164
Well, the Thneed sure
comes in handy for that!

549
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,560
But wait, there's more!

550
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,245
Thanks to its
all-natural microfibers,

551
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,687
the Thneed is
super-absorbent!

552
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,285
It also works as a hat.

553
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,245
Of course, you probably
want to wring it out first.

554
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,442
Go ahead, knock yourself out.

555
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,044
But nobody is going
to buy that thing.

556
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,610
Good to know.

557
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:34,969
Well, fortunately, you are not
the target market, weirdo.

558
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,485
You're bringing a guitar?

559
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,364
Oh, yeah.
I got a little jingle.

560
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,966
I'm gonna blow some minds,
gonna sell some Thneeds!

561
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,087
Yeah.

562
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,562
<i>Everybody needs a Thneed</i>

563
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:50,120
<i>A fine thing that all people...</i>

564
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,044
Sit down, go on.

565
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,881
Unfortunately, I didn't
sell it the first day.

566
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,843
<i>The Thneed is good</i>

567
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,923
<i>The Thneed is great...</i>

568
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,081
Hey!

569
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,766
Or the second day.

570
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,127
Hey!

571
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,771
<i>Or the third,
or fourth, or fifth day.</i>

572
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,885
Okay, that one
hit the tender spot.

573
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,041
<i>Until finally...</i>

574
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,610
That's it!
You know what?

575
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,047
I'm done with this thing.

576
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,811
Aw.

577
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,169
My family was right.
I quit!

578
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,204
Hey. Cool hat.

579
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,721
Oh, my gosh!
I totally want one.

580
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,121
That thing makes me
like you more.

581
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,047
Hey! Where's your Thneed,
did you sell it?

582
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,005
Hey. No, no.
Didn't sell it.

583
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,766
Turns out, it's ahead
of its time, I guess.

584
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:59,128
Hey, you gave it your best shot.
Right? What more can you do?

585
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,123
Come on, take a seat,
we'll deal you in.

586
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,807
What are we playing?

587
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,487
I'm playing poker. He's playing Go Fish.
And I think he's hungry.

588
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,041
Oh.

589
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,045
<i>Pancake, the pancake</i>

590
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,921
Up!

00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,927
Who is up for ninths?

592
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,761
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

593
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,006
Whoa!

594
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,570
All right, pass them over.

595
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,086
Yeah, see?

596
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,084
What's going on?

597
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:43,560
Oh, no.
That's a lot of people.

00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,883

<i>It's a tightrope for an acrobat</i>

604
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:17,122
<i>A net for catching butterflies</i>

605
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:22,008

<i>We need a Thneed</i>

611
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:42,525
Mom? Hey, it's me! I told you
I was going to be a success!

612
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,326
You need to bring the whole
family here right now.

613
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,448
We're going to be rich!

614
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:52,364
What? I'm going to need all the
help I can get. Don't worry.

615
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,051
So, has he told you
how to get a tree yet?

616
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,765
Actually, no.

617
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:01,208
But I think he's going to get
to that part really soon.

618
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,123
Here we are.
What?

619
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,041
I'll just be a minute.

620
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,762
Oh, wow. Hey, Audrey!

621
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,323
Oh, hi, Ted! What's up?

622
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:16,570
You know me, just cruising.
Putting out the vibe.

623
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,483
Just me and my thoughts.

624
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,967
Oh, is this the girl
you're always talking about?

625
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,451
Grandma!
Stop making things up.

626
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,091
She's even prettier than...
Okay, got to run! Bye.

627
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:31,131
Okay, Grammy,
let's get you home!

628
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,321
Yeah!

629
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,367
Whoa!

630
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,363
I'm so sorry. So sorry.

631
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,687
Did not wanna see that.

632
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:10,921
Whoa!

633
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:15,886
Whoa!

634
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,846
Whoa-ho-ho!

635
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,286
Hey!

636
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,561
Hey, I'm back.

637
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:35,926
What have you got there?

638
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,327
Yes!

639
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:41,806
Whoa!

640
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:45,885
Thank you, Ted.

641
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,281
Now, picture this.

642
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:55,687
<i>Sun shining,
a blue sky, a perfect day.</i>

643
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:02,285
<i>It was all downhill from there.</i>

644
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,486
Whoa!

645
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,690
What a dump.

646
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,968
Hey, Aunt Grizelda!

647
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,728
Hey, Chet, check this out!

648
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:41,801
Go long!

649
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,289
No, Brett,
that's actually not a...

650
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:45,361
Okay.

651
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,044
Go long! Go long!

652
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,531
I got it! I got it!

653
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:52,161
Got it!

654
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,488
He totally ran into that tree!

655
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,247
Ow!

656
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,123
Oncie, is that you?

657
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,440
Mom!

658
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:06,048
There he is! There's my big,
suddenly successful son!

659
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,571
We always knew you would
make it, Oncie. Right?

660
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:13,561
Hey! I love this guy!

661
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,844
But you always said I wouldn't
amount to anything, remember?

662
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,805
Hush your mouth. I was just
trying to motivate you!

663
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,764
I am really glad
that you clarified that

664
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:24,730
because it actually hurt my
feelings for a really long time.

665
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:28,961
Anyway, you're all here, you all
work for me, and that's cool.

666
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,405
So, let's get to work.

667
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,963
Brett, Chet, set up the RV!

668
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,407
Would you stop
throwing that bear?

669
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,481
Time out. Back up. Stop. Don't move an inch.
Nobody's moving in here.

670
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:08,721
You got to go. Goodbye.

671
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:12,203
So, who invited
the giant, furry peanut?

672
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,446
You calling me a peanut, huh?

673
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:14,726
I'll go right up your nose!

674
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,245
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

675
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,367
You wouldn't hit a woman.

676
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:20,605
That's a woman?

677
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,281
Okay.
Everyone, cool it.

678
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:25,442
Let's not get off
on the wrong foot here.

679
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,569
Um, family, this is my friend...
Acquaintance.

680
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:32,281
Yeah, acquaintance. Very good
acquaintance, the Lorax.

681
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,886
He speaks for the trees.
That's right.

682
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,646
And on behalf
of the trees, get out!

683
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:43,329
Will you just be nice!
This is my family.

684
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,441
And I'm going to
need their help

685
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,761
if my company is
going to get bigger. Okay?

686
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,081
Bigger?

687
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:51,449
Yeah, this isn't some
rinky-dink operation any more.

688
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,682
I got plans. Big plans!

689
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:58,289
A vision of a world filled with Thneeds.
It's going to be huge!

690
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,645
Which way does a tree fall?

691
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,571
Uh, down?

692
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:06,487
A tree falls the way it leans.

693
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:09,646
Be careful which way you lean.

694
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:22,211
I mean, look at this.
It's amazing.

695
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,923
I am so proud of me.

696
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:28,643
Oncie, we've got us
a little problem.

697
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:30,127
Problem?

698
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,361
Mmm-hmm.

699
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:34,489
See, we're not making
Thneeds fast enough.

700
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,889
Harvesting the tufts
takes too long!

701
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:47,404
Well, what else can we do?

702
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:51,565
Well, and this just came to me,

703
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:54,690
we could always start
chopping down the trees.

704
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:56,406
What?

705
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,325
Now you're thinking.
That would speed things up!

706
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,045
But...
No "but" s, Oncie.

707
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:02,531
You're running a business now.

708
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,404
You have to do what's
best for the company,

709
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,970
and your momma.

710
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:11,531
Well, I guess it couldn't hurt
to chop down a few trees.

711
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:15,889
You've made me so proud, Oncie.
Come here!

712
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:18,646
Hey! I love this guy!

713
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,243
No! No, no, no!
Stop it! Please, stop.

714
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,411
Take that, you stupid tree!

715
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,408
Where do you
think you're going?

716
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,685
Excuse me, sir. I need
to talk with your boss.

717
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,923
Oh, I'm sorry,

718
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:51,243
but Mr. Once-ler's
not seeing anyone right now.

719
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:52,560
Yeah, well,
he'll see me. So...

720
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,085
Hey, keep your paws off me!

721
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,083
Give me a reason, Shorty.

722
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,810
Hey, you broke your promise.

723
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:59,211
You're better than this.

724
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:02,006
You gotta stop!
This is bad!

725
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:04,840
Have a nice day!

726
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:09,281
Bad?

727
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,649
I'm not bad, I'm the good guy here.
He just doesn't get it.

728
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:14,605
Do you think I'm bad?

729
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:16,160
Thank you!

730
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:19,050
I mean, something good
finally happens to me,

731
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:22,203
and he just has to come along
and rain on my parade.

732
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:23,771
What's his problem?

733
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:25,441
See?

734
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:30,602
Yeah, bad! Right.

735
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:44,291
<i>How bad can I be?</i>

736
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:46,362
<i>I'm just doin'
what comes naturally</i>

737
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:48,761
<i>How bad can I be?</i>

738
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:51,082
<i>I'm just following my destiny</i>

739
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:53,527
<i>How bad can I be?</i>

740
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,807
<i>I'm just doin'
what comes naturally</i>

741
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:58,121
<i>How bad can I be?</i>

742
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,168
<i>How bad can I possibly be?</i>

743
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,606
<i>Well, there's
a principle in nature</i>

744
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:02,886
<i>Principle in nature</i>

745
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,928
<i>That almost
every creature knows</i>

746
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,326
<i>Called survival of the fittest</i>

747
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,526
<i>Survival of the fittest</i>

748
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:10,080
<i>And check it,
this is how it goes</i>

749
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,288
<i>The animal that wins
gotta scratch and fight</i>

750
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:14,408
<i>And claw and bite and punch</i>

751
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,961
<i>And the animal that doesn't
Well, the animal that doesn't</i>

752
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:21,602
<i>Winds up someone else's
La-la-la-la lunch</i>

753
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:23,962
<i>Munch, munch, munch, munch,
munch I'm just sayin'</i>

754
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,520
<i>How bad can I be?</i>

755
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,728
<i>I'm just doin'
what comes naturally</i>

756
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,121
<i>How bad can I be?</i>

757
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:33,362
<i>I'm just following my destiny</i>

758
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:36,011
<i>How bad can I be?</i>

759
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:38,128
<i>I'm just doin'
what comes naturally</i>

760
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,441
<i>How bad can I be?</i>

761
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,688
<i>How bad can I possibly be?</i>

762
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:44,171
<i>There's a principle in business</i>

763
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:45,241
<i>Principle in business</i>

764
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:47,209
<i>That everybody knows is sound</i>

765
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,886
<i>It says the people with the
money People with the money</i>

766
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:52,088
<i>Make this
ever-loving world go round</i>

767
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,601
<i>So I'm biggering my company
I'm biggering my factory</i>

768
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:55,841
<i>I'm biggering my corporate sign</i>

769
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:56,967
<i>Bigger, bigger!</i>

770
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,441
<i>Everybody out there
You take care of yours</i>

771
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:04,165
<i>I'll take care of
mine-mine-mine-mine-mine</i>

772
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:05,480
<i>Shake that bottom line</i>

773
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,489
<i>Let me hear you
say Smogulous Smoke!</i>

774
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:08,686
<i>Smogulous Smoke!</i>

775
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:09,881
<i>Schloppity-Schlopp!</i>

776
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:10,961
<i>Schloppity-Schlopp!</i>

777
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:14,169
<i>Complain all you want It's never,
ever, ever, ever gonna stop</i>

778
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:15,611
<i>Stop!</i>

779
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:18,081
<i>Come on,
how bad can I possibly be?</i>

780
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,481
<i>How bad can I be?</i>

781
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:22,762
<i>I'm just building the economy</i>

782
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:25,366
<i>How bad can I be?</i>

783
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,442
<i>Just look at me
petting this puppy</i>

784
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,807
<i>How bad can I be?</i>

785
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:32,201
<i>A portion of proceeds
goes to charity</i>

786
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:34,487
<i>How bad can I be?</i>

787
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:37,404
<i>How bad could I possibly be?
Let's see!</i>

788
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:41,720
<i>All the customers are buying</i>

789
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:46,611
<i>And the money's multiplying</i>

790
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,961
<i>And the PR people are lying</i>

791
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:56,051
<i>And the lawyers are denying</i>

792
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:00,441
<i>Who cares if
a few trees are dying?</i>

793
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,962
<i>This is all so gratifying!</i>

794
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:07,327
<i>How bad?</i>

795
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:12,520
<i>How bad can this possibly be?</i>

796
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:53,366
So, how are things?

797
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:55,889
What are you doing here?

798
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:59,721
Happy yet? You fill that
hole deep down inside you?

799
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:01,763
Or do you still need more?

800
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,446
Look, if you've got a problem
with what I'm doing,

801
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:09,203
why haven't you used your
quote-unquote powers to stop me?

802
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,571
I told you,
that's not how it works.

803
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,570
Right, I forgot.
You're a fraud.

804
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:19,371
I need you
to get out. Now!

805
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:22,288
Why? Do I make
you uncomfortable?

806
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,169
Remind you of
the promises you made?

807
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:26,130
The man you used to be?

808
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,201
You know what?

809
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:30,602
You can just shut your mustache.
My conscience is clear.

810
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:32,365
I have done nothing illegal.

811
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:34,920
I have my rights, and I
intend to keep on biggering

812
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:38,044
and biggering, and turning more
Truff ula trees into Thneeds.

813
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:42,164
And nothing is
going to stop me!

814
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:59,644
Well, that's it.

815
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:01,768
The very last one.

816
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:05,161
That may stop you.

817
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:27,091
Somebody sure made
a bundle on that thing.

818
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:30,448
I wonder what the next million
dollar invention's going to be.

819
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:39,004
Yeah, I wonder...

820
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:52,807
Son, you have let me down.

821
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,725
Brett, you are now
my favorite child.

822
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:16,082
Hey, look,
I don't want any trouble.

823
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:20,086
And you won't get any.
Not from them.

824
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:23,845
Thanks to you and your hacking,
and smogging and glupping,

825
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,843
they can't live here any more.

826
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,290
So, I'm sending them off.

827
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:36,851
Hopefully,
they'll be able to find

828
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:38,763
a better place
out there somewhere.

829
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:43,567
Melvin?

830
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:46,930
Melvin...

831
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:49,206
Hey, Pipsqueak...

832
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:54,401
Hey...

833
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:05,960
So, this is
really all your fault.

834
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,883
You destroyed everything.

835
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:09,886
Yes.

836
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:12,242
And each day
since the Lorax left,

837
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:15,369
I've sat here regretting
everything I've done,

838
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:19,684
staring at that word, "unless,"

839
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:23,284
and wondering what it meant.

840
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,124
But now I'm thinking...

841
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,567
Well, maybe you're the reason

842
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,847
the Lorax left that word there.

843
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:32,049
Me? Why would he
leave that for me?

844
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:35,562
Because unless someone like
you cares a whole awful lot,

845
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:37,763
nothing is going to get better.

846
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:40,124
It's not.

847
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:59,768
The last Truff ula seed.

848
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:03,122
You need to plant it, Ted.

849
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:06,483
Yeah, but, nobody cares
about trees any more.

850
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:07,920
Then make them care.

851
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:11,329
Plant the seed in the middle of
town, where everyone can see.

852
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:13,848
Change the way things are.

853
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:16,447
I know it may seem
small and insignificant,

854
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,727
but it's not about what it is,

855
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,968
it's about what it can become.

856
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:22,446
That's not just a seed,

857
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:25,481
any more than
you're just a boy.

858
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,606
I won't let you down.

859
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:37,805
I know.

860
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:19,761
Hey, Audrey!

861
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:21,326
Audrey!

862
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:23,281
Ted?

863
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:25,442
What are you doing?
Meet me at my house.

864
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:26,726
Wait, but...

865
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:28,325
My house, okay?

866
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:31,724
Got to plant the seed.

867
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:34,246
Okay, we're going
to need water.

868
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:36,285
And uh, something to dig with.

869
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:38,244
Um, what do I have...
Ted?

870
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:40,443
Mom, I'm busy, Mom.

871
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:42,285
Theodore Wiggins,
get down here right now,

872
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:44,283
and I am not kidding with you!

873
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:52,648
Ted, I would like
you to meet Mr. O'Hare,

874
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:55,087
the most powerful man in town.

875
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:57,885
There he is!

876
01:01:58,120 --> 01:01:59,326
Hello, Ted.

877
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:01,169
Uh...

878
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:03,891
Hi. Isn't he clever, Mr. O'Hare?

879
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:06,602
He knows his own
name and everything.

880
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:11,329
You know what I would love
right now, Mrs. Wiggins?

881
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,323
A delicious cookie.

882
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:16,081
Wonderful.

883
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:18,083
Teddy and I'll
stay here and talk.

884
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:20,766
Sure, why don't you go
ahead and adopt him?

885
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:24,722
I'm just kidding. That was a joke.
I was just joking.

886
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:27,171
I'll get your cookie.

887
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:30,444
I know you have it, Ted.

888
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:32,648
So, let's put an end
to this nonsense, shall we?

889
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:35,286
Hand it over.

890
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:36,561
I'm sorry...

891
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,769
I don't know what
you're talking about.

892
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:40,564
Really? Well, then...

893
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:43,087
I guess you wouldn't mind
us checking your room.

894
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,247
No, no, no!

895
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:46,004
Morty! McGurk!
Find the seed!

896
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:47,320
No, you can't go up there!

897
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:48,925
Guys, this is
ridiculous. Stop!

898
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:51,807
Hey!

899
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:53,725
No, you can't come in my room!

900
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:56,087
Find it!

901
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:03,046
Find it!

902
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:05,126
What is going on here?

903
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:08,762
This doesn't involve you!
Get back downstairs!

904
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:10,126
Excuse me, down there!

905
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:12,407
I don't care who you are,
you little crazy baby-man!

906
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:15,609
Get out of my house now.
This is outrageous.

907
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:18,047
Fine. Sorry.

908
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:21,204
Must have been a misunderstanding.
We'll be leaving now.

909
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:23,966
And my apologies, Ted.

910
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:27,806
You be safe.

911
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:31,771
Mind telling me
what's going on here?

912
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:33,524
The seed! Where is it?

913
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:34,681
Seed?

914
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,047
Where's Grammy?

915
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:40,961
It's alive!

916
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:46,490
I remember you.

917
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:49,084
Ted, what...

918
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:57,841
Audrey!

919
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:02,202
Hey, did you want to...
Well, okay!

920
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:05,083
Ted, what is this about?

921
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:07,209
It's about this.

922
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:08,961
Wait, wait, wait.

923
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:11,726
Is that... Yes. The
last Truff ula seed.

924
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:13,803
And you're going to help me plant
it right in the middle of town

925
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:15,609
where everyone can see it.

926
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,570
I could just
kiss you right now!

927
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:22,447
We don't have time for that.

928
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:24,529
I don't know,
we have a little time.

929
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,526
But, you know what, let's just go.
Let's go Forget about it.

930
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:56,810
Maniac!
Hey!

931
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:00,087
Ah!

932
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:03,161
Here it comes!

933
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:07,961
I'm going for it.

934
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:26,651
Oh, hello!

935
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:41,288
Ted, big scary blimp coming.

936
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:53,527
Whoa!

937
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:56,122
<i>You won't get away
with this, boy!</i>

938
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:57,647
Bam!

939
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:09,409
<i>Go faster, you idiot!</i>

940
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:11,447
Yeah!

941
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:13,564
Step on it, Ted!

942
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:15,286
Whoa!

943
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:25,884
You're fired!

944
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:29,006
Whoa! Ted, look out!

945
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:35,370
Nobody beats Aloysius O...
Ted...

946
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:47,771
This is not good.

947
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:49,729
How's it doing?

948
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:57,487
Whoa-ho-ho!

949
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:01,041
Loser!

950
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:03,043
Oh, really?

951
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:06,090
Oh, no. The seed!

952
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:10,411
Get that seed!

953
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:18,489
Hang on! Here we go!

954
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:22,487
Grammy!

955
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:32,840
Seriously, how cool
is your grandma?

956
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:41,007
No!

957
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:45,487
Come on!

958
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:47,281
Yeah, that's right.

959
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:48,807
There it is!

960
01:07:57,720 --> 01:08:00,849
Hey! Watch the road,
you meathead!

961
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:02,041
Ah!

962
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:08,841
Hey, ow, ow!

963
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:10,761
Oh, come on!

964
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:21,401
What the...

965
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:25,087
Get it unstuck, get it unstuck!

966
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:28,764
Bring it on, Teddy!

967
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:31,444
You don't have the guts!

968
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:33,167
Ted!

969
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:41,765
Grammy!

970
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,041
Whoo-hoo!
Yes!

971
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:51,767
Hey, hey, hey!

972
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:53,365
Hey! It's Mr. O...

973
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:57,130
Take that, shorty!

974
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,128
Okay, we have to get
this in the ground.

975
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:18,806
But where?
There's no dirt anywhere.

976
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:23,769
No, Grammy...

977
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:30,281
Hey, get out of there!

978
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,047
Ah!

979
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:36,727
Hey!

980
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,809
What?

981
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:43,566
See, what did
I tell you? Easy. Huh?

982
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,321
Hey, they broke O'Hare's head!

983
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:48,528
What do you think
you're doing, kid?

984
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:52,001
Um, I'm looking for
a place to plant a tree.

985
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:53,207
A real one.

986
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:54,645
Why would we need a tree?

987
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:56,688
Exactly.

988
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:00,805
Oh, man.

989
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:02,407
Folks...

990
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:06,567
The last thing you
want around here is trees.

991
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:08,245
They're filthy!

992
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:14,169
Spewing that sticky, nasty
sap all over the place.

993
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:19,000
They bring poisonous ants
and stinging bees.

994
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:20,650
Hey!
Ouch.

995
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:22,165
Think about the kids.

996
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:26,640
And, I just thought,
you know, they make leaves!

997
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:27,926
You know that, right?

998
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,843
Then these leaves,
they just fall.

999
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:31,684
They just fall
wherever they want!

1000
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:35,008
Come on! We know why you're
really against trees.

1001
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:37,282
Because they produce fresh air.

1002
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:38,566
For free!

1003
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:40,210
Oh!

1004
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:43,887
I am wounded!
You have lied!

1005
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,482
It is not a lie!
It's called photosynthesis.

1006
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:49,688
Come on.
She's making that up!

1007
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:52,491
That's a
made-up word, people!

1008
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:56,281
Thneedville is perfect
just the way it is.

1009
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:58,363
We don't need trees!

1010
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:00,803
That boy has a seed.

1011
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:03,686
We need to stop him!
Who's with me? Come on!

1012
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:05,040
O'Hare is right!

1013
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:07,328
Seeds will ruin us all!
Stop it!

1014
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:10,926
Last chance, kid.
Hand it over!

1015
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:12,640
Where do you think
you're going?

1016
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:14,211
Come on, let's go!

1017
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:16,328
Get in, get in!

1018
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:19,320
Hey!

1019
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:21,204
Stop that maniac!

1020
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:25,645
Excuse me, excuse me.
Watch out!

1021
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:32,291
Ted, you're going
to hit the wall!

1022
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:34,249
Yeah. I know.

1023
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:59,361
Wow. Did you see that?

1024
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:02,327
Who does this kid
think he is, huh?

1025
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:05,564
I am Ted Wiggins.

1026
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:08,402
And I speak for the trees.

1027
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:13,523
And the fact is, things aren't
perfect here in Thneedville.

1028
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,125
And they're only
going to get worse,

1029
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:17,441
unless we do
something about it,

1030
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,082
unless we change our ways.

1031
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:23,409
And we can start
by planting this!

1032
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:34,844
Okay. Come on, now.
Everything is fine.

1033
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:36,721
Right?

1034
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:40,441
I say we tell this kid
what we think about that seed!

1035
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:44,884
People, come on!

1036
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:50,528
You! Get out there right now

1037
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:54,366
and get these people on my
side, or else you're fired!

1038
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:58,091
Go on, tell them
what you think.

1039
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:05,442
<i>You don't know me,
but my name's Cy</i>

1040
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:10,210
<i>I'm just
the O'Hare delivery guy</i>

1041
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:14,410
<i>But it seems like
trees might be worth a try</i>

1042
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:17,928
<i>So I say let it grow</i>

1043
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:22,166
<i>My name is Dan</i>

1044
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:23,401
<i>And my name's Rose</i>

1045
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:26,086
<i>Our son Wesley kind of glows</i>

1046
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:29,005
<i>And that's not good,
so we suppose</i>

1047
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:30,764
<i>We should let it grow</i>

1048
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:33,207
<i>Let it grow, let it grow</i>

1049
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:36,090
<i>You can't reap
what you don't sow</i>

1050
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:38,402
<i>Plant a seed inside the Earth</i>

1051
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:40,842
<i>Just one way to know its worth</i>

1052
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:43,366
<i>Let's celebrate
the world's rebirth</i>

1053
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:45,204
<i>We say let it grow</i>

1054
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:47,601
<i>My name's Marie,
and I am three!</i>

1055
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:50,730
<i>I would really
like to see a tree</i>

1056
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:54,770
<i>I say let it grow</i>

1057
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:58,083
<i>I'm Grammy Norma I'm old,
and I've got gray hair</i>

1058
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:01,529
<i>But I remember when
trees were everywhere</i>

1059
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:04,080
<i>And no one had to pay for air</i>

1060
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:05,844
<i>So I say let it grow</i>

1061
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:08,161
<i>Let it grow, let it grow</i>

1062
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:11,364
<i>Like it did so long ago</i>

1063
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:13,602
<i>It is just one tiny seed</i>

1064
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:16,007
<i>But it's all we really need</i>

1065
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:18,651
<i>It's time to change
the life we lead</i>

1066
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:20,404
<i>Time to let it grow</i>

1067
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:23,689
<i>My name's O'Hare,
I'm one of you</i>

1068
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:28,482
<i>I live here in Thneedville, too</i>

1069
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:31,962
<i>The things you say
just might be true</i>

1070
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:35,283
<i>It could be time to start anew</i>

1071
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:40,241
<i>And maybe change
my point of view</i>

1072
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:43,645
Nah! I say let it die!

1073
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:45,723
<i>Let it die, let it die</i>

1074
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:47,564
<i>Let it shrivel up and...</i>

1075
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:49,324
Come on, who's with me?

1076
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:51,046
Nobody.

1077
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:53,325
<i>You greedy dirt-bag!</i>

1078
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:55,841
<i>Let it grow, let it grow</i>

1079
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:58,810
<i>Let the love inside you show</i>

1080
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:01,281
<i>Plant a seed inside the Earth</i>

1081
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:03,283
<i>Just one way to know its worth</i>

1082
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:05,931
<i>Let's celebrate
the world's rebirth</i>

1083
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:10,165
<i>We say let it grow</i>

1084
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:12,687
<i>Let it grow, let it grow</i>

1085
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:16,082
<i>You can't reap
what you don't sow</i>

1086
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:18,288
<i>It's just one tiny seed</i>

1087
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:20,641
<i>But it's all we really need</i>

1088
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:22,808
<i>It's time to
banish all your greed</i>

1089
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:25,611
<i>Imagine Thneedville
flowered and treed</i>

1090
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:30,521
<i>Let this be our solemn creed</i>

1091
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:33,168
Thank you, Ted.

1092
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:37,562
<i>We say let it grow</i>

1093
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:40,041
<i>In Thneedville</i>

1094
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:43,602
<i>We say let it grow</i>

1095
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:46,001
<i>It's a brand new dawn</i>

1096
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:49,448
<i>We say let it grow</i>

1097
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:51,204
<i>In Thneedville</i>

1098
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:54,887
<i>We say let it grow</i>

1099
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:59,761
<i>It's a brand new dawn</i>

1100
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:01,884
You done good, Beanpole.

1101
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,650
You done good.

1102
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:20,291
By the way, nice mustache.
