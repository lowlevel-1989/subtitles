You really think people are

Our research shows

people will buy it.
Exactly.

And what's more,

Through the roof!

165

So in other words,
the more smog in the sky--

175
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,922
Whoa.

176
00:13:11,394 --> 00:13:12,575
Huh?

177
00:13:12,675 --> 00:13:14,097
Whoa!

178
00:13:14,197 --> 00:13:16,940
Whoa! Whoa.

179
00:13:19,162 --> 00:13:21,164
Oh, man.

180
00:14:20,704 --> 00:14:22,086
Whoa.

181
00:14:22,186 --> 00:14:24,188
All right.

182
00:14:35,719 --> 00:14:37,721
Mm-mmm.

183
00:15:02,387 --> 00:15:04,369
Okay.

184
00:15:04,469 --> 00:15:06,571
What the--

185
00:15:06,671 --> 00:15:08,873
Whoa!

186
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,941
Who are you?

187
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,544
Who are you and what
are you doing here?

188
00:15:19,644 --> 00:15:22,507
I'm Ted! I'm Ted.

189
00:15:22,607 --> 00:15:25,070
I can't breathe.
Are you--
Are you the Once-ler?

190
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:27,432
Oh, man.
Didn't you read the signs?

191
00:15:27,532 --> 00:15:29,514
No one is supposed
to come here.

192
00:15:29,614 --> 00:15:31,997
Get out of here
and leave me alone!

193
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,319
And don't let the boot
hit you on the way out.

194
00:15:34,419 --> 00:15:35,440
The boot?

195
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:38,643
Whoa! Hello. Ow.

196
00:15:38,743 --> 00:15:41,847
Listen! People say
that if someone
brings you this stuff...

197
00:15:41,947 --> 00:15:44,089
that you'll tell them
about trees.

198
00:15:44,189 --> 00:15:46,171
Oh, no, no, no, no. Whoa.

199
00:15:47,472 --> 00:15:49,655
Trees?
Yeah.

200
00:15:49,755 --> 00:15:53,158
Real ones. You know,
that grow out of the ground.

201
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,783
Hello?
Sorry. It's just--

202
00:15:57,883 --> 00:16:00,225
Well, I didn't think anyone
still cared about trees.

203
00:16:00,325 --> 00:16:03,789
Well, that's me.
The guy who still cares.
I'm here.

204
00:16:03,889 --> 00:16:07,232
Hey. What-- What--
Whoa.

205
00:16:07,332 --> 00:16:11,196
You wanna know about trees?
About what happened to them?

206
00:16:11,296 --> 00:16:13,319
Why they're all gone?

207
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:15,160
It's because of me.

208
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,262
Wait. What?

209
00:16:22,187 --> 00:16:24,170
It's because of me!

210
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:30,456
And my invention,
the Thneed.

211
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:34,460
It was an amazing product
that could do the job
of a thousand.

212
00:16:36,082 --> 00:16:39,225
All right. Sounds ridiculous
but, I mean, that's cool.

213
00:16:39,325 --> 00:16:41,327
You're darn right it was cool.

214
00:16:42,648 --> 00:16:45,511
It all started a long time ago.

215
00:16:45,611 --> 00:16:47,713
Can we start
not so long ago maybe?

216
00:16:47,813 --> 00:16:50,516
- Do you want a tree?
- Yes. Yes.

217
00:16:50,616 --> 00:16:53,239
Then it all started a long,

218
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:56,062
long time ago.

219
00:16:57,223 --> 00:16:59,806
I was a young man,
leaving home.

220
00:16:59,906 --> 00:17:01,247
Well, here I go, Mom.

221
00:17:01,347 --> 00:17:04,110
Off to change
the world
with my Thneed.

222
00:17:05,311 --> 00:17:07,213
I'm-- I'm actually doing it.

223
00:17:07,313 --> 00:17:10,056
Yes. But just remember, Oncey--

224
00:17:10,156 --> 00:17:13,099
If somehow your invention
ends up a failure...

225
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,101
instead of a success,

226
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:17,784
oh, it wouldn't
surprise me at all.

227
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:21,067

00:26:33,648 --> 00:26:36,391
All right.
You know what? That's it.

351
00:26:36,491 --> 00:26:38,272
You listen to me,
you furry meat loaf.

352
00:26:38,372 --> 00:26:40,355
I'm gonna chop down
as many trees as I need.

353
00:26:40,455 --> 00:26:42,737
Okay? News flash.
Not going anywhere.

354
00:26:44,299 --> 00:26:46,681
End of story.


355
00:26:46,781 --> 00:26:49,063
Then you leave me
no choice.


356
00:26:51,586 --> 00:26:55,850
If you're not gone
by the time the sun sets
on this valley,

357
00:26:55,950 --> 00:27:00,335
all the forces of nature
will be unleashed upon you...

358
00:27:00,435 --> 00:27:04,659
and curse you
until the end of your days.

359
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:08,883
You have been warned.

360
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:16,952
Thanks.
Yeah. Okay.

361
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,995
You have
been warned.

362
00:27:20,095 --> 00:27:22,918
But I didn't listen
to his warning.

363
00:27:23,018 --> 00:27:25,040
And you won't believe
what happened that night.

364
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:28,483
- What?
- If you wanna hear more,
then come back tomorrow.

365
00:27:28,583 --> 00:27:31,126
Hey, wait. Wait. Tomorrow?

366
00:27:31,226 --> 00:27:34,249
Whoa! Whoa. Whoa-ho-hoa!

367
00:27:34,349 --> 00:27:36,371
Are you serious right now?


368
00:27:36,471 --> 00:27:38,293
You live in the middle
of nowhere.

369
00:27:38,393 --> 00:27:41,056
It stinks out here.
Don't make me come back.

370
00:27:41,156 --> 00:27:43,499
I guess you don't really
wanna hear the rest
of the story.

371
00:27:48,564 --> 00:27:50,546
No, no, no, no.

372
00:27:50,646 --> 00:27:53,589
No, I do.
I really do.
I wanna hear the story.

373
00:27:53,689 --> 00:27:56,712
I just--
Nah. You don't have
what it takes. Good-bye.

374
00:27:56,812 --> 00:27:59,215
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
I have what it takes.

375
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:05,241
It's all right. It's okay.
I'll come back.

376
00:28:05,341 --> 00:28:08,844
It's no problem.
See? Here I am. Leaving.

377
00:28:08,944 --> 00:28:12,188
Walking away now.
I'll see you tomorrow.

378
00:28:12,868 --> 00:28:15,892
Hmm. Maybe.

379
00:28:15,992 --> 00:28:18,414

Well, I'd love to tell you,

I cannot.

Okay. Well, I'll make sure

All right. Cool.
Hey, I gotta run.
I gotta go do a thing.

00:29:45,763 --> 00:29:49,466
- So I'll see you guys.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

401
00:29:49,566 --> 00:29:51,549
You're not going
anywhere, young man.

402
00:29:51,649 --> 00:29:53,951
It's Sunday.
You know what that means.

403
00:29:54,051 --> 00:29:57,795
Family time, and we're all
playing board games.
But--

404
00:29:57,895 --> 00:29:59,757
Hmm.

405
00:29:59,857 --> 00:30:02,800
Mm-hmm.

406
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:05,082
Oh, man.

407
00:30:05,182 --> 00:30:06,484
Mom, seriously.
Every turn?

408
00:30:06,584 --> 00:30:09,126
Hey, back off.
Hmm.

409
00:30:09,226 --> 00:30:11,609
Ooh. Uh, no.

410
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:14,492
Okay! Family time is over.

411

It is now personal time.
I'll be in my room.

Oh. Okay, dear.

413
00:30:20,077 --> 00:30:22,079
Have fun.

414
00:30:23,281 --> 00:30:26,384
I knew I could break her.

415
00:30:26,484 --> 00:30:27,625
Go.
Huh?

416
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:30,288
Go see him.
Oh, yeah!

417
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,752
You rule.
Thank you, Grammy.

418
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:40,999
Whoa.

419
00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:57,155
Hey. Ted, right?

420
00:30:58,276 --> 00:31:01,179
Um, Mr. O'Hare?

421
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:04,262
So, I hear you've become
interested in trees.

422
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,904
What's that all about?

423
00:31:06,004 --> 00:31:07,866
Uh-- Oh, um--

424
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:09,548
Where did you
hear that?

425
00:31:09,648 --> 00:31:11,470
Oh.


426
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:15,033
Teddy, there's not much
that goes on in Thneedville
that I don't know about.

427
00:31:15,133 --> 00:31:18,957
Here's the deal.
I make a living
selling fresh air to people.

428
00:31:19,057 --> 00:31:21,600
Trees? Oh.
They make it for free.

429
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:24,443
So when I hear people
talking about them,

430
00:31:24,543 --> 00:31:26,044
I consider it kind of...

431
00:31:26,144 --> 00:31:28,807
a threat to my business.


432
00:31:28,907 --> 00:31:30,929
Come on, I don't even know
what you're talking about.

433
00:31:31,029 --> 00:31:33,052
You listen to me, boy.

434
00:31:33,152 --> 00:31:36,815
Don't go poking around
in things you don't understand,

435
00:31:36,915 --> 00:31:39,018
or I'll be
your worst nightmare.

436
00:31:39,118 --> 00:31:41,840
I'm Frankenstein's head
on a spider's body!

437
00:31:42,921 --> 00:31:45,304
Yeah. Um.


438
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:47,827
Okay, my mom's
expecting me,
so I'm just gonna--

439
00:31:47,927 --> 00:31:49,949
Of course. Of course.

440
00:31:50,049 --> 00:31:52,872
Now go back
to your family game time.

441
00:31:52,972 --> 00:31:55,995
Grandma just finished her turn.

442
00:31:56,095 --> 00:31:57,636
H-H-How did you know?

443
00:31:57,736 --> 00:32:00,820
Please. I have eyes everywhere.

444
00:32:05,664 --> 00:32:09,008
- Huh?
- You got a beautiful
town here, Ted.

445
00:32:09,108 --> 00:32:12,572
Lots of fun stuff to occupy
your short attention span.

446
00:32:12,672 --> 00:32:14,854
Why, I can't think
of any reason...

447
00:32:14,954 --> 00:32:19,298
you'd ever wanna go
outside of town again.

448
00:32:19,398 --> 00:32:21,400
Ever.

449
00:32:26,285 --> 00:32:28,548
Okay. Good talk.

450
00:32:28,648 --> 00:32:30,650
Really good talk.

451
00:32:54,314 --> 00:32:56,516
- 
- Oh, no.

452
00:32:57,837 --> 00:32:59,839
Look out.


453
00:33:01,801 --> 00:33:05,565
Hey, man. Hey, you know
you need to change
that doorbell.

454
00:33:06,686 --> 00:33:08,749
- Aw, you missed me.
- What?

455
00:33:08,849 --> 00:33:11,031
Well, you're already back.
Clearly you missed me.

456
00:33:11,131 --> 00:33:13,313
A little. Right?

457
00:33:13,413 --> 00:33:17,277
No. I didn't. I just--
I'm here to hear
the end of the story.

458
00:33:17,377 --> 00:33:19,159
Why are you so interested
in trees anyway?

459
00:33:19,259 --> 00:33:20,641
Why aren't you
like other kids,

460
00:33:20,741 --> 00:33:23,043
break dancing
and wearing bell-bottoms...

461
00:33:23,143 --> 00:33:25,365
and playing the Donkey Kongs?

462
00:33:25,465 --> 00:33:28,168
Yeah. Right. Right.

463
00:33:28,268 --> 00:33:30,371
Yeah. I don't know.
Uh, I just--

464
00:33:30,471 --> 00:33:33,774
I just, you know,
thought it'd be kinda cool
to have one, you know.

465
00:33:33,874 --> 00:33:36,777
Uh-huh.
It's a girl, isn't it?

466
00:33:36,877 --> 00:33:38,859
What? No.

467
00:33:38,959 --> 00:33:41,862
Really? 'Cause when a guy
does something stupid once,

468
00:33:41,962 --> 00:33:43,664
well, that's because
he's a guy.

469
00:33:43,764 --> 00:33:46,106
But if he does the same
stupid thing twice,

470
00:33:46,206 --> 00:33:49,029
that's usually
to impress some girl.

471
00:33:49,129 --> 00:33:52,673
Hey, she's not some girl.
She's a woman.

472
00:33:52,773 --> 00:33:55,836
In high school.
And she loves trees.

473
00:33:55,936 --> 00:33:57,478
And I'm gonna get her one.

474
00:33:57,578 --> 00:34:01,002
Aw. How nice to see
someone so undeterred...

475
00:34:01,102 --> 00:34:02,884
by things like reality.

476
00:34:02,984 --> 00:34:06,047
- Thank you.
- All right.
Where did we leave off?

00:38:34,539 --> 00:38:37,722
Whew!
Oh.


525
00:38:37,822 --> 00:38:41,246
I was heading into the light
and you pulled me right back,
and here I am.

526
00:38:41,346 --> 00:38:43,248
You saved my life.

527
00:38:43,348 --> 00:38:45,971
Yeah. I know.
Well, no. It's not
that big a deal.

528
00:38:46,071 --> 00:38:50,015
It is a big deal.
Look. I almost went
over that waterfall.

529
00:38:50,115 --> 00:38:54,740
Wait. My bed.
How did my bed
get in the river?

530
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:59,705
Uh, about that, uh,
actually, um,

531
00:38:59,805 --> 00:39:01,807
I put your bed
in the water.

532
00:39:02,487 --> 00:39:04,710
I didn't mean ya
any harm.

533
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:07,633
I just wanted to calmly
float you away.

534
00:39:07,733 --> 00:39:10,636
Look. Everyone here
needs the trees,

535
00:39:10,736 --> 00:39:13,318
and you're chopping 'em down.

536
00:39:13,418 --> 00:39:16,101
So, we've got a big problem.

537
00:39:22,387 --> 00:39:23,809
All right. Look.

538
00:39:23,909 --> 00:39:28,193
I hereby swear that I will
never chop down another tree.

539
00:39:29,475 --> 00:39:31,136
I promise.

540
00:39:31,236 --> 00:39:35,020
Thank you, but I'm gonna
keep my eye on you.

541
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,463
Good. Now I've got
a big day tomorrow,

542
00:39:37,563 --> 00:39:40,106
so I'm going
to get some sleep.


543
00:39:42,368 --> 00:39:44,950
Right after I find my bed.

544
00:40:02,788 --> 00:40:05,411
- 
- 

545
00:40:05,511 --> 00:40:06,933
Ow. Okay.

546
00:40:07,033 --> 00:40:10,216
Uh, what are you--


547
00:40:10,316 --> 00:40:12,178
Question-- What are
they doing here?

548
00:40:12,278 --> 00:40:14,180
And, uh,

549
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,183
follow up, if I may--
What are you doing here?

550
00:40:17,283 --> 00:40:20,426
Well, after the incident
last night,

551
00:40:20,526 --> 00:40:23,149
we found one of your socks,
and came here to return it.

552
00:40:23,249 --> 00:40:24,631
But when
we got here--
What?

553
00:40:24,731 --> 00:40:27,514
-- you were asleep.
- Ew.

554
00:40:27,614 --> 00:40:30,196
Exactly. And sleeping
is the body's way...

555
00:40:30,296 --> 00:40:32,839
of telling other people
to go away.

556
00:40:32,939 --> 00:40:35,762
I know, but you looked so cozy.

557
00:40:35,862 --> 00:40:39,366
And it was cold outside,
and we just fell asleep.
No harm done.

558
00:40:39,466 --> 00:40:42,769
No harm done?
No harm done? Okay.

559
00:40:44,311 --> 00:40:47,694
Okay, I put my lips on the--
Well, I used to anyway.

560
00:40:49,996 --> 00:40:51,338
Ew.


561
00:40:51,438 --> 00:40:53,440
Did you just--
In my bowl?

562
00:40:56,763 --> 00:40:58,825
That's why you have
one of these.

563
00:40:58,925 --> 00:41:00,927
You don't even have
a mustache.

564
00:41:01,808 --> 00:41:04,631
Okay. That's it.

565
00:41:04,731 --> 00:41:06,794
What? I thought we made
a deal last night.

566
00:41:06,894 --> 00:41:10,237
Yes. We did. And I said
I wouldn't chop down
any more trees.

567
00:41:10,337 --> 00:41:12,519
And I said I was gonna
keep an eye on you.

568
00:41:12,619 --> 00:41:14,521
I'm starving.
What's for breakfast?

569
00:41:16,263 --> 00:41:19,326
Eh, breakfast is overrated.

570
00:41:19,426 --> 00:41:21,929
You know what?

571
00:41:22,029 --> 00:41:23,771
I got work to do.

572
00:41:23,871 --> 00:41:28,295
Yep. I gotta go into town
and sell my Thneed.

573
00:41:28,395 --> 00:41:31,018
You chopped down
one of my trees...

574
00:41:31,118 --> 00:41:33,941
to make that piece
of garbage?


575
00:41:34,041 --> 00:41:36,544
Garbage? Oh, no.

576
00:41:36,644 --> 00:41:39,066
Oh, no!
You do not get it.

577
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:41,549
This is
a revolutionary product...

578
00:41:41,649 --> 00:41:44,392
that will change the world
as we know it.

579
00:41:44,492 --> 00:41:46,033
It has a million uses.

580
00:41:46,133 --> 00:41:48,876
Look at this.
It's a swimsuit.

581
00:41:48,976 --> 00:41:51,199
Po! Mud tracked
all over your floor...

582
00:41:51,299 --> 00:41:52,840
by uninvited guests?

583
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:55,042
Well, the Thneed sure
comes in handy for that.

584
00:41:55,142 --> 00:41:56,644
Whoop-it-up-bup-oh.

585
00:41:56,744 --> 00:41:58,406
But wait. There's more.

586
00:41:58,506 --> 00:42:02,970
Thanks to its all-natural
microfibers, the Thneed
is super absorbent.

587
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:05,533
It also works as a hat.

588
00:42:05,633 --> 00:42:07,135
You probably wanna
wring it out first.

589
00:42:07,235 --> 00:42:09,417
Go ahead. Go ahead.
Knock yourself out.

00:49:00,013 --> 00:49:01,715
Mom!

700
00:49:01,815 --> 00:49:06,400
There he is. There's my big,
suddenly successful son.

701
00:49:08,062 --> 00:49:10,804
We always knew
you'd make it, Oncey. Right?

702
00:49:10,904 --> 00:49:14,448
Hey. I love this guy.

703
00:49:14,548 --> 00:49:17,491
But you always said
I wouldn't amount
to anything, remember?

704
00:49:17,591 --> 00:49:20,534
Oh, hush your mouth. I was just
trying to motivate you.

705
00:49:20,634 --> 00:49:22,777
I'm really glad
that you clarified that...

706
00:49:22,877 --> 00:49:25,700
because it actually
hurt my feelings
for a really long time.

707
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:28,102
Anyway, uh,
you're all here.

708
00:49:28,202 --> 00:49:31,586
You all work for me,
and that's cool,
so let's get to work.

709
00:49:31,686 --> 00:49:34,709
Brett! Chet!
Set up the R.V.

710
00:49:34,809 --> 00:49:36,991
Would you stop throwing
that bear?

711
00:49:37,091 --> 00:49:38,072
Oof.

712
00:50:03,998 --> 00:50:06,421
No, no, no, no.
Whoa. Whoa.

713
00:50:06,521 --> 00:50:08,743
Time out. Back up.
Stop. Don't move an inch.

714
00:50:08,843 --> 00:50:11,546
Nobody's moving in here.
You gotta go. Good-bye.

715
00:50:11,646 --> 00:50:15,270
So who invited
the giant furry peanut?

716
00:50:15,370 --> 00:50:17,873
You calling me a peanut, huh?
I'll go right up your nose.

717
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:20,035
- 
-  Whoa, whoa, whoa!

718
00:50:20,135 --> 00:50:21,356
You wouldn't
hit a woman.

719
00:50:21,456 --> 00:50:23,879
That's a woman?

720
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:26,802
Okay.
Everyone cool it.

721
00:50:26,902 --> 00:50:28,924
Let's not get off
on the wrong foot here.

722
00:50:29,024 --> 00:50:31,446
Um, family,
this is my friend--

723
00:50:31,546 --> 00:50:33,168
Acquaintance.

724
00:50:33,268 --> 00:50:35,971
Acquaintance,
very good acquaintance,
The Lorax.

725
00:50:36,071 --> 00:50:37,933
He speaks for the trees.

726
00:50:38,033 --> 00:50:41,537
That's right. And on behalf
of the trees, get out!

727
00:50:43,118 --> 00:50:45,581
Will you just--
Be nice.

728
00:50:45,681 --> 00:50:47,743
This is my family.

729
00:50:47,843 --> 00:50:51,026
And I'm gonna need their help
if my company's
gonna get bigger. Okay?

730
00:50:51,126 --> 00:50:52,588
Bigger?

731
00:50:52,688 --> 00:50:56,111
Yeah. This isn't some
rinky-dink operation anymore.

732
00:50:56,211 --> 00:50:58,594
I got plans. Big plans.

733
00:50:58,694 --> 00:51:01,757
A vision of a world
filled with Thneeds.

734
00:51:01,857 --> 00:51:03,239
It's gonna be huge.

735
00:51:03,339 --> 00:51:06,562
Which way
does a tree fall?

736
00:51:06,662 --> 00:51:08,664
Uh, down?

737
00:51:09,585 --> 00:51:11,687
A tree falls the way it leans.

738
00:51:11,787 --> 00:51:14,710
Be careful
which way you lean.

739
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:28,905
I mean, look at this.
It's amazing.

740
00:51:29,005 --> 00:51:31,667
I am so proud of me.

741
00:51:31,767 --> 00:51:34,791
Oncey, we've got us
a little problem.

742
00:51:34,891 --> 00:51:37,834
- Problem?
- Mm-hmm.

743
00:51:37,934 --> 00:51:40,436
See, we're not
making Thneeds fast enough.

744
00:51:40,536 --> 00:51:44,300
Harvesting the tufts
takes too long.

745
00:51:52,669 --> 00:51:54,571
Well, what else
can we do?

746
00:51:54,671 --> 00:51:58,935
Well, and this
just came to me,

747
00:51:59,035 --> 00:52:02,018
we could always start
choppin' down the trees.

748
00:52:02,118 --> 00:52:03,660
What?

749
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,703
Whoo! Now you're thinkin'.
That would speed things up.

750
00:52:06,803 --> 00:52:08,625
- But--
- No buts, Oncey.

751
00:52:08,725 --> 00:52:10,387
You're runnin' a business now.

752
00:52:10,487 --> 00:52:13,570
You have to do what's best
for the company and your mama.

753
00:52:15,452 --> 00:52:19,115
Well, I guess it couldn't hurt
to chop down a few trees.

754
00:52:21,097 --> 00:52:23,080
You've made me
so proud, Oncey.

755
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:24,161
Come here.

756
00:52:24,261 --> 00:52:26,863
Hey. I love
this guy.

757
00:52:37,474 --> 00:52:40,177
No, no, no, no!
Stop it. Please stop.

758
00:52:40,277 --> 00:52:43,060
Take that, you stupid tree.
Boom!

759
00:52:47,724 --> 00:52:50,708
Where do you think
you're going?

760
00:52:50,808 --> 00:52:52,509
Excuse me, sir.

761
00:52:52,609 --> 00:52:55,592
I need to talk
with your boss.

762
00:52:55,692 --> 00:52:57,835
Oh, I'm sorry,

763
00:52:57,935 --> 00:53:00,998
but Mr. Once-ler
is not seeing anyone right now.

764
00:53:01,098 --> 00:53:02,439
Yeah, well,
he'll see me, so--

765
00:53:02,539 --> 00:53:04,041
Hey, keep your paws
off me.

766
00:53:04,141 --> 00:53:05,763
Give me a reason, shorty.

767
00:53:05,863 --> 00:53:07,765
Hey, you broke
your promise.

768
00:53:07,865 --> 00:53:09,206
You're better
than this.

769
00:53:09,306 --> 00:53:11,088
You gotta stop.

770
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:12,370
This is bad!

771
00:53:12,470 --> 00:53:15,092
Have a nice day!

772
00:53:18,956 --> 00:53:23,140
Bad? I'm not bad.
I'm the good guy here.
He just doesn't get it.

773
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:25,623
Do you think I'm bad?


774
00:53:25,723 --> 00:53:29,947
Thank you.
I mean, something good
finally happens to me,

775
00:53:30,047 --> 00:53:33,431
and he just has to come along
and rain on my parade.

776
00:53:33,531 --> 00:53:34,752

You fill that hole

844
00:57:20,281 --> 00:57:22,503
or do you still need more?

845
00:57:22,603 --> 00:57:25,386
Look. If you've got a problem
with what I'm doing,

846
00:57:25,486 --> 00:57:29,771
why haven't you used
your "powers" to stop me?

847
00:57:31,973 --> 00:57:34,636
I told you.
That's not how it works.

848
00:57:34,736 --> 00:57:37,839
Right. I forgot.
You're a fraud.

849
00:57:37,939 --> 00:57:40,381
I need you to get out. Now.

850
00:57:41,582 --> 00:57:43,685
Why? Do I make you
uncomfortable?

851
00:57:43,785 --> 00:57:45,527
Remind you of
the promises you made?

852
00:57:45,627 --> 00:57:47,689

853
00:57:47,789 --> 00:57:51,012
You know what?
You can just shut
your mustache.

854
00:57:51,112 --> 00:57:52,293
My conscience is clear.

855
00:57:52,393 --> 00:57:55,297
I have done nothing illegal.
I have my rights.

856
00:57:55,397 --> 00:57:57,979
And I intend to keep on
biggering and biggering...

857
00:57:58,079 --> 00:57:59,941
and turning more Truffula trees
into Thneeds.

858
00:58:01,443 --> 00:58:03,665
And nothing
is going to stop me.

859
00:58:20,902 --> 00:58:22,564
Well, that's it.

860
00:58:22,664 --> 00:58:24,666
The very last one.

861
00:58:25,787 --> 00:58:27,789
That may stop you.

862
00:58:49,011 --> 00:58:51,273
Somebody sure made a bundle
on that thing.

863
00:58:51,373 --> 00:58:54,236
Wonder what the next
million-dollar invention's

let me down.

my favorite child.

867
00:59:40,263 --> 00:59:42,325
Hey, look.
I don't want
any trouble.

868
00:59:42,425 --> 00:59:45,708
And you won't get any.
Not from them.

869
00:59:47,630 --> 00:59:50,333
Thanks to you and your hackin'
and smoggin' and gluppin',

870
00:59:50,433 --> 00:59:51,935
they can't live here anymore.

871
01:00:00,684 --> 01:00:02,586
So I'm sending 'em off.

872
01:00:02,686 --> 01:00:05,769
Hopefully, they'll be able
to find a better place
out there somewhere.

873
01:00:09,973 --> 01:00:12,716
- Melvin?
- 

874
01:00:12,816 --> 01:00:14,818
Melvin.

875
01:00:15,419 --> 01:00:17,421
Hey, Pipsqueak.

876
01:00:21,104 --> 01:00:23,106
Hey.

877
01:01:34,459 --> 01:01:37,041
So this is really
all your fault.

878
01:01:37,141 --> 01:01:39,143
You destroyed everything.

879
01:01:39,664 --> 01:01:41,086
Yes.

880
01:01:41,186 --> 01:01:43,768
And each day
since The Lorax left,

881
01:01:43,868 --> 01:01:46,891
I've sat here regretting
everything I've done.

882
01:01:46,991 --> 01:01:49,054
Staring at that word.

883
01:01:49,154 --> 01:01:51,536
"Unless."

884
01:01:51,636 --> 01:01:54,819
And-- And wondering
what it meant.

885
01:01:54,919 --> 01:01:56,341
But now I'm thinking.

886
01:01:56,441 --> 01:02:00,946
Well, maybe you're the reason
The Lorax left that word there.

887
01:02:01,046 --> 01:02:04,189
Me? Why would he
leave that for me?

888
01:02:04,289 --> 01:02:07,833
Because unless someone like you
cares a whole awful lot,

889
01:02:07,933 --> 01:02:09,935
nothing is going to get better.

890
01:02:10,856 --> 01:02:12,858
It's not.

891
01:02:30,996 --> 01:02:34,099
The last Truffula seed.

892
01:02:34,199 --> 01:02:36,542
You need to plant it, Ted.

893
01:02:36,642 --> 01:02:39,985
Yeah, but nobody cares
about trees anymore.

894
01:02:40,085 --> 01:02:41,747
Then make them care.

895
01:02:41,847 --> 01:02:44,990
Plant the seed in the middle
of town where everyone can see.

896
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:47,833
Change the way
things are.

897
01:02:47,933 --> 01:02:50,436
I know it may seem small
and insignificant,

898
01:02:50,536 --> 01:02:52,838
but it's not about
what it is.

899
01:02:52,938 --> 01:02:55,201
It's about what it can become.

900
01:02:55,301 --> 01:02:59,385
That's not just a seed
any more than you're just a boy.

901
01:03:07,994 --> 01:03:09,996
I won't let you down.

902
01:03:11,237 --> 01:03:13,239
I know.

903
01:03:32,458 --> 01:03:34,040
Meow. Meow.

904
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:36,142
Meow. Meow.

905
01:03:38,184 --> 01:03:41,027
Me-e-o-w.

906
01:03:55,362 --> 01:03:57,644
Hey, Audrey! Audrey!

907
01:03:59,246 --> 01:04:01,188
Ted? What are you doing?

908
01:04:01,288 --> 01:04:02,349
Meet me at my house.

909
01:04:02,449 --> 01:04:05,132
Uh, wait. But--
My house, okay?

910
01:04:07,374 --> 01:04:09,116
Gotta plant the seed.
Gotta plant the seed.

911
01:04:09,216 --> 01:04:11,558
Okay, we're gonna need,
uh, water, and, uh,

912
01:04:11,658 --> 01:04:13,080
something to dig with.

913
01:04:13,180 --> 01:04:14,761
Um, what-- what do I have--

914
01:04:14,861 --> 01:04:17,885
Ted?
Ugh. Mom, I'm busy, Mom!

915
01:04:17,985 --> 01:04:20,167
Theodore Wiggins,
get down here right now,

916
01:04:20,267 --> 01:04:23,150
and I am not
kidding with you.


917
01:04:28,515 --> 01:04:30,738
Ted, I'd like you
to meet Mr. O'Hare,

918
01:04:30,838 --> 01:04:33,020
the most powerful man
in town.

919
01:04:34,521 --> 01:04:37,344
There he is.
Hello, Ted.

920
01:04:37,444 --> 01:04:40,267
Uh, hi.

921
01:04:40,367 --> 01:04:42,349
Isn't he clever,
Mr. O'Hare?

922
01:04:42,449 --> 01:04:44,692
He knows his own name
and everything.

923
01:04:46,814 --> 01:04:50,157
You know what I would love
right now, Mrs. Wiggins?

924
01:04:50,257 --> 01:04:53,361
A delicious cookie.


925
01:04:53,461 --> 01:04:55,122
Uh--
Wonderful.

926
01:04:55,222 --> 01:04:57,204
Teddy and I'll stay here
and talk.

927
01:04:57,304 --> 01:04:59,847
Sure. Why don't you
go ahead and adopt him?

928
01:04:59,947 --> 01:05:01,609
I'm just kidding.

929
01:05:01,709 --> 01:05:04,412
That was a joke,
and I just was joking.

930
01:05:04,512 --> 01:05:06,514
I'll get your cookie.

931
01:05:07,074 --> 01:05:10,098
I know you have it, Ted.

932
01:05:10,198 --> 01:05:12,840
So let's put an end
to this nonsense, shall we?

933
01:05:13,761 --> 01:05:15,343
Hand it over.

934
01:05:15,443 --> 01:05:18,906
I'm sorry. I-I don't know
what you're talking about.

935
01:05:19,006 --> 01:05:23,231
Really? Well, then,
I guess you wouldn't mind us
checking your room.

936
01:05:23,331 --> 01:05:26,474
- No, no, no, no!
- Morty! McGurk!
Find the seed!

937
01:05:26,574 --> 01:05:29,397
No. You can't go up there.
No, guys, this is ridiculous.
Stop.

938
01:05:29,497 --> 01:05:30,959
Up. Up.

939
01:05:31,059 --> 01:05:32,520
Hey!


940
01:05:32,620 --> 01:05:34,622
No. You can't come in my room.

941
01:05:35,623 --> 01:05:38,426
Find it!


942
01:05:42,590 --> 01:05:43,972
Find it!

943
01:05:44,072 --> 01:05:46,214
What-- What is going on here?

944
01:05:46,314 --> 01:05:50,098
This doesn't involve you.
Get back downstairs.

945
01:05:50,198 --> 01:05:53,942
Excuse me, down there.
I don't care who you are,
you little crazy baby man.

946
01:05:54,042 --> 01:05:57,225
Get out of my house now.
This is outrageous.

947
01:05:57,325 --> 01:05:59,628
Fine. Sorry.


948
01:05:59,728 --> 01:06:01,790
Must've been
a misunderstanding.

949
01:06:01,890 --> 01:06:05,534
We'll be leaving now.
And my apologies, Ted.

950
01:06:08,497 --> 01:06:10,499
You be safe.

951
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:14,163
Wha--
Mind telling me
what's going on here?

952
01:06:14,263 --> 01:06:15,924
The seed.
Where is it?

953
01:06:16,024 --> 01:06:18,026
- Seed?
- 

954
01:06:18,467 --> 01:06:20,469
Where's Grammy?

955
01:06:22,471 --> 01:06:24,473
It's alive.

956
01:06:25,874 --> 01:06:29,158
I remember you.

957
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:32,982
Ted, what--
Uh--

958
01:06:39,889 --> 01:06:41,891
Audrey.

959
01:06:43,292 --> 01:06:45,294
Hey, did you wanna--
Well, okay.

960
01:06:46,896 --> 01:06:48,517
Ted, what is this about?

961
01:06:48,617 --> 01:06:50,659
It's about this.

962
01:06:51,701 --> 01:06:54,163
Wait, wait, wait.
Is that--

963
01:06:54,263 --> 01:06:56,886
Yes. The last Truffula seed.
And you're gonna help me
plant it...

964
01:06:56,986 --> 01:06:59,729
right in the middle of town
where everyone can see it.

965
01:06:59,829 --> 01:07:01,831
I could just kiss you
right now.

966
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:06,856
Hup! We don't
have time for that.

967
01:07:06,956 --> 01:07:08,978
I don't know.
We have a little time.

968
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:11,861
But you know what?
Let's just go.

969
01:07:11,961 --> 01:07:13,963
Let's go.
Forget about it.

970
01:07:14,564 --> 01:07:16,986
- Huh?
- 

971
01:07:47,837 --> 01:07:49,499
Here it comes.

972
01:07:53,043 --> 01:07:55,045
I'm going for it.

973
01:08:11,542 --> 01:08:13,884
Oh, hello.

974
01:08:13,984 --> 01:08:16,326
- Huh?
- 

975
01:08:26,997 --> 01:08:28,939
Ted. Ted.
Big, scary blimp coming.

976
01:08:29,039 --> 01:08:30,621
Ugh.

977
01:08:40,771 --> 01:08:42,393
Whoa!


978
01:08:42,493 --> 01:08:44,915
You won't get away
with this, boy!

979
01:08:45,015 --> 01:08:47,017
Bang.

980
01:08:56,107 --> 01:08:58,449
Go faster, you idiot!

981
01:08:58,549 --> 01:09:00,551
What?
Yeah!

982
01:09:01,232 --> 01:09:02,814
Step on it, Ted.

983
01:09:07,879 --> 01:09:09,100
Hmm?


984
01:09:12,283 --> 01:09:15,466
- Ooh.
- 
You're fired.

985
01:09:15,566 --> 01:09:18,650
- Whoa. Ted, look out.
- 

986
01:09:22,253 --> 01:09:24,355
- Nobody beats--
- Ted!

987
01:09:24,455 --> 01:09:26,878
--Aloysius O'Hare!

988
01:09:28,580 --> 01:09:30,822
♪♪ 

989
01:09:36,828 --> 01:09:40,191
Whoa. This is not good.
How's it doing?

990
01:09:49,841 --> 01:09:52,064
Loser!

991
01:09:52,164 --> 01:09:54,166
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, really?

992
01:09:54,806 --> 01:09:56,228
Oh, no.

993
01:09:56,328 --> 01:09:58,330
The seed!

994
01:10:00,412 --> 01:10:02,414
Get that seed!

995
01:10:04,176 --> 01:10:06,178
Hey!

996
01:10:08,460 --> 01:10:10,242
Hang on.
Here we go!

997
01:10:12,544 --> 01:10:14,546
Grammy!

998
01:10:20,432 --> 01:10:22,434
Ha!

999
01:10:22,915 --> 01:10:25,197
Seriously, how cool
is your grandma?

1000
01:10:26,999 --> 01:10:28,901
Oh. Mwah.


1001
01:10:29,001 --> 01:10:31,003
Huh? Whoa!

1002
01:10:32,164 --> 01:10:34,166
No.

1003
01:10:37,369 --> 01:10:38,951
Come on!

1004
01:10:39,051 --> 01:10:40,433
Yeah. That's right.

1005
01:10:40,533 --> 01:10:42,535
There it is.

1006
01:10:51,344 --> 01:10:54,487
Hey, hey, hey!
Watch the road,
you meathead!

1007
01:11:01,594 --> 01:11:04,857
Hey. Ow. Ow.
Oh, come on!

1008
01:11:14,367 --> 01:11:17,150
What the--


1009
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:19,692
Get it unstuck!
Get it unstuck!

1010
01:11:21,294 --> 01:11:23,416
Bring it on, Teddy.

1011
01:11:24,577 --> 01:11:26,239
You don't have the guts.

1012
01:11:26,339 --> 01:11:28,321
Ted!

1013
01:11:35,789 --> 01:11:37,791
Grammy.

1014
01:11:42,235 --> 01:11:44,177
Yes!

1015
01:11:46,199 --> 01:11:48,061
Hey. Hey, hey, hey!

1016
01:11:48,161 --> 01:11:50,163
- Hey, it's Mr. O'Ha--
- 

1017
01:11:51,685 --> 01:11:53,987
Take that, shorty.


1018
01:11:59,693 --> 01:12:01,695
So we hike up to the falls,
and we're standing--

1019
01:12:11,024 --> 01:12:13,327
Okay, we have to get this
in the ground.

1020
01:12:13,427 --> 01:12:15,569
But where? There's--
There's no dirt anywhere.

1021
01:12:15,669 --> 01:12:17,671
Ooh.

1022
01:12:18,952 --> 01:12:20,955
- No. Uh, Grammy--
- 

1023
01:12:22,476 --> 01:12:23,737
Whoa.

1024
01:12:25,399 --> 01:12:27,521
Whoopsie.
 Hey,
get out of there.

1025
01:12:33,367 --> 01:12:35,109
Hey.

1026
01:12:35,209 --> 01:12:37,491
What? What?

1027
01:12:39,093 --> 01:12:42,156
See, what'd I tell you?
Easy, huh?

1028
01:12:42,256 --> 01:12:44,599
Hey, they broke
O'Hare's head.

1029
01:12:44,699 --> 01:12:46,921
What do you think
you're doing, kid?

1030
01:12:47,021 --> 01:12:50,284
Uh, I'm looking for a place
to plant a tree.

1031
01:12:50,384 --> 01:12:51,606
A real one.

1032
01:12:51,706 --> 01:12:53,408
Why would we need
a tree?

1033
01:12:53,508 --> 01:12:57,311
- Exactly.
- 

1034
01:12:58,152 --> 01:13:00,174
Oh, man.

1035
01:13:00,274 --> 01:13:01,976
Folks--


1036
01:13:02,076 --> 01:13:05,660
the last thing you want
around here is trees.

1037
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:07,582
They're filthy.

1038
01:13:07,682 --> 01:13:11,266
Spewing that sticky,
nasty sap...

1039
01:13:11,366 --> 01:13:13,368
all over the place.

1040
01:13:14,729 --> 01:13:16,431
They bring poisonous ants...

1041
01:13:16,531 --> 01:13:18,113
and stinging bees.

1042
01:13:18,213 --> 01:13:19,434
Hey.

1043
01:13:19,534 --> 01:13:22,597
Ouch. Think about
the kids.

1044
01:13:22,697 --> 01:13:26,721
And I just thought of, you know,
they-- they make leaves!

1045
01:13:26,821 --> 01:13:29,524
You know that, right?
Then these leaves,
they just fall.

1046
01:13:29,624 --> 01:13:31,766
They just fall
wherever they want.

1047
01:13:33,308 --> 01:13:35,370
Come on. We know why
you're really against trees.

1048
01:13:35,470 --> 01:13:37,612
Because they produce
fresh air.

1049
01:13:37,712 --> 01:13:38,894
For free.

1050
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:44,660
I am wounded.
You have lied.

1051
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:48,303
It is not a lie.
It's called photosynthesis.

1052
01:13:48,403 --> 01:13:50,626
Come on.
She's making that up.

1053
01:13:50,726 --> 01:13:53,508
That's a made-up word, people.

1054
01:13:53,608 --> 01:13:57,593
Thneedville is perfect
just the way it is.

1055
01:13:57,693 --> 01:13:59,755
We don't need trees.

1056
01:13:59,855 --> 01:14:03,879
That boy has a seed.
We need to stop him!

1057
01:14:03,979 --> 01:14:05,361
Who's with me?
Come on.

1058
01:14:05,461 --> 01:14:06,642
O'Hare's right!

1059
01:14:06,742 --> 01:14:09,044
Seeds will ruin us all!
Stop it!

1060
01:14:09,144 --> 01:14:11,527
 I'm afraid of seeds!
Last chance, kid.

1061
01:14:11,627 --> 01:14:13,088
Hand it over.

1062
01:14:13,188 --> 01:14:14,490
Where do you think you're going?

1063
01:14:14,590 --> 01:14:16,372
Come on. Let's go.

1064
01:14:16,472 --> 01:14:18,294
Get in. Get in!

1065
01:14:21,757 --> 01:14:23,779
Stop that maniac!

1066
01:14:26,001 --> 01:14:28,484
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Watch out!

1067
01:14:32,448 --> 01:14:35,071
Ted, you're gonna
hit the wall.

1068
01:14:35,171 --> 01:14:37,173
Yeah. I know.

1069
01:15:01,117 --> 01:15:03,259
Wow. Did you see that?

1070
01:15:03,359 --> 01:15:06,242
Who does this kid
think he is, huh?

1071
01:15:07,724 --> 01:15:12,328
I am Ted Wiggins,
and I speak for the trees.

1072
01:15:13,329 --> 01:15:15,151
And the fact is...

1073
01:15:15,251 --> 01:15:18,274
things aren't perfect
here in Thneedville.

1074
01:15:18,374 --> 01:15:22,078
And they're only gonna get worse
unless we do something about it.

1075
01:15:22,178 --> 01:15:25,121
Unless we change our ways.

1076
01:15:25,221 --> 01:15:28,004
And we can start
by planting this.

1077
01:15:37,274 --> 01:15:40,978
Okay. Come on now.
Everything's fine.

1078
01:15:41,078 --> 01:15:42,379
Right?

1079
01:15:42,479 --> 01:15:45,962
I say we tell this kid
what we think about that seed.

1080
01:15:49,166 --> 01:15:51,168
People. Come on!

1081
01:15:54,611 --> 01:15:58,916
You. Get out there right now
and get these people on my side.

1082
01:15:59,016 --> 01:16:01,438
