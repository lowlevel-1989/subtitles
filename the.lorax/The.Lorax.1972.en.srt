1
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:45,133
At the far end of town
Where the Grickle-grass grows

2
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:49,300
And the wind smells slow and sour
When it blows

3
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:53,187
And no birds ever sing
Excepting old crows

4
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:56,895
Is the Street of the Lifted Lorax

5
00:00:57,516 --> 00:01:01,271
Grickle-grass, Grickle-grass

6
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:05,191
Street of the Lifted Lorax

7
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:09,407
Grickle-grass, Grickle-grass

8
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:15,748
Somebody lifted the Lorax away

9
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,003
What was the Lorax?

10
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,584
And why was it there?

11
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:23,421
And why was it lifted
and taken somewhere...

12
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:27,430
from the far end of town
where the Grickle-grass grows?

13
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:29,966
The old Once-ler still lives here.

14
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:33,928
Ask him. He knows.

15
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:37,223
You won't see the Once-ler.
Don't knock at his door.

16
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:40,188
He lurks in his Lerkim
on top of his store.

17
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,854
And on Grickle-y midnights in August,
he peeks out of the shutters...

18
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:49,118
and sometimes he speaks
and tells how the Lorax was lifted away.

19
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,412
It all started way back.

20
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:55,245
Such a long, long time back.

21
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:58,877
Way back in the days
when the grass was still green...

22
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:03,212
and the pond was still wet
and the clouds were still clean...

23
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:07,448
and the song of the Swomee-Swans
rang out in space.

24
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:13,137
One morning,
I came to this glorious place.

25
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:17,517
Then I saw the trees, the Truffula Trees.

26
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,057
The bright-colored tufts
of the Truffula Trees.

27
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,736
Mile after mile
in the fresh morning breeze.

28
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:27,899
And under the trees,
I saw Brown Bar-ba-loots...

29
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:31,069
frisking about in their Bar-ba-loot suits.

30
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:32,952
Under the trees

31
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,863
Happy, dappy Bar-ba-loots

32
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:38,500
Under the trees in our Bar-ba-loot suits

33
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:41,503
Under the trees eating Truffula Fruits

34
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:43,756
- Oh, these succulent
- Mellifluous

35
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:45,632
- Deliciously
- Delifluous

36
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,589
Sweetly succulifluous

37
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:48,923
Truffula fruits

38
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,338
Summertime's a-comin', comin'

39
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:53,098
Under the trees

40
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,974
Humming-Fish are hummin', hummin'

41
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,201
Under the trees

42
00:02:58,804 --> 00:02:59,896
Under the trees

43
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:01,978
- Oh, these glorious
- Splendembulous

44
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,187
Splendorious

45
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,944
- Splendimulous
- Namby-flamby, flimbulous

46
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:07,855
Truffula Trees

47
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:10,903
Those trees. Those trees.

48
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,784
Those Truffula Trees.

49
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:16,117
All my life I've been searching
for trees such as these.

50
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:19,283
The touch of their tufts
was much softer than silk.

51
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:23,795
And they had the sweet smell
of fresh butterfly milk.

52
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:27,128
I felt a great leaping of love
in my heart.

53
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:31,796
I knew just what I'd do.
I unloaded my cart.

54
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,399
In no time at all,
I had built a small shop.

55
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:53,318
Then I chopped down a Truffula Tree
with one chop.

56
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:00,995
What you doing in my tree stump, buddy?

57
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:04,287
Your tree stump?

58
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:06,046
Mister, I am the Lorax.

59
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,047
- I speak for the...
- Forget it. Hmp.

60
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:11,130
I don't really need the stump.
You can have it, little fellow.

61
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,489
Aha. Just enough to finish the cuffs.

62
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,490
A thing of beauty is a joy forever.

63
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:39,029
Now, uh, uh, oh, oh, who do you
say you were, little fella?

64
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:41,540
Mister, I am the Lorax.

65
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,416
I speak for the trees.

66
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:46,829
I speak for the trees
for the trees have no tongues.

67
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,999
And I'm asking you, sir,
at the top of my lungs.

68
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:54,511
That thing,
that horrible thing that I see...

69
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:58,219
what's that thing you've made
out of my Truffula Tree?

70
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:01,180
Look, Lorax, calm down.
There's no cause for alarm.

71
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:04,396
I chopped down just one tree.
I'm doing no harm.

72
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:08,525
Hah. This thing is most useful.
This thing is a Thneed.

73
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:12,529
A Thneed,
a fine something that all people need.

74
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,732
It's a shirt.

75
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:16,070
It's a sock.

76
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,860
It's a glove.

77
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,152
It's a hat.

78
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,196
But it has other uses.

79
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:22,910
Yes, far beyond that.

80
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:26,748
You can use it for carpets,
for pillows, for sheets or curtains...

81
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,254
or covers for bicycle seats.

82
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,756
Sir, you're crazy.

83
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:33,792
You're crazy with greed.

84
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:38,931
Why, there's no one on earth
who would buy that fool Thneed.

85
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,906
The birth of an industry,
you poor, stupid guy.

86
00:05:57,065 --> 00:06:00,314
You telling me what the public will buy?

87
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,920
Please, I object,
in the name of the trees.

88
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:15,130
All complaints will be filed in this box,
if you please.

89
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,920
Now I had reached the stage
where the potential was known.

90
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,260
This business was too big
for one Once-ler alone.

91
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:23,016
Promptly I built me a radio phone.

92
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,973
I called my brothers, uncles
and aunts. I said, "Listen here.

93
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:29,390
Here's a wonderful chance for
the whole Once-ler family to get rich."

94
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:32,935
Get over here fast. Take the road to
North Nitch. Turn left at Weehawken.

95
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,603
Sharp right at South Stitch.

96
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,984
Don't stand around gawkin'

97
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:41,368
Turn left at Weehawken
To the Once-ler's house we go

98
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,278
Don't waste your time talkin'

99
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:48,497
Turn left at Weehawken
To the house of the glorious Once-ler we go

100
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,662
Opportunity's knockin'
There'll be no more squawkin'

101
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,296
We're gonna get rich

102
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:54,669
Filthy rich

103
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,629
No more holes in our stockin'

104
00:06:56,791 --> 00:07:03,640
Turn left at Weehawken
To the house of the glorious Once-ler we go

105
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:07,474
Gentlemen, I wish to speak for the trees.

106
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:10,856
Here are some facts to cogitate
and ruminate.

107
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:15,144
It takes 10 months for a Truffula seed
to germinate.

108
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:19,486
It takes 10 long years
before the seed grows into a sapling.

109
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:22,116
It takes 10 more years...

110
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:29,492
And, in no time at all,
in the factory I built...

111
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:32,662
the whole Once-ler family
was working full tilt.

112
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:36,001
We were all knitting Thneeds
just as busy as bees...

113
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:39,714
to the sound of the chopping
of Truffula Trees.

114
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:49,310
Then, oh, baby, oh,
how my business did grow.

115
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,643
Now chopping trees one at a time
was too slow.

116
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:55,980
So I promptly invented
my Super-Axe-Hacker...

117
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:59,692
which whacked off
four Truffula Trees in one smacker.

118
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:10,032
We were making Thneeds
four times as fast as before...

119
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:14,704
and my profits, incidentally,
were soaring galore.

120
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:24,714
Hmm, inadequate roadways.
I want a four-lane highway over there.

121
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,679
Instant Roadway Company,
at your service, sir.

122
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,016
I speak for the trees.

123
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:20,777
Let them grow. Let them grow.

124
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:27,572
But nobody listens too much,
don't you know?

125
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,281
I speak for the trees.

126
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:31,446
And I'll yell and I'll shout...

127
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:35,337
for the fine things on Earth
that are on the way out.

128
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:43,712
They say I'm old-fashioned
and live in the past.

129
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:47,470
But sometimes I think progress
progresses too fast.

130
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:03,023
They say I'm a fool
to oppose things like these...

131
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:07,487
but I'm going to continue to speak
for the trees.

132
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:15,165
I'm going to continue to speak
for the trees.

133
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:27,548
It's always fair weather

134
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:32,136
When good Once-lers get together

135
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:39,557
I'm going to continue
to speak for the trees.

136
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:01,328
Off the old assembly line

137
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,292
Comes another Thneed

138
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:07,084
Answering humanity's
Each and every need

139
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,050
Everybody do, do, do
Do, do need a Thneed

140
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,135
It isn't just a tanning vest

141
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:15,096
Use it for a hammock when you need rest

142
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,260
A toothbrush holder for your weekend guest

143
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:19,350
Your canary will love it
It's a lovely nest

144
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,185
Try it in soup, it adds great zest

145
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,566
It will cure those backache pains
In your chest

146
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:25,398
Everybody do, do, do

147
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,107
Do, do need a Thneed

148
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:31,446
You'll be amazed, you'll be nonplussed
It tastes like bread without the crust

149
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,451
Grooms your hair when it gets mussed

150
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,408
Rids your home of dismal dust

151
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,117
It's a natural, it's a must

152
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,533
Eliminates carburetor rust

153
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:43,124
Everybody do, do, do
Do, do need a Thneed

154
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:45,505
It's super-duper, hooper-hyper

155
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,381
Makes a perfect windshield wiper

156
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,383
Foolproof trap to catch a viper

157
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,340
We've no complaints from any griper

158
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,379
Papa smokes 'em in his piper

159
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,389
- Baby says
- Boy, what a diaper

160
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,550
Everybody do, do, do

161
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,390
Everybody do, do, do

162
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:03,728
Everybody do, do, do
Do need a Thneed

163
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:17,363
Today we're here to celebrate

164
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:20,407
Perpetuate and demonstrate

165
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,543
Our love for the good ol' Once-ler

166
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:26,830
Founding father of the Thneed

167
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:30,508
Three cheers for the good ol' Once-ler

168
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:34,922
Georgie Washington of the Thneed

169
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,931
Very heartwarming.

170
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,843
Very heartwarming.

171
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:45,516
Oh, place your hand upon your heart

172
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:51,314
And recollect his humble start

173
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:57,202
He came here in a horse-drawn cart

174
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,537
Upon his sacred mission

175
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:07,205
Today the Once-ler's fame has grown

176
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:14,386
Today the name of Thneed is known

177
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:21,223
It's carved in everlasting stone

178
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:27,062
Everlasting stone

179
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:34,399
And seen on television

180
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:42,243
For he's a jolly good Once-ler
Aren't we all?

181
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:44,248
Nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand...

182
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:46,000
nine hundred and ninety-five.

183
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:51,507
Ninety-six, 97, 98, 99, 1 million.

184
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:58,722
Stop it! Stop it!

185
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,848
There's something I've got to tell you.

186
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:06,514
Huh? Oh, it's Nature Boy,
the garden club member.

187
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,432
Now, listen all of you. I am the Lorax.

188
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,851
I speak for the trees.

189
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,440
Whoops.

190
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:19,312
That was the Lorax.
He spoke for the trees.

191
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,243
Miss Funtzler, Miss Funtzler?

192
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:29,501
Yes, Mr. Once-ler?

193
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,879
Miss Funtzler, send in Miss O'Schmunsler.

194
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,587
Miss O'Schmunsler for Mr. Once-ler.

195
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:37,093
Take a letter, Mr. Once-ler?

196
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,300
Take a letter, Miss O'Schmunsler

197
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,557
To my cousin Yenna Yuntzler

198
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:48,313
General manager, Thneeds Incorporated
Stockholm, Sweden

199
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:50,098
Dear Yonni

200
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:53,568
I'm overjoyed to hear how our business
in the Scandinavian market is...

201
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,444
by leaps and bounds speeding.

202
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:59,233
The entire international picture
is most exuberantly rosy and...

203
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,907
Mr. Once-ler, he's back.

204
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:07,244
That Lorax nut is back again.

205
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:12,663
Yes, I am the Lorax
who speaks for the trees...

206
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:16,584
which you seem to be chopping
as fast as you please.

207
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:20,341
But I'm also in charge
of the Brown Bar-ba-loots...

208
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:23,097
who played in the shade
in their Bar-ba-loot suits...

209
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:25,679
and happily lived, eating Truffula Fruits.

210
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:29,683
Now thanks to your hacking my trees
to the ground...

211
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:32,356
there's not enough Truffula Fruit
to go around.

212
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,861
I see your point, yes,
I do see your point.

213
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:41,195
They loved living here,
but I can't let them stay.

214
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,904
They'll have to find food.

215
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,661
And I hope that they may.

216
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,032
Good luck, boys. Good luck.

217
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,701
Bar-ba-loot suits

218
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:54,371
Bar-ba-loot suits

219
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:59,043
Hikin' off to somewhere
In our Bar-ba-loot suits

220
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,548
Please think about it, would you?

221
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:18,107
Every once in a while

222
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:21,193
I sit down with myself asking

223
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:25,735
"Once-ler, why are you a Once-ler?"

224
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:31,659
And I cringe, I don't smile
As I sit there on trial asking

225
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:36,421
"Aren't you ashamed, you old Once-ler?

226
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:40,671
You ought to be locked in a hoosegow,
you should.

227
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:45,930
The things that you do
are completely ungood."

228
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,510
Yeah. Ha, ha.

229
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,346
But if I didn't do them

230
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:54,015
Then someone else would

231
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:59,732
"That's a very good point, Mr. Once-ler."

232
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:05,446
Progress is progress,
and progress must roll.

233
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:12,456
Things were going just fine
all the way down the line.

234
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:16,210
Thneeds were selling like hotcakes
from Timbuktu to Texas.

235
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:21,967
I was feeling quite relaxed
in my good old solar plexus...

236
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:24,968
when he snuck out of a pipe.

237
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:28,631
He was back with another gripe.

238
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:33,561
Once-ler, you're making
such smogulous smoke.

239
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:37,849
My poor Swomee-Swans,
why, they can't sing a note.

240
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:41,360
No one can sing
who has smog in his throat.

241
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:43,566
And so...

242
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:47,199
Please pardon my cough.

243
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:48,826
They cannot live here.

244
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,745
I am sending them off.

245
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,156
Where will they go?

246
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,949
Where will they go?

247
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:56,834
I don't hopefully know.

248
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:03,841
Will there be another dawn?

249
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:08,505
A sunrise for the Swomee-Swan

250
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:13,055
Exit, exit Swomee-Swan

251
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:20,226
Going, going, going, gone

252
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:24,028
What do you want,
I should shut down my factory?

253
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:27,360
Fire a hundred thousand workers?
Is that good economics?

254
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,491
Is that sound for the country?

255
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:33,029
I see your point,
but I wouldn't know the answer.

256
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:36,537
Tell you what I'll do. I'll think it over.

257
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:37,700
No!

258
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:41,709
You've run out of time
for thinking things over!

259
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:45,626
I'm sorry to yell, but my dander is up.

260
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,385
Let me say a few words
about gluppity-glupp.

261
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:52,094
Your machinery chugs on
day and night without stop...

262
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:55,385
making gluppity-glupp
and also schloppity-schlopp.

263
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,952
You're glumping the pond
where the Humming-Fish hummed.

264
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:16,910
No more can they hum,
for their gills are all gummed.

265
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,412
So I'm sending them off.

266
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,327
Oh, their future is dreary.

267
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:26,633
I hear things are just as bad
up in Lake Erie.

268
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:35,267
Just fish out of water on hard, dry land

269
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:40,897
People ain't fish
So they can't understand

270
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:46,562
What happens when simple things
Get out of hand

271
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:53,702
And the fish and his family's
On hard, dry land

272
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:56,370
Well, Mr. Once-ler?

273
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:57,576
Hmp.

274
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:01,163
First the poor Bar-ba-loots,
then the poor Swomee-Swans.

275
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,248
Now the poor Humming-Fish.

276
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:04,628
Oh, Mr. Lorax.

277
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:11,215
Mr. Lorax, this cursed factory of mine,
now at last I understand.

278
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:12,629
Mr. Once-ler, Mr. Once-ler!

279
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:13,842
Huh?

280
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,972
Oh, uh, yes, Miss Funtzler.

281
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:19,557
Stock market has just closed,
and Thneeds Incorporated stock is up.

282
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,813
Up 27 and five-eighth points.

283
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:24,065
Wow. Wow.

284
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,816
Rowdy-dow!

285
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:29,070
Now, you listen to me, pop,
while I blow my top.

286
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:31,484
Trees.

287
00:20:31,614 --> 00:20:33,316
You speak for the trees.

288
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:38,079
Well, I speak for men
and human opportunities.

289
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,665
For your information, you Lorax...

290
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:44,953
I'm figgering on biggering
and biggering...

291
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:47,167
and biggering and biggering.

292
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:50,425
Turning more Truffula Trees
into Thneeds...

293
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:56,431
which everyone, everyone, everyone needs!

294
00:20:57,882 --> 00:21:01,335
And at that very moment,
we heard a loud whack...

295
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:04,230
from outside in the fields
came the sickening smack...

296
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,561
of an axe on a tree.

297
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:09,273
Then we saw the tree fall.

298
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:13,360
The very last Truffula Tree of them all.

299
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:14,774
No more trees.

300
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,116
No more Thneeds. No more work to be done.

301
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:24,872
And in no time my uncles and aunts,
everyone all waved me goodbye.

302
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:30,799
They jumped into their cars and drove
away under smoke-smuggered stars.

303
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:38,723
For he's a jolly good Once-ler

304
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:40,929
Aren't we all?

305
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:44,220
For he's a jolly good Once-ler

306
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:49,643
Aren't we all?

307
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:57,818
Now all that was left
beneath the bad-smelling sky...

308
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:03,160
was my big, empty factory,
the Lorax, and I.

309
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,370
The Lorax said nothing.

310
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:07,251
Just gave me a glance.

311
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:11,130
Just gave me a very sad,
sad backward glance.

312
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,757
As he lifted himself
by the seat of his pants, and I...

313
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:17,170
I'll never forget the grim look
on his face when he heisted himself...

314
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:21,136
and took leave of this place
through a hole in the smog...

315
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,847
without leaving a trace.

316
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:27,434
And all that the Lorax left here
in this mess...

317
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:31,817
was a small pile of rocks with one word.

318
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:34,194
"Unless"?

319
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:37,732
Yes, unless.

320
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,859
What's an unless?

321
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:45,198
Just a faraway word

322
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:48,538
Just a faraway thought

323
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:51,795
A thought? About what?

324
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:53,877
About something I ought?

325
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:55,837
Well...

326
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,924
A thought about something

327
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:02,340
That somebody ought

328
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:05,806
A thought about something

329
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:10,394
That somebody ought

330
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:13,730
Unless someone like you
cares a whole awful lot...

331
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:15,566
nothing is going to get better.

332
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,522
It's not.

333
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:20,574
Hold on a minute. Where is it now?

334
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,244
Uh, don't go, don't go.
I've got something for you.

335
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:29,250
Ah, here it is. It's a Truffula seed.
It's the last one of all.

336
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:31,251
Catch, don't muff.

337
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:40,344
You're in charge
of the last of the Truffula seeds.

338
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:43,847
And Truffula Trees
are what everyone needs.

339
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:45,679
Plant a new Truffula.

340
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,514
Treat it with care.

341
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:51,271
Give it clean water and feed it fresh air.

342
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,932
Grow a forest.

343
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,817
Protect it from axes that hack.

344
00:23:55,976 --> 00:24:01,153
Then the Lorax and all of his friends
may come back.
