1
00:02:25,063 --> 00:02:26,981
Are we the first?

2
00:02:29,859 --> 00:02:32,237
Are we the first to arrive here?

3
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:52,465
Mr. Wilson!

4
00:03:13,403 --> 00:03:15,488
Is the interpreter with you?

5
00:03:16,614 --> 00:03:18,950
I'm not a, uh, professional interpreter.

6
00:03:19,117 --> 00:03:21,578
My occupation is cartography.

7
00:03:22,203 --> 00:03:23,580
I'm a mapmaker.

8
00:03:23,788 --> 00:03:26,708
Can you translate French into English
and English into French?

9
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:30,086
Yes, yes, I explained to
the team leader in Villa Hermosa.

10
00:03:30,295 --> 00:03:32,589
I'm just a little taken by surprise.

11
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,138
How long have you
been working on this project?

12
00:03:40,305 --> 00:03:45,268
I've been with
the American team from the beginning.

13
00:03:45,435 --> 00:03:49,981
In fact, I saw you at the Montsoreau
conference which ended well...

14
00:03:50,148 --> 00:03:53,318
...especially for you.
Especially for the French.

15
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:56,112
If it isn't too late, my congratulations.

16
00:03:58,281 --> 00:04:01,284
They're all there! All of them!

17
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:14,881
Check for landing marks!

18
00:04:39,739 --> 00:04:43,451
Mr. Lacombe wants
the numbers off the engine blocks!

19
00:04:46,746 --> 00:04:49,666
M-447148!

20
00:04:49,874 --> 00:04:54,253
W-445529!

21
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:57,924
Number 445529, check!

22
00:04:58,132 --> 00:05:02,679
Approximately 46 gallons
in the right tank!

23
00:05:02,887 --> 00:05:04,681
447149, check!

24
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:07,266
Tell me something.
What the hell is happening here?

25
00:05:07,517 --> 00:05:09,852
- It's flight number 19!
- Nineteen what?

26
00:05:10,103 --> 00:05:13,856
It's that training mission from
the naval air station at Fort Lauderdale.

27
00:05:14,357 --> 00:05:17,151
They were doing target runs
on an old hulk.

28
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,779
Who flies crates like these anymore?

29
00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:24,742
No one! These planes
were reported missing in 1945.

30
00:05:29,831 --> 00:05:31,499
But it looks brand-new!

31
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,714
Where's the pilot?

32
00:05:38,548 --> 00:05:40,800
I don't understand!

33
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:43,594
Where's the crew? Hey!

34
00:05:47,765 --> 00:05:50,601
How the hell did it get here?!

35
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:24,802
He says this guy is local.

36
00:06:25,011 --> 00:06:26,929
He was here last night.
He saw it happen.

37
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:51,996
Sunburn?

38
00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:11,057
He says the sun came out last night.

39
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:14,811
He says it sang to him.

40
00:07:51,097 --> 00:07:53,307
Harry, keep an eye
on that point-out I gave you.

41
00:07:53,558 --> 00:07:55,560
He's on 122.5.

42
00:07:55,768 --> 00:07:57,270
I'll be right back.

43
00:07:59,063 --> 00:08:02,567
<i>Indianapolis
Center, you have traffic for Air East 31?</i>

44
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:05,695
Air East 31, negative.

45
00:08:05,945 --> 00:08:10,867
The only traffic I have is a TWA
L-1011 in your 6 o'clock position...

46
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:13,369
...range 15 miles...

47
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:17,582
...and an Allegheny DC-9
in your 12 o'clock position, 50 miles.

48
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:20,668
Stand by one. I'll take
a look at broadband, over.

49
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,505
<i>Air East 31 has traffic 2 o'clock,
slightly above and descending.</i>

50
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:26,716
Air East 31, roger.

51
00:08:26,966 --> 00:08:29,969
I have a primary target
about that position now.

52
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:31,929
I have no known high-altitude traffic.

53
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,140
Stand by one, I'll check low, over.

54
00:08:34,724 --> 00:08:37,226
Dick, will you check low-altitude,
see if they know who this is?

55
00:08:37,435 --> 00:08:38,811
<i>Center, Air East 31.</i>

56
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,022
<i>The traffic's not lower than us.</i>

57
00:08:41,272 --> 00:08:44,692
<i>He's 1 o'clock now,
still above me and descending.</i>

58
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:48,237
Air East 31, can you say aircraft type?

59
00:08:49,113 --> 00:08:52,783
<i>Negative, Center, uh, no distinct outline.</i>

60
00:08:53,326 --> 00:08:56,954
<i>Uh, to tell you the truth,
the target is rather brilliant.</i>

61
00:08:57,163 --> 00:09:01,125
<i>It has the brightest anti-collision lights
I think I've ever seen.</i>

62
00:09:01,334 --> 00:09:03,461
<i>Alternating white to red.</i>

63
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,546
<i>The colors are a little striking.</i>

64
00:09:05,755 --> 00:09:09,008
<i>Center, this is TWA 517.</i>

65
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:12,470
<i>Traffic now looks like
extra-bright landing lights.</i>

66
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:15,806
<i>I thought Air East
had his landing lights on.</i>

67
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:18,267
It could be a satellite.

68
00:09:18,434 --> 00:09:22,939
Air East 31, I have a primary target now in
your 10 o'clock position, five miles, over.

69
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:25,316
- Never seen anything like that.
<i>- Affirmative, 31.</i>

70
00:09:25,483 --> 00:09:27,193
The traffic is proceeding
northeast-bound.

71
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,945
No altitude readout.

72
00:09:29,153 --> 00:09:32,073
<i>Roger, Center. It doesn't
appear he's gonna be a problem now.</i>

73
00:09:32,323 --> 00:09:35,660
<i>He's going to descend
about 1500 feet below me.</i>

74
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:37,453
<i>Wait a second!</i>

75
00:09:37,703 --> 00:09:38,955
<i>Stand by one.</i>

76
00:09:39,789 --> 00:09:42,500
<i>Okay, Center, Air East 31.
The traffic has turned.</i>

77
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:47,755
<i>He's heading for my windshield. We're
turning right and leaving flight level 350.</i>

78
00:09:47,922 --> 00:09:50,216
Air East 31,
descend and maintain flight level 310.

79
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:52,301
Break Allegheny, turn right 30 degrees.

80
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:57,139
Get on the horn to the 45th Recon Wing,
see what the hell they're testing up there.

81
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:01,268
This is Indianapolis Center. Are there any
test operations in restricted area 2508?

82
00:10:01,477 --> 00:10:03,062
<i>Air East 31, roger.</i>

83
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:07,358
<i>The traffic is quite luminous, exhibiting
some non-ballistic motion, over.</i>

84
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:10,277
Roger, Air East 31. Continue
descent at your discretion, over.

85
00:10:10,486 --> 00:10:13,572
<i>Okay, Center. Descent
at pilot's discretion is approved.</i>

86
00:10:13,781 --> 00:10:16,742
<i>The traffic is approaching head-on,
ultra-bright and really moving.</i>

87
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,663
<i>And right by us! Right now!
Now that was really close.</i>

88
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:23,708
<i>Air East 31 is out of 340....</i>

89
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:26,043
Ask them if they want to report officially.

90
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:30,214
TWA 517,
do you want to report a UFO? Over.

91
00:10:34,719 --> 00:10:38,556
TWA 517,
do you want to report a UFO? Over.

92
00:10:40,558 --> 00:10:43,602
<i>Negative. We don't want to report.</i>

93
00:10:43,811 --> 00:10:47,023
Air East 31, do you wish
to report a UFO? Over.

94
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:51,485
<i>Negative. We don't want to
report one of those either.</i>

95
00:10:52,028 --> 00:10:55,781
Uh, Air East 31, do you wish to
file a report of any kind? Over.

96
00:10:56,532 --> 00:10:59,493
<i>I wouldn't know what kind
of report to file, Center.</i>

97
00:10:59,744 --> 00:11:01,746
Air East 31, me neither.

98
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:04,290
I'll try to track traffic
to destination, over.

No way! Dad said we could finish
watching <i>The Ten Commandments!</i>

119
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,585
Roy, that movie
is four hours long, you know.

120
00:15:18,794 --> 00:15:20,713
I told them they'd watch
only five commandments.

121
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:23,882
Hello? Hi, Earl.

00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:29,555
Oh, you know Roy can't drive at night
without me. Heh-heh.

124
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,143
Wait, wait, wait, I can't-- Hey, honey.

125
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:38,397
Jiminy Cricket! It's Earl on the phone.

126
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,901
Just a second.

00:15:43,068 --> 00:15:45,487

<i>- Neary.</i>

128
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:48,490
<i>Listen to me, now.
Get over to the Gilmore substation.</i>

129
00:15:48,657 --> 00:15:50,701
<i>We've lost the power

Yay!

Hey! Lights!

136
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,083
Crystal Lake is dark.

137
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,294
I understand the system's failing.
What do you want me to do?

138
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:46,215
Let it all fail. Let it all fail. We'll pick up
the pieces later after it's fallen.

139
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:50,010
Let's do things my way, all right?
I got reports of vandalism on the line.

140
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:52,304
I got eight 90-megawatt lines
down all over.

141
00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:55,516
- Crystal Lake is dark.
- Tolono is completely gone.

142
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:58,560
It doesn't matter. It's down. It's down!

143
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:03,982
What's the normal tension for that area?

144
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:08,487
If there's no wind? Normal tension
for the sag is 15,000 pounds per wire.

145
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:11,573
I was a journeyman in that area
a few years back.

146
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,784
Good, an expert.

147
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:20,165
- How would you like the job?
- You're kidding. Where's the seniority?

148
00:17:20,332 --> 00:17:22,417
Well, it's not up to me.
Where's the supervisor?

149
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:26,046
Supervisor's stuck in an elevator, running
the show from one of the trouble phones.

150
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:28,590
But I'm in charge here right now,
and you're going to Crystal Lake.

151
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:29,967
- I am?
- I can't help it.

152
00:17:30,134 --> 00:17:31,301
Everybody's everywhere.

153
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:33,971
Now, if you have any questions,
get on the horn to me direct.

154
00:17:34,138 --> 00:17:35,430
Got a fresh impedance coming up.

155
00:17:35,806 --> 00:17:38,100
It's not an overload. It's a drain.

156
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:40,644
Lines M-Mary-10 through M-Mary-15.

157
00:17:40,811 --> 00:17:42,312
Municipal Lighting
is asking to be cut free.

158
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:46,066
Neary, you know where that is? And grab
a splicing tool and a high-wire act.

159
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:48,402
And, Neary, don't get creative
out there, just productive.

160
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:51,363
Remember, he's counting on you
and I'm depending on you.

161
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:54,616
You tell Municipal Lighting we're going to
candle power in 10 minutes!

162
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:08,172
Barry!

163
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,973
Barry!

164
00:18:30,694 --> 00:18:32,738
Help. I'm lost.

165
00:18:32,905 --> 00:18:35,282
<i>- Go, Ed.
- Responding to that 10-16....</i>

166
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:38,202
Hold on. You're gonna
cough up a little Tolono, right?

167
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:41,872
Cough up a Tolono
or an interstate, a Highway 90.

168
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,416
A little familiar landmark of some sort.

169
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,210
<i>Cornbread Road, south of 20.</i>

170
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:47,628
Cornbread?

171
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:49,755
<i>Power must have been restored
up there.</i>

172
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:53,175
<i>Couple hundred neighbors in their P.J.s
think it's Saturday night out here.</i>

173
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:54,509
<i>Dispatch, this is 411.</i>

174
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:57,554
<i>Do you want me to disregard
that Tolono call?</i>

175
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:03,018
You're in the middle of the road, jackass!

176
00:19:03,644 --> 00:19:06,688
Can you tell me where Cornbread is?
Turkey!

177
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:38,095
Eight thirty-four, 834.... F-27.

178
00:19:39,388 --> 00:19:42,516
M-Mary-10 through M-Mary-12. Okay.

179
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:44,559
<i>Ten-47.</i>

180
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:47,604
Well, it's all meaningless so far.

181
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:49,189
Okay, come on.

182
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:52,234
All right. Four-way stop
leads you to the single-circuits...

183
00:19:52,401 --> 00:19:54,528
...and leads you right to nowhere.

184
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:58,824
M-Mary-10.

185
00:20:29,187 --> 00:20:33,734
<i>Unit 211, 10-30, five, sev--</i>

186
00:21:05,182 --> 00:21:06,892
Oh, shit.

187
00:22:41,862 --> 00:22:43,738
Ah! Ah!

188
00:22:56,668 --> 00:23:01,256
<i>Unit 211, I'm back on the street.
What do you guys got out there?</i>

189
00:23:01,923 --> 00:23:03,758
<i>I don't believe this!</i>

190
00:23:04,468 --> 00:23:06,553
<i>My God! It's bigger than a house!</i>

191
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:10,640
<i>This thing is like a barn.</i>

192
00:23:11,433 --> 00:23:13,852
<i>This is absolutely crazy.</i>

193
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:18,064
<i>What is your location?</i>

194
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:21,902
<i>Just off Telemark Expressway
and east toward Harper Valley.</i>

195
00:24:27,425 --> 00:24:29,261
Barry.

196
00:24:30,345 --> 00:24:31,471
No!

197
00:24:31,846 --> 00:24:33,098
Watch out!

198
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,273
Oh, my God! Lady! Lady!

199
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:43,358
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

200
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:46,069
I didn't even see him. He was just
standing right in the middle of the road.

201
00:24:47,362 --> 00:24:49,364
- Hello?
- Oh, my God.

202
00:24:49,531 --> 00:24:51,032
Hello! Here!

203
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:52,909
What's the matter with you?

204
00:24:53,827 --> 00:24:57,914
Barry, come back here! Come on, now.

205
00:25:27,861 --> 00:25:28,778
Ice cream!

206
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:43,209
They can fly rings around the moon.

207
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:45,837
But we're years ahead of them
on the highway.

208
00:25:54,888 --> 00:25:56,723
This is nuts.

209
00:25:57,891 --> 00:25:58,933
No.

210
00:26:39,724 --> 00:26:40,767
Wait a minute!

211
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:44,771
What are you guys doing? Hey!

212
00:26:44,979 --> 00:26:47,690
That's Ohio! That's a quarter!

213
00:26:52,612 --> 00:26:56,533
Jesus, look at that. Look at those
suckers. They're glued to the road!

214
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,957
Honey, wake up.

215
00:27:46,666 --> 00:27:49,794
Honey, Ronnie, wake up.
You're not gonna believe what I saw.

216
00:27:49,961 --> 00:27:51,671
- Ronnie.
- Don't! Not now.

217
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,632
No, no, no, listen, Ronnie!
I never would have believed it.

218
00:27:54,841 --> 00:27:57,427
There was this, uh--
In the cab there was this whole--

219
00:27:57,635 --> 00:28:00,096
It went-- It was--
There was a red whoosh that--

220
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:04,851
Roy, um, Ike called you.

221
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:07,353
- I gotta get something to wear here.
And, um, McGovern.

222
00:28:07,562 --> 00:28:10,398
They want you to call them right away.
They said they couldn't reach you.

223
00:28:10,565 --> 00:28:11,858
I turned the radio off.

224
00:28:12,108 --> 00:28:14,277
Don't do that.
The phone's been ringing off the hook.

225
00:28:14,444 --> 00:28:18,114
It woke Sylvia up two times already.
And I think you'd better call them.

226
00:28:18,323 --> 00:28:21,576
You know those pictures in the <i>National
Geographic</i> about the aurora borealis?

227
00:28:21,784 --> 00:28:24,454
This is better than that.
This is really-- Come on!

228
00:28:24,621 --> 00:28:26,414
Come on, Ronnie, get up. Come on.

229
00:28:26,581 --> 00:28:27,624
No, Roy, what's wrong?

230
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:30,293
I don't know if anything's wrong.
Get up. I'm not kidding.

231
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,503
Is it an accident?

232
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:34,464
It's not an accident. You wanted to
get out of the house anyway, right?

233
00:28:34,631 --> 00:28:36,466
No, not at 4:00 in the morning.

234
00:28:36,716 --> 00:28:40,220
Ronnie, I need you
to see something with me.

235
00:28:40,428 --> 00:28:42,222
It's really important.

236
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:45,016
Okay. All right. What about the kids?

237
00:28:45,225 --> 00:28:46,976
What? Oh, the kids! I'll get the kids.

238
00:28:47,227 --> 00:28:49,229
Sylvia, come on,
we're going on a little adventure.

239
00:28:49,646 --> 00:28:52,273
Toby! Brad! Come on! Get up.
Up, move, come on.

240
00:28:52,482 --> 00:28:54,025
It's better than Goofy Golf! Come on!

241
00:28:57,362 --> 00:29:00,782
- Go faster.
- I'm going as fast as I can!

242
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:02,909
Come on.

243
00:29:04,577 --> 00:29:08,081
All right, all right. Oh, hi, Mrs. Harris.

244
00:29:08,331 --> 00:29:09,958
Roy, there's Mrs. Harris.

245
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:13,711
There better be a good reason for doing
this, because it doesn't make any sense.

246
00:29:15,129 --> 00:29:19,008
All right, Roy, I really think
you've proved your point.

247
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:22,262
Roy. Roy.

248
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:24,681
Roy, you're sunburned. Look at you.

249
00:29:26,933 --> 00:29:28,601
Wow.

250
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,605
Honey, what is that?

251
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:39,654
Roy, what did it look like?

252
00:29:40,655 --> 00:29:42,865
It was like an ice-cream cone.

253
00:29:44,784 --> 00:29:46,202
What flavor?

254
00:29:46,411 --> 00:29:47,704
Orange.

255
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,124
It was orange.
And it wasn't like an ice-cream cone.

256
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:53,668
It was more like a shell.
You know, it was like this:

257
00:29:53,918 --> 00:29:55,295
Like a taco?

258
00:29:55,545 --> 00:30:00,174
Was it like one of those Sara Lee, um,
moon-shaped, cookies?

259
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:02,969
Those crescent cookies?

260
00:30:11,602 --> 00:30:14,147
Don't you think I'm taking this really well?

261
00:30:17,775 --> 00:30:21,738
I remember when we used to come to
places like this just to look at each other.

262
00:30:26,284 --> 00:30:27,785
Snuggle.

263
00:31:27,095 --> 00:31:28,346
Is this the bathroom?

264
00:31:28,513 --> 00:31:29,722
Shh!

265
00:31:31,432 --> 00:31:32,642
Psst!

266
00:31:46,989 --> 00:31:50,368
Hey, this is not your toy to play with
every time I turn around.

267
00:31:50,618 --> 00:31:52,412
He looks like a 50/50 Bar.

268
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:56,249
All right, out of this house.
All of you. Out of my house.

269
00:31:56,499 --> 00:31:58,835
I'm sorry, but you're not
to play with this ever!

270
00:31:59,043 --> 00:32:01,712
Get out while I clean up your mess!

271
00:32:02,004 --> 00:32:03,840
Thank you very much.

272
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,610
Roy, I found this overnight-tanning stuff.

273
00:32:24,819 --> 00:32:28,781
I want you to spray it on half of your face,
so your face looks all even, one color.

274
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:32,034
It makes my face look yellow.
What does this remind you of, Ronnie?

275
00:32:32,869 --> 00:32:35,079
Then we'll just tell everybody
that you fell asleep...

276
00:32:35,329 --> 00:32:37,165
...under the sun lamp on your right side.

277
00:32:37,498 --> 00:32:38,749
What for?

278
00:32:40,334 --> 00:32:42,795
- Dad, can I ask you a question?
- What?

279
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:44,464
Are they for real?

280
00:32:44,672 --> 00:32:47,758
That's what for. No, they are not for real.

281
00:32:48,009 --> 00:32:50,303
Now, I want you to go outside
and have a hot dog, okay?

282
00:32:50,553 --> 00:32:52,138
Ronnie, don't tell him that.

283
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:56,017
Roy, don't talk about this until you know
what you're talking about, okay?

284
00:32:56,267 --> 00:33:00,271
Ronnie, that's crazy. If I can't talk about it,
how am I gonna know what's going on?

285
00:33:00,521 --> 00:33:03,399
- What?
- Mom, I believe in them.

286
00:33:03,608 --> 00:33:06,986
- I believe in them too.
- Oh, no, you don't.

287
00:33:07,236 --> 00:33:08,863
Dad says we do.

288
00:33:09,113 --> 00:33:10,907
No, he does not.

289
00:33:11,699 --> 00:33:14,035
- Do you, Roy?
- Ronnie.

290
00:33:14,202 --> 00:33:17,705
All I wanna do is know what's going on.

291
00:33:17,955 --> 00:33:21,083
Nothing's going on!
It's just one of those things.

292
00:33:21,334 --> 00:33:23,085
Which things? Which things?

293
00:33:23,794 --> 00:33:26,631
- I don't wanna hear about this anymore.
- Ronnie, this is very important!

294
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:29,592
I'm not just gonna let it lay here.
I'm gonna call somebody about this!

295
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:31,928
I'm not listening. I'm not listening.

296
00:33:32,136 --> 00:33:34,847
Ronnie, I saw something
last night that I can't explain.

297
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:39,519
I saw something last night
I can't explain.

298
00:33:41,479 --> 00:33:43,773
I'm going out there again tonight,
you know.

299
00:33:45,942 --> 00:33:49,237
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

300
00:33:49,654 --> 00:33:51,948
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

301
00:33:55,076 --> 00:33:56,410
No, you're not.

302
00:33:56,619 --> 00:33:57,954
Do they live on the moon?

303
00:33:58,204 --> 00:34:02,416
They got bases on the moon.
At night they come through your window.

304
00:34:02,667 --> 00:34:04,544
This isn't a moonburn,
you know, goddamn it!

305
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:07,463
You live on the moon. I saw it,
you came through my window last night.

306
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:08,881
You hurt me!

307
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:11,759
- You took all my covers.
- Roy's not like that.

308
00:34:11,968 --> 00:34:14,554
- You did!
- He loves his work. Don't say that!

309
00:34:14,762 --> 00:34:17,223
What did he do?
He was with us all night!

310
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:18,933
Ronnie, I won't have to go tonight.

311
00:34:19,183 --> 00:34:21,102
He is not like that at all!

312
00:34:21,269 --> 00:34:24,146
- I don't believe it. You did!
- Stop yelling at me!

313
00:34:24,313 --> 00:34:26,941
- Shh, shh!
- Can't you tell him about this?

314
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:28,442
Hello?

315
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:30,528
I can't believe it.

316
00:34:30,736 --> 00:34:32,029
Roy...

317
00:34:32,363 --> 00:34:34,031
...you got fired.

318
00:34:34,991 --> 00:34:37,076
They didn't even wanna talk to you.

319
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:42,790
I mean, I don't understand this, Roy.

320
00:34:43,124 --> 00:34:44,417
Roy.

321
00:34:48,254 --> 00:34:49,922
What is happening here?

322
00:34:53,384 --> 00:34:55,303
We were up all night.

323
00:34:57,263 --> 00:35:02,476
I'm not getting a job, you know?
I'm not getting a job.

324
00:35:21,203 --> 00:35:22,788
That's not right.

325
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:54,695
Hello?

326
00:35:55,696 --> 00:35:56,739
Hi.

327
00:35:57,073 --> 00:35:59,325
Oh, hi, how are you? You came here too?

328
00:35:59,492 --> 00:36:01,202
Yes. Jillian Guiler.

329
00:36:01,369 --> 00:36:03,621
Roy Neary. I'm sorry about
what happened with the kid.

330
00:36:03,788 --> 00:36:06,499
- Good night.
- What?

331
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:09,668
Look at you.

332
00:36:11,879 --> 00:36:13,005
Oh....

333
00:36:13,172 --> 00:36:15,925
- You got the same burn.
- Ha-ha.

334
00:36:16,092 --> 00:36:19,178
Yeah, but it's better on you.
You got it all over at least.

335
00:36:20,638 --> 00:36:21,847
I gotta tan the other side tonight.

336
00:36:23,432 --> 00:36:25,142
How's the kid? I'm really sorry.

337
00:36:25,309 --> 00:36:26,894
Uh-- I'll be right back.

338
00:36:27,103 --> 00:36:29,605
Raise your head a bit and give me
a smile. Come on, son.

339
00:36:29,772 --> 00:36:34,318
Hey, he's a little young for
a record, don't you think? Hm?

340
00:36:53,212 --> 00:36:54,713
Weird.

341
00:36:56,382 --> 00:37:01,095
I know this sounds crazy,
but ever since yesterday on the road....

342
00:37:01,846 --> 00:37:04,098
I've been seeing this shape.

343
00:37:06,183 --> 00:37:09,145
In shaving cream and pillows....

344
00:37:21,657 --> 00:37:25,244
Damn it, I know this. I know what this is.

345
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:33,294
This means something.

346
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:41,510
This is important.

347
00:37:42,261 --> 00:37:44,180
- Here they come!
- Get the camera!

348
00:37:45,514 --> 00:37:48,559
- Out of the northwest!
- Jimmy, come here.

349
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:05,201
It's like Halloween for grownups.

350
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,454
Trick or treat.

351
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,778
Wait a minute.

352
00:40:27,593 --> 00:40:29,261
I want to know...

353
00:40:29,428 --> 00:40:31,972
...from what direction
did your people hear these sounds?

354
00:40:37,144 --> 00:40:38,979
Where were the sounds coming from?

355
00:41:05,673 --> 00:41:08,217
Where did these sounds come from?
Tell us, please.

356
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:21,563
Where did these sounds come from?

357
00:41:36,203 --> 00:41:38,622
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

358
00:41:43,043 --> 00:41:47,047
I beg your pardon,
but my English is not good too.

359
00:41:49,842 --> 00:41:51,468
I want to share with you now...

360
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:55,013
...the breakthrough
that happened in India.

361
00:41:55,389 --> 00:41:58,434
We think it means something.

362
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:02,396
We think it is important.

363
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:07,943
To help you learn, I am using
the hand sign created by Zoltán Kodály.

364
00:42:09,069 --> 00:42:14,324
Kodály developed these signs
to teach music to deaf children.

365
00:42:53,697 --> 00:42:54,782
And now....

366
00:43:17,763 --> 00:43:18,806
Here are the patterns.

367
00:43:19,056 --> 00:43:21,391
We just received
two 15-minute broadcasts.

368
00:43:21,558 --> 00:43:22,726
Are these non-random signals?

369
00:43:22,893 --> 00:43:26,480
A hundred and four rapid pulses.
After a five-second interval, 40 pulses.

370
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:29,107
Another five-second break,
and 30 pulses.

371
00:43:29,399 --> 00:43:32,861
Sixty seconds of silence, and then
an entirely new set of numbers.

372
00:43:33,028 --> 00:43:36,114
Forty, break five.
Thirty-six, break five. Ten.

373
00:43:36,323 --> 00:43:38,492
- A hundred and four rapid pulses.
- Lord.

374
00:43:38,742 --> 00:43:42,454
Wait 60 seconds
and the whole doggone thing repeats.

375
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:45,874
- Where are these signals coming from?
- Right in the neighborhood.

376
00:43:46,041 --> 00:43:48,001
Light-travel time,
roughly seven seconds.

377
00:43:48,252 --> 00:43:50,379
It's well within the plane of the ecliptic.

378
00:43:50,629 --> 00:43:55,467
Are these non-random signals here,
40, 36, 10, in response to that?

379
00:43:55,717 --> 00:43:59,096
No. They should be. We've been sending
out this musical combination for weeks.

380
00:43:59,263 --> 00:44:01,306
But all we're getting back are numbers.

381
00:44:06,854 --> 00:44:10,566
This could mean the India sounds
reached a dead end.

382
00:44:10,899 --> 00:44:12,192
They don't mean a thing.

383
00:44:12,401 --> 00:44:14,444
There's still so much that we don't know.

384
00:44:14,653 --> 00:44:17,281
How about where the signals originate?

385
00:44:20,284 --> 00:44:22,870
- Excuse me.
- Maybe they're letters.

386
00:44:23,954 --> 00:44:25,956
What letter is 104?

387
00:44:28,375 --> 00:44:29,710
Excuse me.

388
00:44:32,921 --> 00:44:36,008
Before I got paid to, uh,
speak French....

389
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:38,969
I, uh....

390
00:44:39,136 --> 00:44:40,721
I used to read maps.

391
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:45,183
This first number is a longitude.

392
00:44:49,104 --> 00:44:52,274
I've got two sets of three numbers.

393
00:44:52,482 --> 00:44:55,444
Degrees, minutes and seconds.

394
00:44:55,652 --> 00:44:59,865
Now, the first number has three digits,
and the last two are below 60.

395
00:45:00,824 --> 00:45:04,036
Obviously, it's not in the right ascension
and declination on the sky.

396
00:45:05,412 --> 00:45:07,789
These have to be Earth coordinates.

397
00:45:07,998 --> 00:45:10,000
There's a globe
in the county supervisor's office.

398
00:45:13,503 --> 00:45:14,838
This is what we need.

399
00:45:15,047 --> 00:45:17,549
Maybe there's a release pin
underneath here.

400
00:45:17,966 --> 00:45:20,260
That's a $2500 globe!
What are you guys doing?

401
00:45:20,427 --> 00:45:23,221
- It's heavy, watch your feet.
- Let me hit the mother.

402
00:45:26,141 --> 00:45:28,352
No, no, clear it through.

403
00:45:38,487 --> 00:45:42,324
All right, everybody, calm down!
Hold it down! Quiet!

404
00:45:45,535 --> 00:45:46,912
That's not right.

405
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:48,872
The antenna. How dumb! Huh?

406
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:51,375
- Which way is the antenna pointing?
- Northeast.

407
00:45:51,583 --> 00:45:53,085
That's Wyoming.

408
00:45:59,925 --> 00:46:02,386
We're going to need a geodetic
survey map of Wyoming.

409
00:46:02,636 --> 00:46:04,471
I want this down to the square yard.

410
00:46:04,721 --> 00:46:07,808
Get me a geodetic survey map
of Wyoming.

411
00:46:07,975 --> 00:46:09,643
We not only need....

412
00:47:59,628 --> 00:48:01,254
Toys!

413
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,299
Toys!

414
00:48:36,206 --> 00:48:37,916
Come on, come on.

415
00:49:21,501 --> 00:49:23,003
Oh, my God!

416
00:49:51,781 --> 00:49:54,117
You can come and play now.

417
00:49:54,367 --> 00:49:56,161
You can come and play now.

418
00:50:01,458 --> 00:50:04,127
Come in through the door.

419
00:50:06,004 --> 00:50:09,341
One, two, three....

420
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:19,476
Oh, honey.

421
00:50:19,684 --> 00:50:21,811
Mom, look! The sun's here!

422
00:50:24,898 --> 00:50:27,025
Oh, honey.

423
00:50:27,692 --> 00:50:29,527
Oh, my God!

424
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:34,407
<i>♪ The moment you come into view ♪</i>

425
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:50,382
<i>♪ Just because ♪</i>

426
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:53,802
<i>♪ My composure sort of slips ♪</i>

427
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:58,431
<i>♪ The moment
That your lips meet mine ♪♪</i>

428
00:51:07,524 --> 00:51:09,109
Go away!

429
00:51:12,487 --> 00:51:14,239
Bang!

430
00:51:33,341 --> 00:51:34,759
Clean everything up!

431
00:51:51,026 --> 00:51:53,153
- Mom, let me listen.
- Wait a minute. Wait.

432
00:52:10,795 --> 00:52:12,339
- Mom, look!
- Oh, my God.

433
00:52:21,014 --> 00:52:23,433
Come in through the door.

434
00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:49,501
Barry! Barry!

435
00:52:59,511 --> 00:53:00,887
Jillian. Jillian.

436
00:53:03,848 --> 00:53:05,225
May we have a statement?

437
00:53:05,391 --> 00:53:08,311
The report you gave
to the police was really quite spectacular.

438
00:53:08,478 --> 00:53:10,647
We need it for the 6:00 news.

439
00:53:10,814 --> 00:53:12,357
- Jillian.
- Mrs. Guiler?

440
00:53:13,274 --> 00:53:14,609
They got him.

441
00:53:14,776 --> 00:53:15,819
What?

442
00:53:15,985 --> 00:53:18,613
Is it true you're leaving
the state to look for your son?

443
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:20,365
Has there been a ransom note?

444
00:53:20,532 --> 00:53:22,367
Where would you start looking?

445
00:53:24,702 --> 00:53:26,538
His name is Barry.

446
00:53:27,413 --> 00:53:29,499
Where is your husband now, Mrs. Guiler?

447
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,546
Are you involved
in any kind of parapsychologies?

448
00:53:35,547 --> 00:53:37,632
Turn around, please. Turn around!

449
00:53:39,801 --> 00:53:41,636
You gave the police a report.

450
00:53:41,803 --> 00:53:44,347
Would you mind repeating it
for the television?

451
00:53:47,058 --> 00:53:50,186
Folks, you can go in now. Room 3655.

452
00:53:50,645 --> 00:53:54,023
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is a flying saucer.

453
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:56,192
That's the one I saw.

454
00:53:58,236 --> 00:54:01,489
I swear that's the same one.
It's the one I saw.

455
00:54:02,824 --> 00:54:05,451
It's made of pewter, made in Japan...

456
00:54:05,618 --> 00:54:08,246
...and thrown across the lawn
by one of my children.

457
00:54:10,373 --> 00:54:12,375
I just wanted to point that out
to you to show...

458
00:54:12,542 --> 00:54:14,794
...that we're not all "polished brass"
about these things.

459
00:54:14,961 --> 00:54:17,922
And also point out that last year...

460
00:54:18,089 --> 00:54:21,134
...Americans shot more
than 7 billion photographs...

461
00:54:21,301 --> 00:54:26,389
...at a record of 6.6 billion dollars
for film equipment and processing.

462
00:54:26,556 --> 00:54:28,433
Now, with all those shutters clicking...

463
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:31,436
...where is the indisputable
photographic evidence?

464
00:54:31,603 --> 00:54:35,023
Major Benchley, I've been
in the news business for a long time...

465
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:37,525
...and our cameras have never been able
to take a picture...

466
00:54:37,692 --> 00:54:39,152
...of a plane crash as it happened...

467
00:54:39,319 --> 00:54:42,071
...or an automobile accident
and get it on the 6:00 news.

468
00:54:42,238 --> 00:54:43,448
That's right. That's right.

469
00:54:46,826 --> 00:54:48,536
Folks....

470
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:54,667
There are all kinds of ideas
that would be fun to believe in.

471
00:54:54,834 --> 00:54:56,544
Mental telepathy...

472
00:54:56,711 --> 00:54:58,254
...time travel...

473
00:54:58,630 --> 00:55:00,298
...immortality...

474
00:55:00,924 --> 00:55:02,800
...even Santa Claus.

475
00:55:03,426 --> 00:55:07,639
I know it's no fun to go home and say,
"Guess what happened today.

476
00:55:07,805 --> 00:55:11,559
I was in the shopping center,
there was this tremendously bright light...

477
00:55:11,726 --> 00:55:14,312
...and I rushed outside...

478
00:55:14,896 --> 00:55:16,231
...and it was an airplane."

479
00:55:16,397 --> 00:55:19,400
Excuse me, sir. I didn't want to see this.

480
00:55:20,735 --> 00:55:22,070
I sure wish I had.

481
00:55:22,237 --> 00:55:24,239
You know,
for 15 years I've been looking...

482
00:55:24,405 --> 00:55:27,450
...for these damn silly lights
in the night sky.

483
00:55:27,951 --> 00:55:29,369
I've never found any.

484
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:32,455
I'd like to,
because I believe in life elsewhere.

485
00:55:32,914 --> 00:55:34,249
Why don't you admit...

486
00:55:34,415 --> 00:55:38,211
...that the Air Force is conducting
secret tests in the Foothills area?

487
00:55:38,378 --> 00:55:41,214
It would be easy to say yes to that.

488
00:55:41,756 --> 00:55:45,677
But I'm not going to mislead you.
This is not the case.

489
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:48,054
To tell you the truth,
I don't know what you saw.

490
00:55:48,221 --> 00:55:52,100
You can't fool us by agreeing with us.
No, no, no. Hey, come on!

491
00:55:52,642 --> 00:55:54,560
I saw Bigfoot once.

492
00:55:59,357 --> 00:56:03,611
1951. Back in Sequoia National Park.

493
00:56:03,778 --> 00:56:08,074
Had a foot on her, 37 inches. Heel to toe.

494
00:56:08,241 --> 00:56:09,826
Wow.

495
00:56:11,953 --> 00:56:15,456
Made a sound I would not want
to hear twice in my life.

496
00:56:20,295 --> 00:56:23,214
I believe I've encountered
that gentleman myself.

497
00:56:24,215 --> 00:56:27,051
I was sitting on the porch
one night, looking through the screen.

498
00:56:27,218 --> 00:56:29,595
I seen this big white dot in the sky.

499
00:56:29,762 --> 00:56:32,140
It turned red and blue and green.

500
00:56:32,307 --> 00:56:36,644
Further it got away, it just kept pulsating
more and more and more.

501
00:56:36,811 --> 00:56:41,441
UFOs do not represent
a direct physical threat to national security.

502
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:46,529
We do not support them,
and we encourage you not to.

503
00:57:25,151 --> 00:57:27,320
Let's get in touch with
those Forest Service people...

504
00:57:27,528 --> 00:57:31,240
...or we're gonna end up in
a wilderness area with vehicular traffic.

505
00:57:31,616 --> 00:57:35,411
And that's strictly sacred-cow stuff
to those folks in Wyoming.

506
00:57:41,834 --> 00:57:44,379
If this mission fully develops...

507
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:50,301
...I get white-knuckled just thinking about
what might be ahead for those folks.

508
00:57:51,427 --> 00:57:53,262
Your flight will be at 2000 hours.

509
00:57:53,471 --> 00:57:57,141
We have a limo that'll take you
to the heliport now.

510
00:57:57,683 --> 00:58:00,269
And, of course, the transportation
will be provided on the other end.

511
00:58:02,814 --> 00:58:06,359
- Look. I still like the flash-flood idea.
- Where are you gonna get the water?

512
00:58:06,526 --> 00:58:08,194
We've had about two inches of rain--

513
00:58:08,361 --> 00:58:11,989
We can survey dams and reservoirs,
tell them one's gonna burst.

514
00:58:12,156 --> 00:58:14,784
And besides that, there's not
enough water in those reservoirs!

515
00:58:14,992 --> 00:58:18,329
Wait! Contaminated water
affects people, crops, animals.

516
00:58:18,579 --> 00:58:19,747
Disease.

517
00:58:19,956 --> 00:58:22,625
- Yeah, epidemic.
- What kind of disease?

518
00:58:22,875 --> 00:58:23,918
Plague. A plague epidemic.

519
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:26,254
Nobody's gonna believe a plague
in this day and age.

520
00:58:26,879 --> 00:58:28,256
- Anthrax.
- Ranching country.

521
00:58:28,423 --> 00:58:31,384
- Yes.
- There are a lot of sheep in the hills.

522
00:58:31,592 --> 00:58:32,844
That's good. That's good, I like that.

523
00:58:33,052 --> 00:58:36,097
- It'll create a panic.
- But it may not evacuate everybody.

524
00:58:36,347 --> 00:58:39,267
There's always some joker
who thinks he's immune.

525
00:58:41,310 --> 00:58:45,481
What I need is something so scary
it'll clear 300 square miles...

526
00:58:45,690 --> 00:58:48,568
...of every living Christian soul.

527
00:59:19,182 --> 00:59:23,019
- Toby!
- I'm gonna hit you across the street...

528
00:59:23,186 --> 00:59:25,104
- ...tomorrow night!
- Ride your bike--

529
00:59:25,271 --> 00:59:27,106
- You are not!
- Boys.

530
00:59:27,273 --> 00:59:30,818
Toby. Did you finish
your science project?

531
00:59:43,372 --> 00:59:45,124
Aah.

532
00:59:45,291 --> 00:59:47,043
Toby.

533
00:59:47,251 --> 00:59:51,130
- I don't want any potatoes.
- Yeah, just a little bit.

534
00:59:58,888 --> 01:00:00,056
Help yourself.

535
01:00:03,643 --> 01:00:08,147
I hate these potatoes.
There's a dead fly in my potatoes.

536
01:00:08,356 --> 01:00:09,649
It's okay.

537
01:01:56,088 --> 01:01:58,049
Well, I guess you've noticed...

538
01:01:58,841 --> 01:02:03,346
...something is a little strange with Dad.

539
01:02:06,557 --> 01:02:08,309
It's okay, though.

540
01:02:10,603 --> 01:02:12,271
I'm still Dad.

541
01:02:17,318 --> 01:02:21,364
I can't describe it, what I'm feeling...

542
01:02:21,614 --> 01:02:23,949
...and what I'm thinking.

543
01:02:26,577 --> 01:02:28,788
This means something.

544
01:02:30,039 --> 01:02:32,333
This is important.

545
01:02:43,469 --> 01:02:44,887
That's not right.

546
01:02:49,058 --> 01:02:50,559
It's not right.

547
01:02:52,686 --> 01:02:54,480
That's not right.

548
01:03:13,124 --> 01:03:15,709
That's not right!

549
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,593
What is it?

550
01:03:26,137 --> 01:03:28,472
What is it?!

551
01:03:35,855 --> 01:03:37,606
It's not fair.

552
01:03:43,112 --> 01:03:44,613
Tell me.

553
01:04:18,481 --> 01:04:20,816
<i>Well, what do
you know? It's disintegrated.</i>

554
01:04:24,653 --> 01:04:27,990
<i>Happy birthday,
you thing from another world, you.</i>

555
01:04:28,157 --> 01:04:30,659
<i>Oh, thank you!</i>

556
01:04:37,708 --> 01:04:39,668
<i>Well, I guess he's had enough.</i>

557
01:04:40,961 --> 01:04:42,046
<i>Ha, ha!</i>

558
01:04:42,213 --> 01:04:44,465
Are you going to yell at me?

559
01:05:00,147 --> 01:05:03,150
Ronnie? Everything's fine.

560
01:05:13,244 --> 01:05:15,371
All this stuff is coming down.

561
01:05:20,334 --> 01:05:23,087
It's all gonna be like it was.

562
01:05:31,262 --> 01:05:36,350
<i>That's the last straw!
Now I use my secret weapon!</i>

563
01:06:00,457 --> 01:06:02,584
Ooh! Ow.

564
01:06:05,671 --> 01:06:07,006
Roy?

565
01:06:07,631 --> 01:06:11,343
Roy, I'm sorry about last night. Roy!

566
01:06:12,845 --> 01:06:16,640
Roy. Roy, what are you doing?

567
01:06:17,641 --> 01:06:19,143
Jesus.

568
01:06:24,398 --> 01:06:27,026
Roy. Roy.

569
01:06:28,485 --> 01:06:29,778
The plants are fine there!

570
01:06:31,196 --> 01:06:32,364
Roy, can you hear me?

571
01:06:33,073 --> 01:06:34,283
Wait!

572
01:06:34,450 --> 01:06:36,493
What are you--? What are you doing?

573
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:37,870
You're gonna love it, Ronnie!

574
01:06:38,037 --> 01:06:40,497
- What do you mean?
- You'll really love this.

575
01:06:40,664 --> 01:06:43,375
Roy, what are you doing?

576
01:06:43,834 --> 01:06:45,878
Oh. My--

577
01:06:48,839 --> 01:06:50,466
Oh, Roy!

578
01:06:50,632 --> 01:06:52,384
Aah! My God!

579
01:06:54,053 --> 01:06:55,512
Come on, men!

580
01:06:57,014 --> 01:07:01,226
Dad, after this,
can we throw dirt in my window?

581
01:07:04,813 --> 01:07:06,148
Stop it.

582
01:07:07,399 --> 01:07:09,151
Stop. Stop it.

583
01:07:09,318 --> 01:07:10,778
Ronnie...

584
01:07:11,403 --> 01:07:15,741
...if I don't do this,
that's when I'm gonna need a doctor.

585
01:07:19,161 --> 01:07:20,454
What are you doing?

586
01:07:20,621 --> 01:07:22,373
- I got it.
- What are you doing?

587
01:07:22,539 --> 01:07:24,208
I figured it out, that's all.

588
01:07:24,375 --> 01:07:26,085
- Will you just listen?
- No.

589
01:07:26,251 --> 01:07:28,629
Ronnie, look, you ever look
at something when it's crazy...

590
01:07:28,796 --> 01:07:31,173
...and then you look at it in another way
and it's not crazy?

591
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:32,424
No, I haven't. No.

592
01:07:32,591 --> 01:07:34,676
Come on, Ronnie. Just listen.

593
01:07:34,843 --> 01:07:37,179
- I don't know what you're doing.
- Just close your eyes.

594
01:07:37,346 --> 01:07:40,599
Close your eyes and hold your breath,
everything will be really pretty.

595
01:07:40,766 --> 01:07:43,102
Roy, you're scaring us now.

596
01:07:43,268 --> 01:07:46,397
Don't be scared.
Just don't be scared. I feel really good.

597
01:07:46,563 --> 01:07:48,399
Everything's gonna be all right.

598
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:50,734
I haven't felt this good in years.

599
01:07:50,901 --> 01:07:53,112
Everything's gonna be okay. I can feel it.

600
01:07:56,490 --> 01:07:59,326
- Now what else? What else?
- Like this? Like this?

601
01:08:00,619 --> 01:08:01,870
Right.

602
01:08:40,868 --> 01:08:42,161
Like this?

603
01:08:45,038 --> 01:08:46,415
Chicken wire.

604
01:08:56,758 --> 01:08:58,969
Whatever you're doing,
it's against the law!

605
01:08:59,136 --> 01:09:00,846
He's putting it back, Mrs. Harris.

606
01:09:01,013 --> 01:09:02,097
I'll pay you for this.

607
01:09:02,264 --> 01:09:03,348
Take it. Take it.

608
01:09:03,515 --> 01:09:05,350
I'm perfectly fine.

609
01:09:05,517 --> 01:09:07,686
You let go of this fence right now.
You come with me.

610
01:09:07,853 --> 01:09:10,772
Do you want me to hit you?
You let go of that fence!

611
01:09:10,939 --> 01:09:13,358
Toby! Listen to me. Listen to me.

612
01:09:13,525 --> 01:09:15,277
Please. Come on, right now.
We're going.

613
01:09:15,444 --> 01:09:18,614
- I want to stay here!
- Let go of the fence! Come on.

614
01:09:36,882 --> 01:09:39,009
Stay! Stay.

615
01:09:42,971 --> 01:09:45,390
- Where are we going?
- Where are we going?

616
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:47,309
- Where are we going?
- Just get in the car.

617
01:09:47,476 --> 01:09:50,437
- Where are we going?
- Quietly, quickly, get in.

618
01:09:50,854 --> 01:09:52,064
Get in there, Toby.

619
01:09:52,523 --> 01:09:53,565
Quickly.

620
01:09:56,693 --> 01:09:59,196
- Dad needs some more help!
- Lock the doors! Lock the doors!

621
01:09:59,363 --> 01:10:00,697
Dad needs some more help!

622
01:10:00,906 --> 01:10:04,409
Quiet! Just lock the doors.
Roll up those windows.

623
01:10:04,618 --> 01:10:07,162
Yes, he does!
Dad needs some more help!

624
01:10:07,371 --> 01:10:08,956
Honey, where you going?

625
01:10:09,164 --> 01:10:10,499
- What?
- Where are you going?

626
01:10:11,959 --> 01:10:14,294
Taking the kids to my sister's.

627
01:10:15,754 --> 01:10:17,339
That's crazy. You're not even dressed.

628
01:10:19,091 --> 01:10:20,175
What?

629
01:10:20,551 --> 01:10:21,927
You said what?

630
01:10:26,932 --> 01:10:28,600
Ronnie, wait!

631
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:30,852
Ronnie, hold it.

632
01:10:31,144 --> 01:10:33,772
Would you hold--?
Would you hold it one minute?

633
01:11:01,008 --> 01:11:02,134
Morning.

634
01:11:41,632 --> 01:11:44,801
<i>What is wrong with me today?</i>

635
01:11:50,891 --> 01:11:52,142
<i>Who is it, please?</i>

636
01:11:52,517 --> 01:11:53,769
<i>It's the mailman.</i>

637
01:11:53,935 --> 01:11:56,772
<i>There's a package for Julie Anderson.</i>

638
01:11:59,858 --> 01:12:02,903
<i>You can just leave it at the door!</i>

639
01:12:03,945 --> 01:12:08,909
<i>Ha-ha-ha. I can't do that. I'm
supposed to C.O.D. Mm-hm, like that.</i>

640
01:12:09,117 --> 01:12:10,452
<i>And besides...</i>

641
01:12:11,411 --> 01:12:13,872
<i>...you and I have to have a little talk...</i>

642
01:12:14,873 --> 01:12:16,208
<i>...about Kim.</i>

643
01:12:36,019 --> 01:12:38,897
<i>Like sands through the hourglass...</i>

644
01:12:39,147 --> 01:12:42,109

<i>Good evening. At the top of the news
tonight, a rail disaster.</i>

653
01:13:18,395 --> 01:13:20,272
<i>At Devils Tower, Wyoming...</i>

654
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:23,942
<i>...a train loaded with a dangerous
chemical gas went off the rails...</i>

655
01:13:24,151 --> 01:13:26,778
<i>...and has forced
the widest area evacuation...</i>

656
01:13:26,987 --> 01:13:30,240
<i>...in the history of these controversial
Army rail shipments.</i>

657
01:13:30,449 --> 01:13:33,785
Whenever you want me to.
Tomorrow is fine.

658
01:13:35,745 --> 01:13:37,873
I can do other things.

659
01:13:38,582 --> 01:13:40,834
I'm trying to be.

660
01:13:42,169 --> 01:13:43,211
Yes, I am.

661
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:46,381
<i>The Army and National
Guard are supervising the evacuation.</i>

662
01:13:46,798 --> 01:13:51,261
I am an adult, okay?
Even though there's no such thing.

663
01:13:51,470 --> 01:13:53,096
It was a joke!

664
01:13:53,305 --> 01:13:56,057
<i>--the danger will be over
within 72 hours.</i>

665
01:13:56,516 --> 01:13:59,519
Ronnie, anything you want.

666
01:13:59,853 --> 01:14:02,481
Anything you want, I'll do.

667
01:14:05,442 --> 01:14:06,943
For how long?

668
01:14:12,699 --> 01:14:14,576
All of you?

669
01:14:15,911 --> 01:14:20,457
No. Ronnie,
I wanna talk about this in person.

670
01:14:21,541 --> 01:14:26,338
This is not-- We can't talk about this
on the telephone. All ri--

671
01:14:26,505 --> 01:14:29,132
Ronnie! Don't hang up! Just don't--

672
01:14:29,299 --> 01:14:31,426
<i>--meat should remain unaffected.</i>

673
01:14:31,593 --> 01:14:35,430
<i>This means
order your steak well-done, Walter.</i>

674
01:14:35,597 --> 01:14:38,767
<i>Devils Tower, Wyoming
was the first national monument...</i>

675
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:41,228
<i>...erected in this country
by Theodore Roosevelt in 1915.</i>

676
01:14:42,979 --> 01:14:46,483
<i>Thousands of
civilian refugees are fleeing the area...</i>

677
01:14:46,691 --> 01:14:50,153
<i>...spurred on by rumors that the seven
tanker cars that overturned...</i>

678
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:54,866
<i>...at Walkashi Needles Junction were
filled to capacity with GM nerve gas.</i>

679
01:14:55,033 --> 01:14:56,701
<i>In just a few minutes,
we're going to be--</i>

680
01:14:56,910 --> 01:15:00,455
<i>--boasts 400,000 vacationers.</i>

681
01:15:00,622 --> 01:15:03,333
<i>And fortunately, during this mishap
there have been no fatalities.</i>

682
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:06,086
--<i>forced to evacuate
this area, which in a few minutes...</i>

683
01:15:06,336 --> 01:15:10,006
<i>... will become known as the "hot zone, "
depending on the prevailing winds.</i>

684
01:15:10,257 --> 01:15:14,010
<i>But as it is, this is as close to the disaster
as we've been allowed to get.</i>

685
01:15:14,261 --> 01:15:16,930
--<i>due to a strong
prevailing north-south wind.</i>

686
01:15:17,138 --> 01:15:19,933
<i>Army chemical engineers
and the Wyoming National Guard...</i>

687
01:15:20,141 --> 01:15:23,645
<i>...are making every effort to both
contain the leaking toxins...</i>

688
01:15:23,895 --> 01:15:27,023
<i>...and evacuate an area
of almost 200 square miles.</i>

689
01:15:27,232 --> 01:15:30,610
<i>Everyone is being warned:
Stay out of the area.</i>

690
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:33,697
<i>Everyone, please, stay out of the area.</i>

691
01:15:33,905 --> 01:15:36,241
<i>--and thousands of others are homeless.</i>

692
01:15:36,408 --> 01:15:40,704
<i>U.S. Army Materiel Command
has issued these new area restrictions:</i>

693
01:15:40,954 --> 01:15:43,081
<i>All roadways north of Crowheart
on Interstate 25.</i>

694
01:15:43,248 --> 01:15:44,374
Shit.

695
01:15:44,541 --> 01:15:47,919
<i>All roads leading into the Grand Tetons
west of Meeteeste.</i>

696
01:15:48,128 --> 01:15:51,047
<i>All multilane

<i>...railroad, local and historic stage roads
south of Cody.</i>

698
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:07,981
Why aren't there any fat lines
instead of these thin ones?

699
01:16:09,983 --> 01:16:11,359
Yo!

700
01:16:12,944 --> 01:16:15,280
- Holy mother of--
- You're going the wrong way!

701
01:16:15,614 --> 01:16:20,160
Yo! Turn back around. Back this way.

702
01:16:20,785 --> 01:16:22,329
Hey, what's the matter with you?

703
01:16:22,621 --> 01:16:24,164
Yes, sir. Sorry, officer.

704
01:16:24,414 --> 01:16:27,250
It's just a rental, officer. Just a rental.

705
01:16:28,043 --> 01:16:29,377
My fault! My fault!

706
01:16:29,628 --> 01:16:31,921
Starting with the letter "F," as in "Frank"...

707
01:16:32,172 --> 01:16:34,341
...to the letter "J," as in "Jack"...

708
01:16:34,549 --> 01:16:38,178
...please find your way to the loading
platform for immediate boarding.

709
01:16:41,056 --> 01:16:44,392
Step right up. All right, folks,
I don't want to alarm you...

710
01:16:44,559 --> 01:16:48,188
...but this nerve gas
is odorless and colorless.

711
01:16:49,105 --> 01:16:54,486
The first symptom that you're gonna see
is gonna be a dilation of your eyeball.

712
01:17:01,618 --> 01:17:04,704
So now I'm gonna tell you,
these canary birds are guaranteed...

713
01:17:04,871 --> 01:17:09,250
...to fall off of their perch one hour before
the gas does anything to you.

714
01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:25,225
--last names starting
with the letter "K" to "P"' as in "Peter."

715
01:17:25,392 --> 01:17:26,976
All aboard, please.

716
01:17:27,143 --> 01:17:29,688
You got next-of-kin
in the red zone, buddy?

717
01:17:29,854 --> 01:17:31,690
Uh-huh. My sister.

718
01:17:31,856 --> 01:17:33,817
- What's her name?
- Well, that's okay.

719
01:17:33,983 --> 01:17:36,111
She's probably out of there
by now already.

720
01:17:36,277 --> 01:17:38,697
We got everybody out of here
before noon yesterday.

721
01:17:38,863 --> 01:17:40,740
Tell me her name and I'll tell you
where she's relocated.

722
01:17:40,907 --> 01:17:42,617
That's okay, I can find her myself.

723
01:17:42,784 --> 01:17:46,496
Man, there's more than
20 evacuation stations across the state.

724
01:17:46,663 --> 01:17:48,373
What's your name?

725
01:17:49,249 --> 01:17:52,377
- Smith.
- Smith.

726
01:17:52,544 --> 01:17:56,005
We got orders to shoot anybody
looting around here.

727
01:17:58,133 --> 01:17:59,676
Pass it on, huh?

728
01:18:05,098 --> 01:18:06,975
Roy!

729
01:18:12,188 --> 01:18:15,692
I'm gonna let you buy
two gas masks for the price of one.

730
01:18:15,859 --> 01:18:17,652
- Roy!
- Two birds for the price of one...

731
01:18:17,819 --> 01:18:19,738
...and I hope to see you again!

732
01:18:22,657 --> 01:18:24,826
The train has time to clear the area.

733
01:18:24,993 --> 01:18:29,873
There's no immediate danger
and no need to hurry or push.

734
01:18:30,832 --> 01:18:32,876
Please help each other
by not rushing.

735
01:18:33,042 --> 01:18:35,044
Roy!

736
01:18:41,426 --> 01:18:43,720
Roy!

737
01:18:44,137 --> 01:18:46,055
Roy!

738
01:18:48,766 --> 01:18:50,894
Roy!

739
01:18:54,731 --> 01:18:58,151
I don't care where you go,
just get behind the barricades!

740
01:18:58,902 --> 01:19:01,112
There's no way out!

741
01:19:24,594 --> 01:19:26,346
- What are we doing?
- Look, the only way we're gonna...

742
01:19:26,513 --> 01:19:29,224
...get back in there is to go cross-country.
We gotta break through the fence.

743
01:19:29,432 --> 01:19:31,267
- Then let's go.
- All right, hold on. Hold on.

744
01:19:46,533 --> 01:19:47,825
Watch out!

745
01:19:55,416 --> 01:19:57,752
The police dragged the river for him.

746
01:19:57,961 --> 01:20:00,880
I told them he wasn't in the river.
He wasn't in the river.

747
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:05,802
Then they went around to every house
within five miles...

748
01:20:06,803 --> 01:20:10,890
...looking inside back-yard refrigerators.

749
01:20:14,936 --> 01:20:17,480
They asked me if I'd seen any strangers
in the neighborhood.

750
01:21:26,466 --> 01:21:28,676
I don't believe it's real.

751
01:21:30,803 --> 01:21:32,847
I don't believe it's real.

752
01:21:34,098 --> 01:21:35,558
It's real.

753
01:21:42,148 --> 01:21:45,401
Let's get down there.
Get some gas and get down in there.

754
01:21:48,613 --> 01:21:49,656
What are those?

755
01:22:14,097 --> 01:22:18,267
Look, I guarantee you.
This whole thing is a put-on.

756
01:22:54,053 --> 01:22:55,263
Oh, damn it!

757
01:23:01,227 --> 01:23:03,020
Ma'am, would you please step away....

758
01:23:03,187 --> 01:23:05,064
- This is for your own safety.
- Okay.

759
01:23:05,231 --> 01:23:08,484
All right, one at a time. What do
you want? Get your hands off me!

760
01:23:09,777 --> 01:23:12,196
- How are you feeling?
- I feel fine!

761
01:23:12,905 --> 01:23:16,325
According to my birds, the only bad air
around here is you guys farting around!

762
01:23:27,336 --> 01:23:29,255
- Move them out!
- What's happening?

763
01:23:29,464 --> 01:23:31,799
- Wait. Where are we going?
- All right, go to the van.

764
01:23:31,966 --> 01:23:33,301
Where are you taking her?

765
01:23:33,509 --> 01:23:35,595
Hold it! Why can't we go together?

766
01:23:35,762 --> 01:23:36,804
Watch your step.

767
01:23:37,305 --> 01:23:38,931
Roy.

768
01:23:55,114 --> 01:23:58,117
We have very little time, Mr. Neary.
This is Mr. Lacombe.

769
01:23:58,284 --> 01:24:00,536
- Hello.
- We need answers from you...

770
01:24:00,703 --> 01:24:02,830
...that are honest,
direct and to the point.

771
01:24:03,039 --> 01:24:04,290
Where is Jillian?

772
01:24:06,459 --> 01:24:09,587
Do you realize the danger
that you and your friend have risked?

773
01:24:10,630 --> 01:24:13,925
In coming here,
you've exposed yourself to toxic gas.

774
01:24:14,133 --> 01:24:15,718
Well, I'm alive. We're talk--

775
01:24:15,927 --> 01:24:17,303
We're talking.

776
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:20,348
This is true, Mr. Neary.

777
01:24:21,307 --> 01:24:24,685
But if the prevailing winds were blowing
from the south instead of the north...

778
01:24:26,103 --> 01:24:28,314
...this conversation would
not be taking place.

779
01:24:28,481 --> 01:24:29,857
There's nothing wrong with the air.

780
01:24:31,901 --> 01:24:33,486
What makes you say that?

781
01:24:33,736 --> 01:24:35,988
I just know.
There's nothing wrong with it.

782
01:24:36,531 --> 01:24:38,741
Go outside and make me a liar.

783
01:24:42,411 --> 01:24:45,373
Uh, look, I wanna talk to
the man in charge.

784
01:24:45,581 --> 01:24:47,959
Mr. Lacombe is the highest authority.

785
01:24:48,334 --> 01:24:50,169
He isn't even an American.

786
01:24:52,547 --> 01:24:55,508
Mr. Neary,
are you an artist or a painter?

787
01:24:56,676 --> 01:24:57,718
No.

788
01:25:01,347 --> 01:25:04,433
Have you been hearing
a persistent ringing in your ears?

789
01:25:04,642 --> 01:25:06,477
Almost an agreeable ringing?

790
01:25:06,686 --> 01:25:07,728
No.

791
01:25:09,146 --> 01:25:11,315
Having headaches, migraines?

792
01:25:11,816 --> 01:25:12,900
Yeah.

793
01:25:14,151 --> 01:25:16,195
An irritation in your eyes
and your sinuses?

794
01:25:16,445 --> 01:25:17,572
Yeah.

795
01:25:18,698 --> 01:25:21,909
Do you have hives?
Do you have allergies?

796
01:25:23,995 --> 01:25:26,247
And burning on your face
and on your body?

797
01:25:26,455 --> 01:25:29,041
- Yes. Who are you people?
- Look at this.

798
01:25:29,292 --> 01:25:32,295
Yeah, I got one just like it
in my living room. Who are you people?

799
01:25:38,175 --> 01:25:40,636
Monsieur Neary, please,
one more question.

800
01:25:42,597 --> 01:25:45,016
Have you recently had
a close encounter?

801
01:25:46,183 --> 01:25:49,270
A close encounter with
something very unusual?

802
01:25:52,189 --> 01:25:54,150
Who are you people?

803
01:26:00,865 --> 01:26:02,950
These people strangers to you?

804
01:26:03,117 --> 01:26:04,827
Yeah. Except for her.

805
01:26:07,038 --> 01:26:09,874
And the two of you
felt compelled to be here?

806
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,877
Yeah, you might say that.

807
01:26:13,377 --> 01:26:14,837
But what did you expect to find?

808
01:26:15,046 --> 01:26:16,631
An answer.

809
01:26:18,257 --> 01:26:20,176
That's not crazy, is it?

810
01:26:36,442 --> 01:26:39,445
Ho, ho, ho.
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

811
01:26:39,695 --> 01:26:40,863
Is that it?

812
01:26:41,864 --> 01:26:44,283
Is that all you're gonna ask me?

813
01:26:45,201 --> 01:26:47,703
Well, I got a couple of thousand
goddamn questions, you know?

814
01:26:47,912 --> 01:26:52,124
I wanna speak to someone in charge.
I wanna lodge a complaint.

815
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:54,794
You have no right
to make people crazy.

816
01:26:55,002 --> 01:26:59,215
You think I investigate every
Walter Cronkite story there is? Huh?

817
01:26:59,632 --> 01:27:03,302
If this is just nerve gas, how come
I know everything in such detail?

818
01:27:03,511 --> 01:27:05,262
I've never been here before.

819
01:27:06,222 --> 01:27:08,140
How come I know so much?

820
01:27:08,432 --> 01:27:10,351
What the hell is going on
around here?!

821
01:27:10,559 --> 01:27:12,603
Who the hell are you people?!

822
01:27:37,461 --> 01:27:39,547
Is that it?! Answer me!

823
01:27:40,256 --> 01:27:43,676
I didn't come this far
to get taken on any bus ride home!

824
01:28:06,282 --> 01:28:08,367
Five minutes. Five!

825
01:28:09,035 --> 01:28:11,245
We're gonna hold
for a couple of minutes.

826
01:28:45,196 --> 01:28:48,532
You brought in 12 people
to the decontamination camp...

827
01:28:48,741 --> 01:28:51,911
...instead of the evacuation center
where they belong. I'd like to know why.

828
01:28:53,496 --> 01:28:56,082
- Because this means something.
- Because this means something.

829
01:28:58,084 --> 01:29:01,337
These people have come
from all over their country...

830
01:29:03,089 --> 01:29:06,509
...to a place they have been told
will endanger their lives.

831
01:29:06,717 --> 01:29:07,843
- Why?
- Why?

832
01:29:08,094 --> 01:29:11,806
Well, because somebody could be trying
to subvert this whole operation...

833
01:29:12,056 --> 01:29:15,518
...by sending in fanatics and cultists
and Christ knows what all.

834
01:29:15,768 --> 01:29:17,853
- Robert.
- Yes.

835
01:29:18,771 --> 01:29:20,940
Thank you very much.

836
01:29:23,109 --> 01:29:25,569
This is a small group of people...

837
01:29:27,029 --> 01:29:30,282
...who have shared a vision in common.

838
01:29:30,908 --> 01:29:32,076
Look.

839
01:29:35,204 --> 01:29:38,290
It's still a mystery to me
why they are here.

840
01:29:38,541 --> 01:29:40,543
Even they do not know why.

841
01:29:59,186 --> 01:30:00,938
Jillian!

842
01:30:02,022 --> 01:30:03,983
- Jillian.
- Don't! You'll be poisoned!

843
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:07,653
Listen, there's nothing wrong
with the air around here.

844
01:30:07,862 --> 01:30:11,866
The Army's getting us out of here
because they don't want any witnesses.

845
01:30:12,533 --> 01:30:15,870
But if the Army doesn't want us here,
then it's none of our business.

846
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:19,665
We only wanted to see the mountain.
It was such a coincidence I painted it.

847
01:30:19,915 --> 01:30:21,500
You can take it off!

848
01:30:21,709 --> 01:30:25,296
The air here is better
than it is in Los Angeles. Ha, ha!

849
01:30:25,462 --> 01:30:29,258
Listen, listen. How many of you people
are for getting out of here?

850
01:30:34,805 --> 01:30:38,309
I don't know what's happening
either. And I must find out what's going on.

851
01:30:43,063 --> 01:30:47,776
For every one of these anxious people
who have come here this evening...

852
01:30:50,279 --> 01:30:55,034
...there must be hundreds also touched
by the vision who never made it this far.

853
01:30:56,035 --> 01:30:58,954
Simply because they
never watch the television.

854
01:31:00,623 --> 01:31:03,918
Or perhaps they watched it,
but never made the psychic connection.

855
01:31:04,168 --> 01:31:07,963
It's a coincidence. It's not scientific.

856
01:31:10,466 --> 01:31:12,384
Listen to me, Major Walsh...

857
01:31:12,593 --> 01:31:15,137
...it is an event sociological.

858
01:31:20,392 --> 01:31:21,727
Go for the mountain!

859
01:31:21,894 --> 01:31:24,396
Careful, everybody. Don't hurt yourself.

860
01:31:45,459 --> 01:31:47,670
Hey! Wait a minute!

861
01:32:03,644 --> 01:32:05,604
- My name's Neary!
- Larry Butler!

862
01:32:05,771 --> 01:32:07,731
- How are you doing?
- I'm doing okay! How are you?

863
01:32:07,898 --> 01:32:09,650
- Fine, fine!
- That's good!

864
01:32:10,275 --> 01:32:12,236
Everybody keep their masks on...

865
01:32:12,403 --> 01:32:14,738
...until you're out of here
and out of danger.

866
01:32:14,947 --> 01:32:19,159
Listen, we wanna get out of here!
What's the matter with you?

867
01:32:34,508 --> 01:32:37,177
<i>Major Walsh, Major Walsh.</i>

868
01:32:37,344 --> 01:32:40,514
Yes, sir. I'll have the rest of them
off the mountain in one hour.

869
01:32:40,723 --> 01:32:43,475
<i>Major, I want you to use infrared...</i>

870
01:32:43,684 --> 01:32:46,228
<i>...and get me a photo analysis
of the northern face.</i>

871
01:32:46,437 --> 01:32:48,480
Yes, sir, it's already been ordered.

872
01:32:48,731 --> 01:32:50,774
<i>Major Walsh, listen.</i>

873
01:32:50,983 --> 01:32:54,528
<i>I don't like to do this. We're in enough
trouble with these cattlemen already.</i>

874
01:32:54,778 --> 01:32:58,657
<i>If you can't get them off the mountain
and out of the area by 2000 hours...</i>

875
01:32:58,907 --> 01:33:01,201
<i>...start dusting with EZ-4.</i>

876
01:33:01,869 --> 01:33:03,078
What's EZ-4?

877
01:33:03,328 --> 01:33:06,707
It's a sleep aerosol. Same stuff
that we used with the livestock.

878
01:33:06,915 --> 01:33:08,375
Comes out of Riot Control.

879
01:33:08,584 --> 01:33:12,504
They'll sleep for six hours and wake up
with a hell of a headache, that's all.

880
01:33:12,713 --> 01:33:16,425
We didn't choose this place.
We didn't choose these people!

881
01:33:16,675 --> 01:33:18,761
They were invited!

882
01:33:24,808 --> 01:33:27,102
They belong here more than we.

883
01:33:34,902 --> 01:33:36,570
I should have never given up jogging.

884
01:33:36,779 --> 01:33:38,572
See that notch
in the corner of the mountain?

885
01:33:38,739 --> 01:33:40,157
We can make that one in no time.

886
01:33:40,365 --> 01:33:41,950
Here come three more.

887
01:33:44,912 --> 01:33:46,872
<i>The authority in this park...</i>

888
01:33:47,081 --> 01:33:50,667
<i>...has been superseded by
the United States government.</i>

889
01:33:50,834 --> 01:33:53,545
There's a ravine leading straight up.
I remember it from my painting.

890
01:33:53,712 --> 01:33:55,672
It's an easier climb. It faces northeast.

891
01:33:55,839 --> 01:34:00,469
It's no good. At the top, there's a 300-foot
drop straight down. Get down!

892
01:34:00,677 --> 01:34:03,263
What do you think
is down on the other side?

893
01:34:03,972 --> 01:34:07,101
There's a box canyon on the other side
with ravines and trails...

894
01:34:07,309 --> 01:34:09,520
...if you take this gradual incline
to the right.

895
01:34:09,728 --> 01:34:12,523
I never imagined that.
In my painting, I only painted one side.

896
01:34:12,731 --> 01:34:14,399
There was no canyon
in the doodles I made.

897
01:34:14,566 --> 01:34:15,651
Next time, try sculpturing.

898
01:34:15,859 --> 01:34:18,779
You've given us a hell of a lot of credit.
That's a good hour's climb.

899
01:34:18,987 --> 01:34:20,155
Come on, let's go.

900
01:34:25,702 --> 01:34:28,288
<i>The authority in this park...</i>

901
01:34:28,497 --> 01:34:32,793
<i>...has been superseded by
the United States government.</i>

902
01:34:33,001 --> 01:34:37,548
<i>You are entering
a military reservation...</i>

903
01:34:37,798 --> 01:34:40,467
<i>...and subject to military law.</i>

904
01:34:40,676 --> 01:34:42,261
Call the bastard.

905
01:34:46,140 --> 01:34:48,142
Bahama, this is Pyramid. Over.

906
01:34:48,392 --> 01:34:49,560
<i>Go ahead.</i>

907
01:34:49,768 --> 01:34:52,104
Nothing to report at midstation.

908
01:34:52,312 --> 01:34:55,190
Up ahead
there's thousands of places to hide.

909
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:59,403
We're gonna need at least three times
the men to cover this in one hour.

910
01:34:59,695 --> 01:35:02,865
<i>Get everybody off the northern face,
then call the dark side of the moon...</i>

911
01:35:03,115 --> 01:35:04,825
<i>...and tell them we're gonna dust.</i>

912
01:35:31,602 --> 01:35:32,978
Get down!

913
01:35:33,979 --> 01:35:36,773
<i>You are entering a military reservation...</i>

914
01:35:37,024 --> 01:35:40,611
<i>...and subject to military law.</i>

915
01:36:10,224 --> 01:36:13,143
Larry! Larry, come on!

916
01:36:30,661 --> 01:36:33,830
Larry! Don't let them see you!
Get down!

917
01:37:09,658 --> 01:37:13,578
They're just crop-dusting. Los Angeles!

918
01:37:17,666 --> 01:37:20,502
- Larry?
- Don't stop!

919
01:37:21,086 --> 01:37:23,005
Don't look back! Come on, come on!

920
01:37:45,819 --> 01:37:48,113
Oh! Roy!

921
01:37:54,411 --> 01:37:57,205
Hurry! We're only 10 feet from the top.

922
01:37:57,456 --> 01:38:00,459
Just a few more feet!
We can slide down the other side!

923
01:38:07,799 --> 01:38:10,302
Come on, hurry. I'll come down.

924
01:38:10,469 --> 01:38:11,511
Don't come down.

925
01:38:12,554 --> 01:38:14,264
Come on, come on. Come on!

926
01:38:14,473 --> 01:38:16,600
- Don't worry. We're gonna make it.
- Roy.

927
01:38:16,767 --> 01:38:18,894
Come on. Come on.
Move it. Move your ass!

928
01:38:19,144 --> 01:38:20,562
Come on.

929
01:38:25,233 --> 01:38:28,945
Roy, come on.
Come on. Please, come on.

930
01:38:30,072 --> 01:38:31,198
Hurry!

931
01:38:33,450 --> 01:38:34,618
Hold it!

932
01:38:38,705 --> 01:38:39,915
Jump! Jump!

933
01:38:52,886 --> 01:38:55,931
- Do you see that?
- Oh, yes.

934
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:57,849
Good.

935
01:38:58,767 --> 01:39:00,060
Is it on?

936
01:39:00,227 --> 01:39:01,395
Check the speaker system here.

937
01:39:01,561 --> 01:39:04,356
I want this up all the way.
Is this one live?

938
01:39:06,733 --> 01:39:08,276
Are you reading me on this one?

939
01:39:09,069 --> 01:39:10,362
How about here?

940
01:39:12,614 --> 01:39:16,868
- Testing. Testing.
- Okay, one, two, three, four.

941
01:39:17,786 --> 01:39:19,538
Testing. Testing.

942
01:39:19,746 --> 01:39:22,874
One, two, three, testing.

943
01:39:30,132 --> 01:39:34,010
Gentlemen, ladies.
Take your positions, please.

944
01:39:35,220 --> 01:39:37,180
This is not a drill.

945
01:39:37,389 --> 01:39:40,892
I repeat, this is not a drill.

946
01:39:41,893 --> 01:39:45,564
Could we have the lights in
the arena down 60 percent, please?

947
01:39:45,981 --> 01:39:47,649
Sixty percent.

948
01:39:51,987 --> 01:39:55,782
I don't think we could ask for
a more beautiful evening, do you?

949
01:40:04,624 --> 01:40:07,002
Okay, watch the skies, please.

950
01:40:07,711 --> 01:40:12,674
We now show uncorrelated targets
approaching from the north-northwest.

951
01:41:02,641 --> 01:41:05,727
We're the only ones
who know. The only ones.

952
01:41:15,362 --> 01:41:16,988
You see that?

953
01:41:18,990 --> 01:41:20,158
Yes.

954
01:41:20,951 --> 01:41:21,993
Good.

955
01:42:10,375 --> 01:42:14,879
All ground personnel
not D-class approved...

956
01:42:15,088 --> 01:42:18,925
...please evacuate
the center approach marker.

957
01:42:19,551 --> 01:42:24,014
Audio analysis personnel,
behind the double yellow line.

958
01:42:29,978 --> 01:42:32,522
ITC, stereo, time and resistance.

959
01:42:33,148 --> 01:42:34,566
Auto ready?

960
01:42:35,233 --> 01:42:38,069
- Tone interpolation on interlock.
- Altitude and tabling now.

961
01:42:38,236 --> 01:42:40,238
ARP and interlock now.

962
01:42:40,780 --> 01:42:43,283
Speed set at seven and a half.

963
01:42:43,533 --> 01:42:46,745
All positive functions, standing by.

964
01:42:53,251 --> 01:42:57,547
Special ARP teams
tagged C, "Captain," F, "Frank"...

965
01:42:57,714 --> 01:43:00,175
...to the speaking platform.

966
01:43:10,060 --> 01:43:12,437
<i>- Six-two.
- Go ahead.</i>

967
01:43:12,771 --> 01:43:13,938
- Sunset.
- Go.

968
01:43:15,106 --> 01:43:17,692
Okay. Start with the tone.

969
01:43:24,783 --> 01:43:25,950
- Tang.
- Go.

970
01:43:26,951 --> 01:43:28,495
Up a full tone.

971
01:43:31,956 --> 01:43:33,792
Down a major third.

972
01:43:34,125 --> 01:43:36,002
Now drop an octave.

973
01:43:41,132 --> 01:43:42,342
- Cool blue.
- Go.

974
01:43:42,550 --> 01:43:44,219
Up a perfect fifth.

975
01:43:47,097 --> 01:43:49,015
Nothing. Nothing at all.

976
01:43:53,561 --> 01:43:54,646
Give me a tone.

977
01:43:56,064 --> 01:43:57,816
- "Re" to the second.
- Up a full tone.

978
01:43:58,066 --> 01:43:59,901
- "Mi" to the third.
- Down a major third.

979
01:44:00,110 --> 01:44:02,237
- "Do" to the first.
- Drop an octave.

980
01:44:02,404 --> 01:44:04,114
- "Do" one-half.
- Up a perfect fifth.

981
01:44:04,322 --> 01:44:06,032
"Sol" to the fifth.

982
01:44:22,215 --> 01:44:23,466
I know that.

983
01:44:26,136 --> 01:44:27,429
Faster.

984
01:44:43,027 --> 01:44:44,362
Kick that mule!

985
01:44:48,658 --> 01:44:49,909
Let's go!

986
01:45:31,868 --> 01:45:33,286
I'm very happy tonight.

987
01:45:33,703 --> 01:45:35,455
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

988
01:45:36,206 --> 01:45:39,375
Not a Merle Haggard, but it was great.

989
01:45:59,062 --> 01:46:00,396
Mr. Lacombe?

990
01:46:06,986 --> 01:46:09,572
What is it? What's happening?

991
01:47:05,295 --> 01:47:07,881
Come on. Come on, let's go.

992
01:47:09,507 --> 01:47:10,967
Keep down.

993
01:47:16,806 --> 01:47:18,391
They're talking way over my head.

994
01:48:28,002 --> 01:48:29,921
- Shit.
- Duck, duck!

995
01:49:06,040 --> 01:49:07,333
<i>Photo one.</i>

996
01:49:07,542 --> 01:49:10,962
<i>Fantastic! Keep those reloads coming.</i>

997
01:49:11,129 --> 01:49:12,672
<i>Fantastic!</i>

998
01:49:19,345 --> 01:49:21,472
- You wanna see better?
- I can see fine.

999
01:49:21,681 --> 01:49:24,809
- We can't stay here.
- I can.

1000
01:49:25,727 --> 01:49:29,313
- Why?
- Because Barry's not here.

1001
01:49:30,231 --> 01:49:32,233
I'm just not ready.

1002
01:49:36,029 --> 01:49:38,197
I can't-- I can't stay here.
I've gotta get down there.

1003
01:49:38,406 --> 01:49:39,991
I know.

1004
01:50:13,524 --> 01:50:17,695
This is data control to all personnel.

1005
01:50:18,071 --> 01:50:21,282
We monitor no biologic hazards.

1006
01:50:21,532 --> 01:50:23,868
Range safety clear.

1007
01:51:31,310 --> 01:51:34,063
Oh, my God.

1008
01:52:27,617 --> 01:52:29,785
Oh, my God.

1009
01:52:53,809 --> 01:52:55,102
Holy shit.

1010
01:54:47,131 --> 01:54:49,425
There is a safety-hazard zone...

1011
01:54:49,592 --> 01:54:53,471
...extending 25 meters from the ship.

1012
01:54:53,888 --> 01:54:58,726
Special teams are exempt
and should be aware of low gravity.

1013
01:54:58,976 --> 01:55:03,272
Expect some dizziness,
and look out for a static charge.

1014
01:55:05,733 --> 01:55:09,528
All departments at operational
during this phase...

1015
01:55:09,779 --> 01:55:11,947
...signify by beeping twice.

1016
01:55:12,156 --> 01:55:15,242
If everything's ready here
on the dark side of the moon...

1017
01:55:15,618 --> 01:55:17,244
...play the five tones.

1018
01:56:26,730 --> 01:56:28,899
Give her six quavers, then pause.

1019
01:56:30,526 --> 01:56:31,861
She sent us four quavers...

1020
01:56:32,027 --> 01:56:35,364
...a group of five quavers,
a group of four semiquavers.

1021
01:56:49,753 --> 01:56:52,089
The only thing these phrases
have in common are five signals.

1022
01:56:52,256 --> 01:56:53,799
I hope somebody's taking all this down.

1023
01:56:53,966 --> 01:56:55,551
What are we saying to each other?

1024
01:56:55,718 --> 01:56:58,471
It seems they're trying to teach us
a basic tonal vocabulary.

1025
01:56:58,679 --> 01:57:00,139
It's the first day of school, fellas.

1026
01:57:08,397 --> 01:57:11,400
Take everything from the lady.
Follow her pattern note for note.

1027
01:57:28,250 --> 01:57:30,794
We have a translation interlock
on their audio signal.

1028
01:57:31,003 --> 01:57:33,422
We're taking over
this conversation now.

1029
01:58:35,150 --> 01:58:36,986
Let's go! Come on!

1030
02:00:13,749 --> 02:00:15,584
I am Claude Lacombe.

1031
02:00:18,962 --> 02:00:20,422
Frank Taylor...

1032
02:00:20,631 --> 02:00:23,175
...Lieutenant J.G.,
United States Navy Reserve...

1033
02:00:23,425 --> 02:00:25,302
...064199.

1034
02:00:25,552 --> 02:00:27,805
Lieutenant, welcome home.

1035
02:00:28,263 --> 02:00:30,057
This way to debriefing.

1036
02:00:30,349 --> 02:00:31,433
Harry Ward Craig...

1037
02:00:31,642 --> 02:00:33,811
...Captain, United States Navy...

1038
02:00:33,977 --> 02:00:36,313
...043431.

1039
02:00:36,480 --> 02:00:39,733
Captain, would you come
right this way?

1040
02:00:41,652 --> 02:00:44,113
Welcome back, Navy. Welcome back.

1041
02:00:45,989 --> 02:00:49,159
- Craig, Harry Ward.
- "Captain, United States Navy...

1042
02:00:49,368 --> 02:00:51,412
...0434311."

1043
02:00:51,704 --> 02:00:54,873
Disappeared off Chicken Shoals,
flight 19.

1044
02:00:56,834 --> 02:01:00,546
Matthew McMichael, Lieutenant,
United States Naval Reserve...

1045
02:01:01,130 --> 02:01:03,465
- ...0909411.
- Lieutenant.

1046
02:01:03,674 --> 02:01:05,300
Good to have you back.

1047
02:01:06,301 --> 02:01:08,470
Furlow, Otis B...

1048
02:01:08,721 --> 02:01:11,640
...Lieutenant J.G., United States Navy.

1049
02:01:11,849 --> 02:01:14,977
They haven't even aged.
Einstein was right.

1050
02:01:15,144 --> 02:01:17,312
Einstein was probably one of them.

1051
02:01:17,855 --> 02:01:20,149
Erickson, David A...

1052
02:01:20,315 --> 02:01:23,402
...Lieutenant J.G.,
United States Navy...

1053
02:01:23,694 --> 02:01:27,656
...0639552.

1054
02:01:28,824 --> 02:01:31,160
Henkle, Robert F...

1055
02:01:31,368 --> 02:01:34,580
...Lieutenant J.G.,
United States Navy....

1056
02:02:02,065 --> 02:02:07,196
Reported missing July 1955,
Pensacola, Florida.

1057
02:02:07,362 --> 02:02:08,697
Monsieur Neary...

1058
02:02:09,406 --> 02:02:11,074
...what do you want?

1059
02:02:13,952 --> 02:02:17,164
I just wanna know
that it's really happening.

1060
02:02:20,417 --> 02:02:25,297
I went up in the air,
and I saw our house.

1061
02:02:25,547 --> 02:02:28,592
I saw you going up in the air.
Did you see me running after you?

1062
02:02:28,759 --> 02:02:31,136
- Yes.
- Yes?

1063
02:02:34,890 --> 02:02:36,975
All right, now we have to talk.

1064
02:02:39,895 --> 02:02:41,897
He wants to speak about
Mr. Neary's case.

1065
02:02:42,189 --> 02:02:44,733
Swensen, Matthew Daniel...

1066
02:02:44,942 --> 02:02:48,570
...reported missing April 1976.

1067
02:02:49,404 --> 02:02:52,241
- Are they going away?
- Yes.

1068
02:02:56,620 --> 02:02:57,663
Wait a second, wait.

1069
02:02:57,871 --> 02:03:01,959
He says these are ordinary people
under extraordinary circumstances.

1070
02:03:03,168 --> 02:03:06,380
Delores, Rudolph E...

1071
02:03:06,630 --> 02:03:10,175
...reported missing
December '51, Bisbee...

1072
02:03:10,676 --> 02:03:12,636
...Arizona.

1073
02:03:16,181 --> 02:03:17,474
Goodbye.

1074
02:03:28,402 --> 02:03:29,486
Monsieur Neary...

1075
02:03:31,655 --> 02:03:33,156
...I envy you.

1076
02:05:31,483 --> 02:05:34,277
Mr. Neary, I'm told that we can count on
your complete cooperation.

1077
02:05:34,444 --> 02:05:37,114
- What type of blood do you have?
- I don't have the slightest idea.

1078
02:05:37,280 --> 02:05:39,992
- What is your date of birth?
- December 4th, 1944.

1079
02:05:40,158 --> 02:05:42,619
Have you been inoculated
against smallpox, diphtheria?

1080
02:05:42,911 --> 02:05:45,914
Is there any history of liver disease
in your family?

1081
02:06:44,931 --> 02:06:47,517
May the Lord be praised at all times.

1082
02:06:47,726 --> 02:06:50,479
May God help us
and grant us a happy journey.

1083
02:06:50,645 --> 02:06:52,022
Show us your ways.

1084
02:06:52,189 --> 02:06:54,066
And lead us along your paths.

1085
02:06:54,274 --> 02:06:57,861
God has given you his angels
charge over you.

1086
02:06:58,028 --> 02:07:01,698
Grant these pilgrims,
we pray, a happy journey...

1087
02:07:01,865 --> 02:07:06,870
