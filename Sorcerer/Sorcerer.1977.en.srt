1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:23,800
- Pull up easy.
<i>- The temperature in Newark is 54.</i>

3
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:27,430
<i>In Morristown it's 57,
and in Asbury Park...</i>

4
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:25,890
Saint Dominic's: $2,712.

5
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,360
Saint Michael's: $983.

6
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:31,960
What do you have
on Saint Bartholomew?

7
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,400
- Fifty-eight.
- $5,800?

8
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,410
George, what about Loyola?

9
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:39,000
All right, up against the wall!

10
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,010
What is this?
What's going on?

11
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,980
My dear friends, you have
come together in this church...

12
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:46,980
that the Lord may seal
and strengthen your love...

13
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:50,580
in the presence of the church's
minister and this community.

14
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:52,590
Christ abundantly blesses you.

15
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:56,060
- Oh, my God!
- Get that money!

16
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:59,720
- What are you doing?
- Do you know whose parish this is?

17
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,890
Fuck you
and the horse you rode in on.

18
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:04,530
May daily problems
never cause you anxiety...

19
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,940
or the desire for earthly
possessions dominate your lives.

20
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:10,240
May you find happiness
and satisfaction in your work.

21
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,530
Just kiss that pipe, boys.

22
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:19,240
Shut up!

23
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,510
You have declared your consent
before the church.

24
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:25,680
May the Lord strengthen your consent
and fill you with His blessings.

25
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,490
What God has joined
man must not divide.

26
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,260
Leave the change alone!

27
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:35,220
- Don't touch it.
- Beautiful.

28
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:39,670
May Almighty God bless you.
The Father, Son and the Holy Spirit.

29
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:52,940
We've been hit!

30
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,310
Son of a bitch!

31
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:01,920
In the days I went a-courtin'
I was never tired of resortin'

32
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:05,660
To the ale house or the playhouse
And many's the house besides.

33
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:09,830
As sure as me name is Barney
I'll be off to "Californy".

34
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,270
Instead of diggin' praddies
I'll be diggin' lumps of coal.

35
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:27,180
- Don't get us glommed over.
- No way.

36
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,380
We've already got a driver
in the car.

37
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:33,520
Keep it up.

38
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:36,860
Don't press me, pal.

39
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:39,160
Couldn't you have stopped him
without doing that?

40
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:41,360
Shut your mouth
before you get it.

41
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:45,030
- What do you mean?
- Just what I'm tellin' ya, hard on.

42
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,660
If you'd shoot a priest for $67,000,
how much is my life worth?

43
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,330
Zero.

44
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:54,340
You're a piece of shit.

45
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:58,200
- You bastard!
- What are you doing?

46
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,150
Look out!

47
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:30,280
He's gone! He's gone!

48
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:32,340
We better leave 'em
till the cops get here.

49
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,600
Ooh!

50
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,950
Call another ambulance.

51
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:17,660
- There's one in back.
- There's a guy in the car here.

52
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:19,630
Hurt awful bad.

53
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,760
Everybody stay out of the way
and let these guys through.

54
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,010
Hey, Mickey, over here!

55
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:07,740
What's the latest on your brother,
Mr. Ricci?

56
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:10,780
- He's gonna be all right.
- That's fine. Thank God.

57
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,980
One of those pigs
walked away from that accident.

58
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:17,710
His name is Jackie Scanlon.

59
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:20,280
He's a punk from Queens
with the Donnelly mob.

60
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,790
Real piece of shit.

61
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:26,060
Mr. Ricci, everybody wants
to help you on this.

62
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:27,960
The guy can't make a move.

63
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,144
He can't go nowheres.

64
00:22:30,344 --> 00:22:32,490
Could be on his way
to the moon by now.

65
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:36,010
We'll get the best, but it's gonna
have to come from the outside...

66
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:37,560
and it's gonna cost.

67
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:41,210
He robbed my church.

68
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,840
Shot my brother.

69
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:48,680
I don't care where he is
or what it costs. I want his ass.

70
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:08,270
- You got a problem.
- Tell me about it.

71
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:11,710
- You're on the hit parade.
- What?

72
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:14,540
That priest you whacked
was Carlo Ricci's brother.

73
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:18,450
Forget the heat. Ricci himself
is out looking for you.

74
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:23,380
- I never carry a pistol.
- Want to tell him that in person?

75
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:25,480
Got any money?

76
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,990
Two thousand.

77
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,950
- How about a passport?
- What for?

78
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:32,550
For 2,000 I'll get you a passport.

79
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,790
- You mean out of the country?
- Uh-huh.

80
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:41,460
- Where?
- A good place to stay low.

81
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,940
Why?

82
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:45,600
It's a place nobody
wants to look in.

83
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,080
It's covered, okay?

84
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:51,480
- Where am I going?
- Get a train in Baltimore.

85
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:53,480
Go to pier 47.

86
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:56,140
At customs, ask for Nat Glick.

87
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,380
Don't mention my name.

88
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:02,590
As of right now, I don't know you
and I don't want to know you.

89
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:06,430
I owed you a favor.
This is it.

90
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,520
You gonna tell me where I'm going?

91
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,530
I swear to Christ, I don't know.

92
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:16,070
No!

93
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,730
Ramirez.

94
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,530
Serrano.

95
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,090
Marquez.

96
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,640
I am in transit.

97
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:32,080
<i>Transito</i>, me

98
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:36,880
- I am going to Managua.
- Ah, Managua. <i>Si. Pase.</i>

99
00:30:42,138 --> 00:30:44,375
Can I get something to drink?

100
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,530
In the plane with my baggage.
I'm very thirsty.

101
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,100
Pase.

102
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,760
Forget it, pal.

103
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,770
Stop eating. A year's pay might get you
a seat to the next rat hole. Come on.

104
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:59,730
I have three rooms.

105
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:18,980
One of them's taken.

106
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:45,180
I'll take it.

107
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:47,180
- For how long?
- Let's say a week.

108
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:48,240
How much do you suppose
from here to Argentina?

109
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:52,080
An airline ticket
costs 470 pesos.

110
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:55,550
Passports, maybe another thousand.

111
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:58,140
I have less than 100.

112
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,190
Everything I could save in a year.

113
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:06,260
My house, maybe for 600,
if I could sell it.

114
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,570
Can you understand English?

115
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,410
Yes, I speak some.

116
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:27,140
- Want to travel away?
- Yes.

117
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:29,810
I can fix for you la capital.

118
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:33,950
- I want to go out of this country.
- Out of this country? <i>Dificil.</i>

119
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,990
Very difficult.

120
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,550
Impossible?

121
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:40,560
<i>No, es posible.
Costoso.</i>

122
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,530
<i>¿Comprende?</i> Cost much.

123
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:44,700
Understood.

124
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:07,120
I can fix for you
to go out from the country.

125
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:12,460
- This <i>reloj</i> plus 1,000 pesos.
- I have only the watch.

126
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:39,420
Whiskey.

127
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,930
<i>Danke shon.</i>

128
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,440
- Put it on my account.
- Thank you.

129
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:03,240
During the work it's hotter.

130
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:06,940
- Yeah. I like a southern exposure.
- Yes.

131
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:09,380
I thought about it myself.

132
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,990
I understand
you used to be in banking.

133
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:20,000
That's the rumor.

134
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:24,220
I had no idea
I was the subject of rumors.

135
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,630
Carlos used to be
an ex Reichs Marschall.

136
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,140
Right, Carlos?

137
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:35,570
What is your profession, Mr...?

138
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:38,980
- Dominguez.
- Dominguez.

139
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:40,310
Ice hockey.

140
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:44,620
Read about this place
in a travel brochure?

141
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,490
I heard it had a healthy climate.

142
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,660
Not what you expected.

143
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:55,250
It was exactly what I expected.

144
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:14,380
Juan Dominguez?

145
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:18,890
Aren't you the laborer,
Juan Dominguez?

146
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:29,030
No.

147
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,930
You don't understand, huh?

148
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,940
Let's see your identity card.

149
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,300
What?

150
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:39,860
The identity card you keep here.

151
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:53,090
Juan Dominguez,
born November 1939...

152
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,890
in Las Calumnas in this country.

153
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,930
That is you?

154
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:04,770
You don't look to me like you
were born in Las Calumnas.

155
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:09,470
Because you don't even
speak Spanish.

156
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:13,100
And because you are
a filthy gringo asshole.

157
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:16,710
This is false.

158
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:19,810
It's a violation
of the immigration laws.

159
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:28,150
Hey!

160
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,500
Do you have more?

161
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,760
That's it.

162
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:16,270
Okay, next time you pay.

163
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:19,510
You make three...

164
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:22,600
we take one.

165
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,110
Understand?

166
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:27,740
<i>Understood.</i>

167
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:30,080
Okay.

168
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:35,280
I need my card.

169
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:42,160
I can't make shit without my card.

170
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:45,220
- I need that.
- Ah.

171
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:09,060
<i>Adiós, senor</i> Dominguez.

172
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:45,590
It should produce twice as much as
this last zone that we come out of.

173
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,460
When can you get this one
pinched off?

174
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:51,260
Our trucks have
already been ordered.

175
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:52,820
They should be here.

176
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,390
Very professional.

177
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:53,990
Get it to the capital.
Maybe we'll get results.

178
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:56,290
The government's been told
it was an accident.

179
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,770
What?

180
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:03,000
In this country, terrorists who blow
up American oil wells are heroes.

181
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:06,010
We're paying that government
to give us protection.

182
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,270
El presidente cannot risk
his liberal image...

183
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:10,840
by sending us troops
to chase patriots.

184
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:12,350
Shit!

185
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:15,840
This is a telex from home
responding to my report.

186
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,750
First part concerns...

187
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:21,620
regret loss of life, etcetera,
injuries and so on.

188
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:25,060
Apparently we have no insurance
position because of the sabotage thing.

189
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:27,650
This is the part that concerns you.

190
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:29,760
"Limitations on production
in recent months...

191
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:32,530
due to acts of terrorism
and political uncertainties...

192
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:36,500
emphasize attention
immediate supply obligations...

193
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:39,010
with minimum concern R&D...

194
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,510
What is R & D?

195
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:43,140
Research and Development.

196
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:46,080
"Please apprise
course of action soonest."

197
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:48,710
It's signed, "Weber."

198
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:51,020
Is that it?

199
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:52,520
Yes.

200
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:09,530
What are the immediate
supply obligations?

201
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:14,370
One tanker, 16o, 000 barrels
by the end of next month.

202
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,740
We need that well to fill it.

203
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:18,750
They'll have to delay it.

204
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:22,980
They can't.

205
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:25,350
Charter's running. If we have
to take a loss that big...

206
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:28,450
we might as well shut down now
and save expenses.

207
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:08,100
I've seen worse.

208
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:13,840
Let's clear away that junk
and blow her out.

209
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,930
This stuff is too dry to spark.

210
00:50:32,410 --> 00:50:34,410
That stuff has been sitting
for a year.

211
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,580
- It's worthless.
- What do you mean?

212
00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:39,640
When it sits a long time
without being turned...

213
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:42,190
that liquid nitro seeps out
of the sticks and into the bag.

214
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:44,560
If you give those cases
any kind of a bump, it'll blow.

215
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:52,330
It's risky moving a case ten feet.
That fire's over 200 miles away.

216
00:50:53,270 --> 00:50:55,360
If it were up there,
could you use it?

217
00:50:56,810 --> 00:50:59,300
We could boom-load
a little at a time. Yes.

218
00:50:59,370 --> 00:51:01,370
How you gonna get it there?

219
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:04,140
That's not your problem.
We'll get it there.

220
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:23,290
What do you think?

221
00:51:23,370 --> 00:51:26,990
The major problem is the vibration.
This thing is like an egg beater.

222
00:51:27,070 --> 00:51:31,670
No matter how we shock-mount something,
it will have a severe lateral vibration.

223
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:35,680
I thought maybe you could
swing-load it on a pallet.

224
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:39,370
Twenty feet down there's no vibration,
but the problem is turbulence.

225
00:51:39,450 --> 00:51:42,010
We might move it half a mile
that way but not 200.

226
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:44,850
We've never had a flight here
without some turbulence in it.

227
00:51:47,590 --> 00:51:49,180
What are you saying?

228
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:51,690
Not with a chopper.
There's no way.

229
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,760
I'll double the amount
if you can think of a way.

230
00:51:55,830 --> 00:51:59,230
It's not the money. Nobody's gonna
get into a chopper with that shit.

231
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:00,960
You need a suicide jockey.

232
00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:06,710
We now need
experienced truck drivers...

233
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:09,010
men who are willing
to do a dangerous job.

234
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:11,810
This job must be done...

235
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:16,940
before we can reopen our gates and
bring back full employment to you people.

236
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:22,890
The men who qualify
will receive exceptional wages.

237
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:25,950
Only experienced truck drivers
willing to risk their life can do it.

238
00:52:26,030 --> 00:52:27,960
No one else should apply.

239
00:52:28,030 --> 00:52:31,400
The company will pay 8,000 pesos
to each driver.

240
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,830
Wait a minute!

241
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:42,870
Four men with enough guts...

242
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:45,110
can save Poza Rica
and your village!

243
00:52:57,260 --> 00:53:00,920
- Stop at the bottom of the hill.
- I need to know the machine.

244
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,430
Pull over.

245
00:53:41,070 --> 00:53:43,300
You crazy bastard!

246
00:53:58,090 --> 00:54:00,580
Teamster?

247
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:02,090
Greyhound.

248
00:54:20,410 --> 00:54:23,240
Serrano.

249
00:54:23,310 --> 00:54:25,010
Dominguez.

250
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:26,740
Marquez.

251
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:29,080
Martinez.

252
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:34,720
We're carrying three cases each.

253
00:59:34,790 --> 00:59:39,020
One is enough to blow your fire. Six
cases will blow out the whole field.

254
00:59:39,090 --> 00:59:42,790
You don't think all the trucks
will make it. One of us is a backup.

255
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:48,000
We want double, and legal residence,
or we don't drive.

256
00:59:52,970 --> 00:59:55,030
You leave in four hours.

257
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:51,160
Only one machete?

258
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:53,670
How many would you like?

259
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:57,070
Have to put half the jungle underneath
our wheels to get through the mud.

260
01:00:57,140 --> 01:00:59,070
How many machetes
you want us to carry?

261
01:00:59,140 --> 01:01:01,070
Should be two.

262
01:01:01,810 --> 01:01:04,800
Condensers. Points.

263
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:06,470
Floats. Filters.

264
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:11,110
Tape. Wire.
Channel locks.

265
01:01:11,190 --> 01:01:12,740
Rags.

266
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:15,650
- Where's the rest of this cable?
- In the car.

267
01:01:16,830 --> 01:01:19,660
Where the hell is the German?

268
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:32,710
She's got something for you.

269
01:01:43,350 --> 01:01:44,880
What is it?

270
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:13,810
Marquez!

271
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:21,050
Marquez!

272
01:03:04,070 --> 01:03:07,930
Murderer! Zionist!
I'll kill you!

273
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,340
What happened? What happened?

274
01:03:11,410 --> 01:03:13,570
This Jew dog cut his throat!

275
01:03:16,270 --> 01:03:17,447
No police.

276
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:21,910
Hold it! We lost a driver.
We need another one.

277
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:25,280
When the money's up,
I'm as good as any of you.

278
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:07,360
Where you from?

279
01:04:07,430 --> 01:04:10,960
Listen, Pancho, I've been clocking you
every second that you got into this town.

280
01:04:11,030 --> 01:04:13,970
If you pick your nose in this truck,
clear it with me first...

281
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:16,530
or I'll take you and this nitro
into a ditch.

282
01:04:59,010 --> 01:05:01,070
They've had 15 minutes.

283
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:03,380
Yes.

284
01:05:03,450 --> 01:05:04,880
One moment.

285
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:09,660
I have a letter.

286
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:14,020
- I wonder if you would post it for me?
- Paris.

287
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:16,830
- That could take a month.
- Yes.

288
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:21,700
- Just keep it for me.
- I'll take care of it.

289
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:18,010
Get outta there!

290
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:40,190
Get the hell outta there!

291
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:31,740
I guide you.

292
01:09:34,860 --> 01:09:37,480
No. You drive,
and I guide you. Okay?

293
01:11:31,310 --> 01:11:33,240
Get in the truck.

294
01:11:33,310 --> 01:11:34,640
- Come on!
- No!

295
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:42,810
Come on!

296
01:13:58,090 --> 01:14:00,580
Okay.

297
01:14:20,270 --> 01:14:21,540
Is this the road to Poza Rica?

298
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:49,540
That's the wrong road.

299
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:52,570
I think this road's better for us
because it's higher.

300
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:55,010
We take this one.

301
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:58,530
You don't understand. This road is
too low. It goes through the swamp.

302
01:14:58,610 --> 01:15:00,580
There's too much mud.

303
01:15:00,650 --> 01:15:04,580
Can't you read a map?
We have no information on that road.

304
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:08,910
You're full of shit!
You take that road!

305
01:15:11,230 --> 01:15:13,250
We follow the map.

306
01:15:59,970 --> 01:16:02,140
It's the wrong road.

307
01:16:09,150 --> 01:16:11,080
This is the wrong road!

308
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:07,300
Where the hell are you going?

309
01:17:15,250 --> 01:17:17,550
We're going across that bridge...

310
01:17:17,620 --> 01:17:19,610
and you're going to guide me...

311
01:17:19,690 --> 01:17:21,710
because I can't do it alone.

312
01:20:20,570 --> 01:20:23,160
They've had it.

313
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:26,930
We're sitting on double shares.
2o, 000 apiece!

314
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:31,310
No way they're gonna make
that bridge, I'll tell ya that.

315
01:20:31,380 --> 01:20:33,570
That's 2o, 000 apiece.

316
01:20:33,650 --> 01:20:36,980
We're sitting on 2o, 000.
Double shares.

317
01:20:51,430 --> 01:20:52,690
Come on!

318
01:20:58,540 --> 01:21:00,170
Come on!

319
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:02,000
Stop! Stop!

320
01:21:12,650 --> 01:21:15,450
Come on!
Stop! Stop! Stop!

321
01:21:19,590 --> 01:21:20,960
Stay close!

322
01:21:40,910 --> 01:21:43,880
Where are you?

323
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:50,880
Where are you?

324
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:03,970
Stop! Stop!

325
01:22:05,810 --> 01:22:07,930
- Stop!
- I don't see you!

326
01:22:08,010 --> 01:22:10,270
Stop! No!

327
01:22:11,310 --> 01:22:13,840
Stop! Stop!

328
01:22:13,910 --> 01:22:15,440
Stop! Stop!

329
01:22:17,380 --> 01:22:18,610
No!

330
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:24,550
Are you all right?

331
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:39,270
The winch!

332
01:22:41,810 --> 01:22:44,000
Get the winch!

333
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:29,180
Come on!

334
01:24:29,250 --> 01:24:31,580
Come on! Come on!

335
01:24:46,130 --> 01:24:49,230
Come! Come!

336
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:09,710
Come, come!

337
01:25:33,410 --> 01:25:35,970
Yes, come!

338
01:25:46,990 --> 01:25:48,820
Come!

339
01:25:55,270 --> 01:25:57,930
Come! Come! Come!

340
01:26:04,410 --> 01:26:07,540
Come on! Come! Come!

341
01:26:12,250 --> 01:26:16,420
Come on! Come on! Come on!

342
01:28:33,990 --> 01:28:39,300
You're crazy.

343
01:29:26,250 --> 01:29:28,650
It's eight trees!

344
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:31,150
No way.

345
01:29:46,030 --> 01:29:47,970
Start chopping!

346
01:29:50,970 --> 01:29:52,900
Make your move.

347
01:31:02,210 --> 01:31:04,940
<i>Kaoba.</i>

348
01:31:05,010 --> 01:31:06,950
Excellent wood.

349
01:31:07,010 --> 01:31:11,040
We're going around it
if we can hack out eight trees.

350
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:16,550
If you cut them down,
how do you move them?

351
01:31:16,620 --> 01:31:18,060
The winch.

352
01:31:18,120 --> 01:31:21,990
How are you going to clear the
stumps or drive through a swamp?

353
01:31:22,060 --> 01:31:24,260
We're gonna go through it!

354
01:31:24,330 --> 01:31:25,760
Impossible.

355
01:31:25,830 --> 01:31:27,490
Impossible?

356
01:32:28,490 --> 01:32:30,550
I think I can clear it.

357
01:34:26,380 --> 01:34:27,810
Too small.

358
01:34:31,650 --> 01:34:33,780
Show me your pockets.

359
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:06,440
Perfect.

360
01:41:34,270 --> 01:41:36,210
Are you from Paris?

361
01:41:36,280 --> 01:41:38,840
- I lived there. Yes.
- Where?

362
01:41:40,680 --> 01:41:42,770
Do you know Paris?

363
01:41:42,850 --> 01:41:45,320
I was there for two days.

364
01:41:46,390 --> 01:41:49,950
- Very expensive.
- So they say.

365
01:41:50,020 --> 01:41:52,250
Your family is there?

366
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:56,560
- My wife. Just my wife.
- No children?

367
01:41:56,630 --> 01:41:58,260
No children.

368
01:42:01,230 --> 01:42:04,500
I met my wife...

369
01:42:04,570 --> 01:42:08,800
when I first came to Paris.

370
01:42:16,280 --> 01:42:21,550
The day she gave me this
was the last day I saw her.

371
01:42:28,730 --> 01:42:31,960
It's five minutes before 9:00
in Paris.

372
01:44:06,860 --> 01:44:08,420
Dominguez.

373
01:44:25,440 --> 01:44:27,570
Get down.

374
01:44:27,650 --> 01:44:29,580
Get down on the ground!

375
01:44:58,910 --> 01:45:01,810
What do you have in the truck?

376
01:45:04,180 --> 01:45:05,910
Supplies.

377
01:45:05,980 --> 01:45:07,580
What supplies?

378
01:45:07,650 --> 01:45:09,120
Vienna sausage.

379
01:45:10,190 --> 01:45:11,620
Wonder bread.

380
01:45:12,520 --> 01:45:13,960
Northern Tissue.

381
01:45:16,130 --> 01:45:17,560
Kleenex.

382
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:20,930
Nothing else?

383
01:45:27,340 --> 01:45:31,440
Okay. So you got just what we need.
You don't have to be afraid from us.

384
01:45:53,700 --> 01:45:58,100
Listen, amigo, just come out.
We just need this truck.

385
01:45:58,170 --> 01:46:00,930
We need food, you know...

386
01:46:01,010 --> 01:46:03,670
and toilet paper.

387
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:39,270
What are you gonna do
with all that money?

388
01:47:39,340 --> 01:47:41,770
Talk to me!
What are you gonna do?

389
01:47:43,640 --> 01:47:45,270
Get laid.

390
01:47:48,850 --> 01:47:51,010
Best whore in Managua.

391
01:47:52,450 --> 01:47:54,540
Two whores.

392
01:47:54,620 --> 01:47:58,060
- Two best whores in Managua.
- You do it.

393
01:47:59,830 --> 01:48:02,060
- Do it for me.
- With you, Pancho.

394
01:48:02,130 --> 01:48:06,290
- You do it for me. Okay?
- I'll do it!

395
01:48:22,750 --> 01:48:24,940
What do you mean you don't know?

396
01:48:27,890 --> 01:48:30,790
Get a train down to Baltimore.
Go to pier 47.

397
01:48:30,860 --> 01:48:35,120
Where am I goin'?
Where am I goin'?

398
01:49:16,470 --> 01:49:17,800
Where am I goin'?

399
01:49:17,870 --> 01:49:19,860
What do you mean you don't know?

400
01:54:20,710 --> 01:54:23,540
- It's good.
- No good to me.

401
01:54:23,610 --> 01:54:29,140
Do I take it to a bank, flash an I.D.,
give a thumbprint? Our deal was cash.

402
01:54:29,210 --> 01:54:33,450
Head office is sending Gus Lefferts
to meet you.

403
01:54:33,520 --> 01:54:36,150
He'll take you to our bank. You'll
have that cashed before supper.

404
01:54:39,220 --> 01:54:43,160
Ask Lefferts what's available
in the capital.

405
01:54:43,230 --> 01:54:45,250
I told him you were
a first-rate driver.

406
01:54:45,330 --> 01:54:47,060
Not anymore.

407
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:49,430
Yeah, well.

408
01:54:50,500 --> 01:54:53,200
Find anything good, send a postcard.
Maybe I'll join you.

409
01:54:55,570 --> 01:54:58,340
You'd give all this up?

410
01:54:58,410 --> 01:55:01,810
In six months time, who knows?
I may have no choice.

411
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:12,650
You know, there, uh...
There's one place down here...

412
01:55:12,720 --> 01:55:16,390
that might be nice for a guy
in your situation.

413
01:55:16,460 --> 01:55:19,520
Ever think of going to Managua?

414
01:55:19,600 --> 01:55:21,690
Managua?

415
01:55:21,770 --> 01:55:25,200
Shit! There's no way
I can go to Managua.

416
01:55:25,270 --> 01:55:27,740
Too bad. It's a nice place.

417
01:55:27,810 --> 01:55:31,940
No. Managua is no good for me.

418
01:55:34,610 --> 01:55:36,840
Carlos, <i>haben Sie scotch, bitte?</i>

419
01:55:50,360 --> 01:55:54,800
Oh, when you get into Bonao,
would you mail that for me?

420
01:56:43,555 --> 01:56:47,259
- Do I have a couple of minutes?
- For you, they'll hold the plane.

421
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:12,400
May I have this dance?
