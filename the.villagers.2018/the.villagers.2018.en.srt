00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,470

Welcome.

00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:00,310
What brings you to our dinner?

11
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,750
Why did you bring that?

12
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,230
Come sit down.

he's giving up boxing.

Why don't you sit down, we can talk.

Jeez, what a con man...

What? A con man?

Sir

20
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,870
my kids starve themselves
to train for this,

That worthless boxer really took
after his coach.

You'd be in jail if it wasn't for us.

00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,510
Come outside, come!

30
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:04,630
- Stop it!
- What's with you again?

31
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,430
Move aside, move!

32

Stop it! What's with you two?

33
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,670
Are you okay? You got to breathe!

34
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,190
Breathe!

35
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:22,390
Even so, you beat up
the association's vice chair?

36
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:27,990
With your expulsion,
you can't even coach now.

37
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,100
It was so hard getting you this gig,

38
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,820
so don't cause any trouble.

39
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,220
At least you can be a teacher, got it?

00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,340
Okay, I'll do my best.

41
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,620

How could anyone doodle on this?

54
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,580
I better erase it.

Hey, Dong-su.

you got a death wish?

00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,420
Don't fight here, go home.

00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:16,900
Buddy, walk away, don't annoy us.

00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,570
Are they harassing you?

73
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,820
Does it look like that?

74
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:25,150
That's a rock, you're harassing them?

75
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,900
We're the bullies!

76
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:31,330
You three looked like it,
you're harassing her?

77
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:34,660
Don't make presumptions
based on looks.

78
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,940
Anyway, don't fight, and go home!

79
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:47,340
When Su-yeon comes back, I'll ask her.

80
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:52,220
If she's not coming home
because of you,

81
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,780
you're dead.

82
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:00,380
What a psycho...

83
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,060
Coach! What are you doing there?

84
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,740
It's been so long!

85
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,670
3 years, probably.

86
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,060
You're still the same.

87
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,440
I was so surprised to hear
that you were coming here.

88
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:14,340
Sure.

89
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:19,500

00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:34,660

Hey there, Yu-jin.

92
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:42,260
Here, I got you some pain reliever.

93
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,660

94
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:51,700

No...

96
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,740
I called the police, so don't worry.

97
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,860
I hope she's not missing meals.

98
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:22,940
Su-yeon!

99
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,020
What's this? This looks new.

100
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:28,810
Isn't it pretty?

101
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,110
Who is it?

102
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:32,650
You!

103
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,260
Why do you only draw butterflies?

104
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,300
They're so free.

105
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:44,810
When I become an adult,

106
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:48,580
I want to be free too.

107
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:56,220
So cringy, even for you, right?

108
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:00,780
I want to be pretty and be free!

109
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,940
Fly freely!

110
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:07,970
I better go.

111
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,500
Part-time work?

112
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,980
What do we do with that?

113
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,300

00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,980
Cut off their alcohol supply line.

118
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,500
Let them try running a bar
without any booze.

119
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,020
- What happened?
- Boss.

120
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:34,036
- We're re-educating her.
- I didn't do it!

121
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,740
I'm busy with the chairman,

122
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,420
so take care of it.

123

Keep a lid on them!

124
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,540
Yes, boss.

125
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,580
VIPs are coming tomorrow,

126
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,500

The homeroom teachers

we hope to collect at least 80%.

00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:31,400
I did some work as a

- Sit over there.
- There...

147

- You okay?
- Are you okay?

148
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,860
You okay?

149
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,720
You could've been hurt.

150
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,780
That's mine!

151
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:41,530

- Hello.
- Are you all right?

157
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,200
She could've been hurt.

158
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:03,520
Got to be careful.

159
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:07,130
Must be hard being a dean of students.

160
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,050
Not at all.

161
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:11,250
Nah, I did it once too.

162
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:14,650
It's not easy trying to get money
from the kids.

163
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,330
Let me give you a tip.

164
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:20,350
Lunchtime is the best time.

165
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,220
Everyone's together at the cafeteria.

166
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,840
I see, right.

167
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,060
Please take this.

168
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:31,740
- Thank you.
- Yup.

169
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:33,580

No, I'm not.

Who's that man?

173
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,470
I heard he's a gym teacher.

174
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,700
Look at that face!

175
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,660
I'll take care of that on my own.

176
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,830
Yeah?

177
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,470
You're bothering us during lunch?

178
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,710
Girls,

179
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:19,700
is there Yang Se-hee here?

180
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:28,220
We made a reservation
for you, chairman.

181
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:31,180
I prefer to have lunch
with the students and chat.

182
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,690
Good afternoon.

183
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,100
Mr. Yuk.

184
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:35,930
He's a former Asian Champion,

185
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:37,680
and coached boxing club.

186
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:41,490
Is that so? Good to meet you.

187
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:45,250
You look so dependable.

188
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:47,970
Take good care of them.

189
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:50,180
Who's that fatty?

190
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:54,860
He's a new dean,
who's collecting lunch money.

191
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,430
Jeez, he looks like a gangster.

195

Why?

196
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,210
You are.

197
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:25,060
You didn't pay this semester's tuition,
it's $432.60.

198
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:26,410
I'll pay.

199
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,790
I'm not scolding you for not paying,

200
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:32,190
but you won't graduate if you don't.

201
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,146
Then I won't graduate.

202
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:36,740
Right, what? You have to graduate!

203
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,080
Wait,

00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,860
isn't there Han Su-yeon in your class?

205
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,800
What about her?

206
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:48,770
She hasn't paid since last year,
it's over $1,070,

207
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:51,860
is she a runaway?
She doesn't come to school.

208
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,390
She's not a runaway.

209
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,820
I was just asking.

210
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:59,510
Don't assume anything
without knowing her.

211
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,760
Why is everyone in this town
always so angry?

Who told you post this

It's obvious I won't get it.

Kang Yu-jin,

217
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:27,890
stop worrying about the runaway,
and mind your business.

218
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:33,560
So many people got in trouble
for being nosy...

219
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:36,380
You should mind your students!

220
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,870
I'd have beaten them back

No one called you.

00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,870
Good afternoon.

228
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,580
You get gassy as you get older.

229
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:40,970
Quite a bit.

00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,540
- Mr. Yuk.
- Yes?

Going on a patrol for the kids
in town later?

Yes.

233
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:50,560
If you go behind the bank,

234
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:53,730
a ton of kids smoke there.

235
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:54,480
I see.

236
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:59,120
Also visit the homes of
students who didn't pay.

I'm doing my very best,
so no need to worry.

238

And I'm going on a patrol,
so I'll call you later.

239

- $1.

The halted bridge construction is

243
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:29,740
a vital business to our economy!

244
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,720
We will not harm the environment!

245
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,230
You're full of garbage!

246
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,930

Let go! Don't touch me!

255
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,090
Hey!

256
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:17,860
Can I ask you something?

257
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,260
Do you know her?

Where do you think you are?

Look at that, isn't that Chae-lim?

260
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:26,160
Su-yeon's name was Chae-lim here?

261
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:27,810
- Who's Su-yeon?
- Buddy.

262
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,800
Get out.

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,360
Where are you going?

266
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,260
You can't go up there!

267
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:42,310
My apologies, she's my student.

268
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:44,810
I'm a school teacher.

269
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:45,776
Hey, Kang Yu-jin!

270
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,640
Hey, teach!

271
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:47,970
Are you kidding me? Come here!

272
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:48,850
Excuse me...

There's no one like that, get out!

00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:56,100
I'll take her, so let her go.

276
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:57,150
Son of a gun!

277
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,170
Let her go.

278
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,380
You jerk...

279
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,940
I've had it.

280
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,000
We'll go quietly,
let's not make trouble.

281
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,580
- I have to ask the ladies.
- Forget it, just go!

282
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:03,550
I can't just leave!

283
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:06,560
That man called her Chae-lim
after seeing her photo.

284
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:09,190
He could be mistaken.

285
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:11,230
You're not allowed at a place
like this.

286
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,980
Come talk to me, I'm your teacher.

287
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,190
Don't pretend to care
and waste our time.

288
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:19,870
I'm not, cases like

289
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:22,250
this must be thoroughly investigated.

290
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,280
Why are you so impatient?

291
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:27,850
Stick with the toy crane.

292
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:32,500
So you saw, but that was...

293
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:38,090
I'm not really sure...

294
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:40,080
Look carefully.

295
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:43,600
She worked here
under the name Chae-lim, right?

296
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,650
I don't know.

297
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:48,650
Madame Iseul should know
about other girls.

298
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,040
Madame Iseul?

299
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,940
I'm sorry, I got to go.

300
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,250
I see...

301
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:58,830
We love these!

302
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:00,810
Always be healthy.

303
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:02,110
- Byung-doo.
- Yes?

304
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,380
- Thank him for us.
- Absolutely!

305
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,760
Come on, get in here!

306
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:08,990
- Welcome.
- Come in.

307
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:11,450
Treat them well tonight.

308
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:15,140
It's been a while,
have a lot fun, okay?

309
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,410
Okay!

310
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:24,170
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

311
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:35,090
Didn't she look like
she was hiding something?

312
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:39,210
That Madame should know more.

313
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:44,530
Okay, I hear you,

314
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:48,170
but it's late, head home
before your parents worry.

315
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:51,110
You're not worried about Su-yeon?

316
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:52,760
She didn't come to school today too.

317
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,680
I'll talk to her homeroom teacher.

318
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:57,540
You think I didn't try that?

319
00:25:57,870 --> 00:26:00,950
There's not a single adult
who will listen to me.

320
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,040
Not even the police.

321
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:07,650
No one cares, who'll find her then?

322
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:13,210
I'll talk to my police friend.

323
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:15,950
Stop worrying about it
and just come to school.

324
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,290
No skipping.

325
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:31,010
Where do you live?

326
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:33,150
Forget it, drop me off here.

327
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:35,250
I'll take you home, where is it?

328
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,810
I can go home on my own,
drop me off here!

329
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,910
But this is...

330
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,190
Hey, you'll break the door...

331
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:48,890
That brat...

332
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:51,370
Adults won't listen to me.

333
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,420

She's so clumsy.

00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,720
What's that?

338
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,740
Yu-jin?

339
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,780
Hey!

340
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,540
Who was that?

341
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:53,830
Yu-jin!

342
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:57,690
Yu-jin! Are you okay?

343
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,560
<i>Kochun General Hospital</i>

344
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,810
Thank you.

345
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:06,900
It looks like she didn't suffer
any serious injuries,

346
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:09,980
and we'll look into
the missing person case.

347
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,250
Sir, wait a moment.

348
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:17,240
That man could've kidnapped
my friend too.

349
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,600
Sure, I'll look into it too.

350
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,060
When exactly will you?

351
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,640
I made a report but nothing yet.

352
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,720
There's a procedure in place.

353
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:32,890
Don't worry and wait.

354
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:36,210
Don't worry too much,
we'll get back to you.

355
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:58,050
Good night.

356
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:05,790
What's with those cops?
They reek of booze.

357
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,920
Not doing their job too.

358
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:12,510
Since it's election period,
everyone's being pretty mum.

359
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,680
But this is no ordinary case.

360
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:17,410
He tased and attacked her.

361
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:21,400
They'll investigate properly,
don't you worry.

362
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:25,860
What about Yu-jin's report?
Why is nothing done?

363
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:28,170
Well, that's...

364
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:31,540
- It can't be filed.
- Why not?

365
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:35,700
It requires consent
from the immediate family...

366
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:38,090
Buddy, then why didn't you tell her?

367
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:41,430
Runaways are common for girls her age.

368
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,920
Coach, we'll take care of it,
you don't need to worry.

369
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:47,760
You're an outsider,
you shouldn't get involved.

370
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,290
Jeez...

371
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,760
<i>Han Su-yeon: Parents deceased,</i>

372
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:11,960
<i>lives with grandmother.</i>

373
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,160
<i>I hereby allow Yuk Ki-chul
to act on my behalf.</i>

374
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:40,090
The cops will do their best,

375
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:42,450
so don't worry too much.

376
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,100
Thank you for coming
all this way for Su-yeon.

377
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:50,700
Not at all, it's my duty.

378
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:55,040
After losing her parents,

379
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:57,390
she's been all alone.

380
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:05,960
But I'm so happy
someone like you is looking after her.

381
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:11,770
What's this about first thing
in the morning?

382
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:13,700
Here, take this.

383
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,700
What's this?

384
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,620
Consent form, file the report.

385
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:20,130
Coach, you did a pointless thing.

386
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:24,480
- Why is it pointless?
- I told you, we'll take care of it.

387
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:29,710
What's with you since yesterday?

388
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,040
What I mean is...

389
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,820
Is this how cops work down here?

390
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:36,770
Fine, fine, I'll take care of it.

391
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,170
Do it properly!

392
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:41,500
Look into a bar called Janus
where she used to work at.

393
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,560
Sure.

394
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:45,620
What a moron...

395
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:49,510
- Hurry it up.
- Sure.

396
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,280
The chairman's election isn't far off,

397
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:57,170
so keep a tight leash
on troublemakers.

398
00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:01,160
Can't you be on time?

399
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:08,940
On the election day,
make sure to vote on the way here.

400
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:13,560
Mr. Yuk, don't believe
the students too much.

401
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:17,620
Han Yu-jin had many problems
after transferring here from Seoul.

402
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:22,200
It's Kang Yu-jin.

403
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,230
Yes, Kang Yu-jin.

404
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,880
And look at this,

405
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:29,060
Han Su-yeon had
many unauthorized absents.

406
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:33,210
Then she'd show up
as if it was nothing.

407
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,640
I'm sure she ran away

408
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:38,740
and doing some stupid things.

409
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,440
Even so,

410
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:43,580
she disappeared
while working at a bar.

411
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:46,970
That's why she ran away.

412
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:50,080
It's obvious
what kind of a girl works there.

413
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:53,700
- What do you mean by that?
- Mr. Yuk, could we talk?

414
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:57,310
Why are you so gung-ho?

415
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:01,040
The country kids may feel naïve

416
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,260
but they really aren't.

417
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,360
But even so...

418
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:10,170
We had a student last semester
who went to Seoul for an audition,

419
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:13,510
and never came home.

420
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:16,680
- She was also never reported for missing person?
- No...

421
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,746
leave those kids alone,

422
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:23,340
and focus on collecting tuition.

423
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:26,180
That's how you get
high performance evaluation!

424
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,840
I understand.

425
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,040
Good.

426
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,720
Hey.

427
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,220
Why're you so desperate
to meet the madame?

428
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:48,310
I talked to my cop friend
this morning.

429
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,660
It's no point talking to cops
in this town.

430
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:55,570
You're not scared
even after what happened yesterday?

431
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,780
What if you really do get hurt?

432
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:01,040
Aren't you afraid
that you'd get hurt instead?

433
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:04,380
What'd you do if Su-yeon
was your daughter?

434
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:07,800
Just collect money from kids
and wait for cops to do their job?

435
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:09,790
But...

436
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,220
What I mean is...

437
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:16,690
When you helped me leave at the bar,

438
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:20,030
I thought you'd be different.

439
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:27,710
Stick with collecting money
from the girls!

440
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,580
You brat!

441
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:40,860
Yu-jin.

442
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:45,150
Is something wrong?

443
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,280
Det. Oh, what is it now?

444
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,270
The new case is her, right?

445
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:06,630
- The thing is...
- What did I tell you?

446
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,320
I told you not to report her case!

447
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,660
But he even got a consent form
so I couldn't refuse.

448
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,480
You jerk!

449
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:16,810
Get down to the station!

450
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,840
Right away.

451
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,540
I don't believe this.

452
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:55,670
Those brats!

453
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,720
Why you little!

454
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:03,150
Come out with your cigarettes!

455
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:05,740
- We didn't smoke.
- Like hell you didn't.

456
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:06,960
Got any evidence?

457
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:09,990
Smoke's coming out of your nose!
Give me the cigarettes!

458
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,570
You came to our bathroom.

459
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,920
I've had it, cough it up!

460
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:18,100
You're done if I find them,
stay right there.

461
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:20,410
So annoying.

462
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:21,790
Cigarette...

463
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:24,880
- Let's go.
- Where did you hide it?

464
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:26,810
Just stay right there!

465
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:31,970
Girls! Stop!

466
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:35,140
How did this fall?

467
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,520
Those punks...

468
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,560
What's this?

469
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:09,870
Yes, Vice Principal.

470
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:17,230
I'm here, sir, I found something in...

471
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:20,690
You were the one
who reported to the police?

472
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:21,670
Pardon?

473
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:24,350
Did you report our student missing?

474
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:26,710
I got a call from the police
for confirmation.

475
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:28,310
Yes, her name is Han Su-yeon.

476
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:29,910
Mr. Yuk,

477
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:31,920
I told you to keep a leash on them,

478
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:34,520
not pour gasoline to the fire.

479
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:38,580
But she has been absent
for a few days.

480
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,570
Mr. Yuk!

481
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:42,310
Why mention school affairs
to outside world?

482
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:44,170
Over some runaway!

483
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:47,150
But it doesn't look like a runaway...

484
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:48,470
Look here!

485
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,660
As your superior,

486
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:53,870
let me give you an advice.

487
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,850
Do your work and stay in line.

488
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:01,030
One bad apple can spoil the bunch.

489
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:42,990
Thank you for looking
into the art academy.

490
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:46,350
Sure, thanks.

491
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:04,470
Mr. Kim?

492
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:06,890
Are you heading out?

493
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,430
Yes.

494
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,910
Could you help me with these?

495
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:13,630
Um, sure.

496
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:15,150
Thank you!

497
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:18,110
Let's go, I'm in a rush.

498
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:15,430
<i>Kang Yu-jin: Where are you?</i>

499
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,510
<i>I'm on my way, wait a little longer.</i>

500
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,630
<i>Okay, I'm on my way too.</i>

501
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:24,740
<i>Han Su-yeon</i>

502
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:25,920
<i>I'm tied up with something,</i>

503
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,910
<i>could you come pick me up?</i>

504
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:28,990
<i>Yes, I'll be right there, wait for me.</i>

505
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:34,110
<i>Dumb Bear</i>

506
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:45,970
<i>Coach Yuk Ki-chul</i>

507
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:47,590
You idiot,

508
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:52,050
you defied my order
and reported it on your own?

509
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:04,920
Where are you?

510
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,260
None of your business.

511
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:07,750
Stop kidding around, where are you?

512
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:09,770
Are you with the art teacher?

513
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:13,050
Don't get in his car and see me.

514
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:14,130
Where are you?

515
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:15,780
What are you talking about?

516
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:18,640
He installed a spy cam
in girls' washroom.

517
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,120
He's a pervert!

518
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:24,970
Didn't Su-yeon disappear on July 6th?

519
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:26,490
Yes...

520
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:29,630
Right? I thought he was off.

521
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:32,050
I checked his messages,

522
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:34,880
he picked her up that night.

523
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:40,530
Tell me where you are.

524
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:43,010
So, the thing is...

525
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:47,630
Are you with him now?

526
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:49,210
Yes.

527
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:54,200
Text me where you are, got it?

528
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:55,510
Yes.

529
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:21,250
Who were you talking to?

530
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:26,950
My mom.

531
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:51,780
Got to put on the seat belt, Yu-jin.

532
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,520
By the way, sir,

533
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:23,600
isn't the town the other way?

534
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:26,460
I got to get something from home,

535
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,000
it won't take long.

536
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:51,050
Heading to his home.

537
00:44:56,050 --> 00:44:58,610
Heading to his home.

538
00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:00,530
Darn it...

539
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:09,650
Mr. Kim, did Su-yeon give you that?

540
00:45:12,730 --> 00:45:15,570
Yeah, it was a gift.

541
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:21,150
Did she ever contact you that day?

542
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:23,230
No.

543
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:26,060
- Then that night...
- Yu-jin.

544
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,960
Could we stop talking about her?

545
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:31,540
- After her art class...
- Yu-jin.

546
00:45:31,870 --> 00:45:34,370
- Were you with her...
- Darn it! Stop it!

547
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:04,020
Get up.

548
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:28,800
Yu-jin.

549
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:31,490
Let me see you.

550
00:46:31,970 --> 00:46:34,370
I didn't hit you
because I don't like you.

551
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:40,290
It's a misunderstanding,
I didn't do anything to her.

552
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:56,970
Don't look at me like that.

553
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,160
No, I didn't do anything to her.

554
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:16,980
It's the truth.

555
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:19,890
You got it all wrong!

556
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:25,640
Yu-jin!

557
00:47:51,470 --> 00:47:52,470
Yu-jin!

558
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:06,510
You jerk! Come here!

559
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:08,900
Get over here!

560
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:12,020
Mr. Yuk, wait a minute...

561
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:16,000
Yu-jin!

562
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:20,020
You pervert!

563
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:22,870
A teacher installs a spy cam?

564
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:27,000
What were you going to do
after kidnapping her?

565
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:28,990
I'm so sorry.

566
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:31,020
Please don't report me.

567
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:32,410
Look at this jerk.

568
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:36,430
Why do you have Su-yeon's phone?

569
00:48:36,810 --> 00:48:38,450
Did you do something to her?

570
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:42,210
- That's not it!
- Don't you lie to me,

571
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:44,560
should I call the police?

572
00:48:44,610 --> 00:48:46,190
No, please.

573
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:51,030
I'll tell you the truth.

574
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:56,220
She called me that night

575
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:59,620
so I went to pick her up.

576
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:03,380
Su-yeon, are you okay?

577
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,040
Okay.

578
00:50:01,890 --> 00:50:04,890
Mr. Kim, you go on ahead.

579
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:08,530
Someone's picking me up.

580
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:11,660
Who?

581
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:12,980
Someone...

582
00:50:13,990 --> 00:50:16,710
Don't worry, you can go.

583
00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:18,980
Thank you.

584
00:50:53,610 --> 00:50:55,650
I dropped her off and was leaving...

585
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:59,000
But I was worried, so I went back.

586
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:06,580
Su-yeon?

587
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,000
Su-yeon?

588
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:13,810
Are you in here?

589
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:19,840
Su-yeon?

590
00:51:42,830 --> 00:51:45,760
So you found it there?
You expect me to believe that?

591
00:51:45,810 --> 00:51:47,100
It's the truth.

592
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:50,100
I haven't seen her since then.

593
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:51,890
Why didn't you report right away?

594
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:57,980
Being a recent hire,
I didn't want to stir anything up,

595
00:51:58,090 --> 00:52:01,570
you know perfectly well
what that's like.

596
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:04,080
What a jerk...

597
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:10,000
I liked her in a pure way.

598
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:12,440
Why is that a problem?

599
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,440
Are you nuts? In a pure way?

600
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:18,280
You're out of your mind!
She's a minor!

601
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,960
Didn't you try to kidnap Yu-jin
last night?

602
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:24,720
I had drinks with Vice Principal
last night!

603
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:28,000
I'm telling you the truth.

604
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:30,560
Check it out for yourself.

605
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:35,320
Even so, you need a real beating.

606
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,320
- But sir...
- Be quiet.

607
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:38,440
Hello?

608
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:40,560
This is the police!

609
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,000
We got a report!

610
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:45,120
Darn it!

611
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,760
I made the report.

612
00:52:57,490 --> 00:53:00,480
There's definitely something wrong
with him.

613
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,640
He's too suspicious,
a girl's gone too.

614
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,560
Okay, sure, we'll look into it.

615
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:09,090
You got to look into her phone,
track down the last caller...

616
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:13,600
I said we'll look into it!

617
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:15,760
You better head home.

618
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:22,360
Could you do it properly?
Don't just say you will.

619
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,360
Sure thing, good bye.

620
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:26,760
Ma'am, this way.

621
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:27,960
Yes, chief.

622
00:53:31,190 --> 00:53:32,350
Yes, I understand.

623
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:36,200
Could you leave? You're in the way.

624
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:43,760
Coach.

625
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:48,800
The evidence was submitted,
so they'll open a case.

626
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:51,360
When the phone's fixed,

627
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:54,080
find out who the last caller was.

628
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:58,040
Coach, I can't really disclose
any case details.

629
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,720
I'm her teacher, I have to know.

630
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,920
You're really putting me in a spot.

631
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:04,920
Did you file the missing person?

632
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,960
Well, not yet...

633
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:08,320
Not yet?

634
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:12,600
It's the election season,
it's out of my hands.

635
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:14,400
What's with you all?

636
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:16,490
You're going about the wrong way!

637
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:18,400
I know that!

638
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:22,840
I got to go on a patrol,
I'll call you later.

639
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:28,250
Hey, is this the only one?

640
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:32,440
Did you plant them anywhere else?

641
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:35,640
<i>Kim Ki-tae</i>

642
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:40,680
Buddy! Am I boring you?

643
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:50,800
Hello, detective.

644
00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:53,090
How did you like the new batch?

645
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:55,060
I didn't call you about that,

646
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:56,900
we managed to stop
the missing person case,

647
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:01,240
but that jerk brought
in a piece of evidence.

648
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:05,400
It's turning into a major headache.

649
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,840
Welcome, Mr. Chairman.

650
00:55:16,130 --> 00:55:17,800
Evening, sir.

651
00:55:18,930 --> 00:55:19,760
Hello, chief.

652
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:22,440
- And the congressman?
- He'll be here shortly.

653
00:55:22,670 --> 00:55:23,830
Thank you for coming.

654
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:24,800
Mr. Chairman,

655
00:55:26,050 --> 00:55:27,410
we have a situation.

656
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,680
This is your best

657
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:35,840
during this sensitive period?

658
00:55:38,650 --> 00:55:40,050
Do it right.

659
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:41,400
Yes, sir.

660
00:55:45,190 --> 00:55:47,830
What is it? Something wrong?

661
00:55:50,830 --> 00:55:54,630
Seok-jae, we got a problem.

662
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:19,620
...dead last.
And again for the mid-terms.

663
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:22,320
Don't worry,
I'll get them to a Seoul university...

664
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:23,560
Vice Principal!

665
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:25,500
The art teacher is up
on the online bulletin board.

666
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:28,520
- That's indeed him!
- Is she from our school?

667
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,530
3rd year, Han Su-yeon.

668
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:32,160
This could be all made up.

669
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,320
Wait a minute,

670
00:56:33,410 --> 00:56:36,750
- spy cam in girls washroom?
- My gosh...

671
00:56:36,830 --> 00:56:38,260
This could be a prank.

672
00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:40,510
- I didn't see him like that.
- This can't be.

673
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:41,940
Who put this up?

674
00:56:41,970 --> 00:56:44,720
How could you be so irresponsible?

675
00:56:44,970 --> 00:56:48,400
It doesn't matter,
I'm doing everything I can.

676
00:56:48,510 --> 00:56:52,110
You got to graduate,
you'll regret this later.

677
00:56:53,050 --> 00:56:54,010
I know.

678
00:56:54,390 --> 00:56:55,430
Jeeze...

679
00:56:57,120 --> 00:57:00,290
You're too young
to understand the world.

680
00:57:00,330 --> 00:57:02,270
Sir, I'm all grown up.

681
00:57:03,270 --> 00:57:05,590
I just have to age.

682
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:21,280
We were in a rush to hire someone,

683
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:25,580
and didn't do all due process.

684
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:28,030
I don't quite understand, sir.

685
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:30,960
My apologies to you, Mr. Yuk.

686
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:36,030
We'll return the school
development fund you paid.

687
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:44,100
I've added severance
and moving fee costs.

688
00:57:50,070 --> 00:57:53,520
I hope you don't feel too bad
about it.

689
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:59,800
You don't want to cause problems
to each other, no?

690
00:58:03,330 --> 00:58:05,810
This is good for everyone.

691
00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:34,950
Ki-chul, that was...

692
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:37,310
our savings

693
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:41,560
and a loan from dad.

694
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:45,480
Knowing you, I didn't tell you.

695
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:49,620
But Ki-chul,

696
00:58:51,550 --> 00:58:53,510
everyone lives that way.

697
00:59:02,390 --> 00:59:03,350
Yeah, Dong-su.

698
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:08,520
Coach, I just received a report.

699
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,220
Could you step back?

700
00:59:52,150 --> 00:59:53,870
It's Han Su-yeon.

701
00:59:57,910 --> 00:59:59,670
I don't believe this.

702
01:00:45,490 --> 01:00:46,850
Su-yeon...

703
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:48,480
Wait a minute!

704
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:49,600
Yu-jin!

705
01:00:53,090 --> 01:00:54,290
Su-yeon!

706
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:58,280
Su-yeon!

707
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:05,420
Let go of me!

708
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:08,420
Yu-jin!

709
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:23,530
<i>Missing Person</i>

710
01:02:14,170 --> 01:02:17,140
We fended off the reporters today
but it won't be so easy later.

711
01:02:19,050 --> 01:02:20,690
Call the station chief.

712
01:02:21,090 --> 01:02:24,270
He's bloodthirsty for money lately.

713
01:02:24,470 --> 01:02:25,640
That jerk...

714
01:02:39,650 --> 01:02:41,610
Jin-su, it's me.

715
01:02:41,910 --> 01:02:44,290
Remember the phone evidence
brought in yesterday?

716
01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:46,700
What?

717
01:02:50,910 --> 01:02:52,510
Granny!

718
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:55,580
Granny...

719
01:02:55,670 --> 01:02:57,430
Hi, Yu-jin...

720
01:03:56,020 --> 01:03:57,300
That's Dong-su.

721
01:04:00,060 --> 01:04:01,260
What do we do with him?

722
01:04:01,570 --> 01:04:03,730
Stupid idiot...

723
01:04:03,860 --> 01:04:05,140
Hold on.

724
01:04:08,910 --> 01:04:14,110
This is more than
just reassigning a few men.

725
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:17,550
My neck is on the line here.

726
01:04:18,710 --> 01:04:22,790
Who got your job
as the chief of police?

727
01:04:24,170 --> 01:04:28,210
Who lobbied your bosses for you?

728
01:04:28,550 --> 01:04:29,506
The thing is...

729
01:04:29,530 --> 01:04:31,310
When I'm implicated,

730
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:34,530
who do you think will fall?

731
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:39,240
Seok-jae.

732
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:44,260
Yup, it's working.

733
01:04:48,450 --> 01:04:50,520
Boss

734
01:04:52,070 --> 01:04:53,430
Eh? Janus boss?

735
01:04:53,660 --> 01:04:54,370
Yes.

736
01:04:54,620 --> 01:04:58,700
And she texted a woman
named Iseul that night.

737
01:04:59,370 --> 01:05:00,810
She's the madame there.

738
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:03,040
I don't know what happened,

739
01:05:03,340 --> 01:05:06,180
but she texted Su-yeon
that she was worried.

740
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:09,130
Coach, I'll look into it further
and call you back.

741
01:05:09,220 --> 01:05:10,060
Okay, thanks.

742
01:05:10,180 --> 01:05:11,100
Sure.

743
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:24,370
Yu-jin, I got somewhere to be,

744
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:26,780
take good care of her.

745
01:05:27,030 --> 01:05:28,790
Will you be back?

746
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:30,440
I'll be right back.

747
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:34,240
Mr. Yuk.

748
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:50,210
Mr. Chairman, it's time to leave.

749
01:05:53,610 --> 01:05:55,250
Tell him I'll be late.

750
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:16,320
It's me, boss.

751
01:06:16,410 --> 01:06:19,010
That dumb teacher is here.

752
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:21,040
I'll be right there, wait for me.

753
01:06:21,070 --> 01:06:21,770
Of course.

754
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:23,900
This is it, sir.

755
01:06:36,850 --> 01:06:37,970
Madame Iseul?

756
01:06:38,970 --> 01:06:40,130
Could we talk?

757
01:06:40,730 --> 01:06:41,400
What?

758
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:42,410
Just a moment, please.

759
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:52,060
You knew Su-yeon, right?

760
01:06:52,830 --> 01:06:53,940
I don't know anything.

761
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,340
She's dead.

762
01:06:57,250 --> 01:06:58,390
Madame Iseul,

763
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:01,840
You can't pretend to be
ignorant anymore.

764
01:07:04,490 --> 01:07:07,370
Please tell me,
what happened that night?

765
01:07:10,850 --> 01:07:12,410
That night...

766
01:07:30,610 --> 01:07:33,160
Commissioner, have a drink

767
01:07:33,330 --> 01:07:34,770
and take it easy today.

768
01:07:34,850 --> 01:07:36,970
You'll reach high places,

769
01:07:37,090 --> 01:07:39,210
I'm not worthy of your attention.

770
01:07:39,330 --> 01:07:41,440
Only with your help.

771
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:44,410
There isn't much I can do.

772
01:07:49,250 --> 01:07:50,770
Thank you for everything!

773
01:07:53,090 --> 01:07:55,290
I'm going to go to the washroom.

774
01:07:59,570 --> 01:08:00,970
Are you sick?

775
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:06,580
Where does it hurt?

776
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:13,640
Okay, I'll be there soon, wait for me.

777
01:08:15,110 --> 01:08:16,690
Why aren't you coming in?

778
01:08:17,450 --> 01:08:19,090
Did you cry?

779
01:08:31,590 --> 01:08:32,750
Could you...

780
01:08:34,420 --> 01:08:37,180
Could you help me, Mr. Chairman?

781
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:39,400
You know me?

782
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:42,830
I'm actually a student
from Suhwa High.

783
01:08:43,470 --> 01:08:47,150
My grandma is really sick,
may I leave early?

784
01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:53,630
What are you doing here?

785
01:08:54,050 --> 01:08:55,810
Let's go.

786
01:08:57,280 --> 01:08:58,860
Are you out of your mind?

787
01:08:59,030 --> 01:09:01,070
How could you recruit from my school?

788
01:09:01,980 --> 01:09:05,370
We were bringing
in really young girls...

789
01:09:09,370 --> 01:09:10,210
I'm sorry, sir.

790
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:12,300
What if she mentions something
at school?

791
01:09:12,670 --> 01:09:14,670
I'll keep her mouth shut.

792
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:17,310
Her parents had a debt with us,

793
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:19,440
she won't be careless.

794
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:31,020
Commissioner, are you okay?

795
01:09:41,610 --> 01:09:44,730
Chae-lim, where are you? Are you hurt?

796
01:09:47,410 --> 01:09:48,850
Tell me where you are!

797
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:50,400
You tramp,

798
01:09:50,460 --> 01:09:52,370
should I ask your granny at home?

799
01:09:54,910 --> 01:09:55,730
Where?

800
01:09:59,010 --> 01:10:02,970
Got it, don't move a muscle,
I'll be right there.

801
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,200
You go on ahead.

802
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:11,680
So Gwak was the last one
to see Su-yeon alive?

803
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:14,700
He hung up and left right away.

804
01:10:15,820 --> 01:10:17,620
That's all I know.

805
01:10:19,290 --> 01:10:22,650
He's a rat in a pot, search slowly.

806
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:27,120
Stop causing problems
in someone else's town!

807
01:10:28,540 --> 01:10:29,970
Stop right there.

808
01:10:32,710 --> 01:10:34,160
Are you Gwak?

809
01:10:34,830 --> 01:10:36,990
You were right here?

810
01:10:37,060 --> 01:10:38,250
Can we chat?

811
01:10:41,970 --> 01:10:44,580
- Boss, should I take him outside?
- I came for a short chat.

812
01:11:50,330 --> 01:11:52,130
Did you kill Su-yeon?

813
01:11:56,250 --> 01:11:58,370
Did you kill her?

814
01:11:58,580 --> 01:12:00,660
I didn't kill her.

815
01:12:01,090 --> 01:12:02,530
Then who did?

816
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:05,380
Who killed her?

817
01:12:06,050 --> 01:12:07,990
Look, it wasn't me!

818
01:12:17,230 --> 01:12:19,070
Where's that chick?

819
01:12:32,910 --> 01:12:34,110
Tramp!

820
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:36,710
Where are you?

821
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:38,950
I've had it with this chick.

822
01:12:40,330 --> 01:12:41,450
Right here?

823
01:12:44,670 --> 01:12:46,230
Gosh darn it...

824
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:52,240
If you don't want to die,
you better come out.

825
01:12:59,980 --> 01:13:01,300
Are you in here?

826
01:13:17,790 --> 01:13:18,950
Who are you?

827
01:13:45,450 --> 01:13:47,290
Holy cow...

828
01:13:49,740 --> 01:13:51,820
You better come over here.

829
01:13:52,030 --> 01:13:53,310
What's going on?

830
01:13:53,370 --> 01:13:55,170
It's about...

831
01:13:56,490 --> 01:13:57,450
your son.

832
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:58,540
Son?

833
01:14:03,460 --> 01:14:06,500
Coach, someone took the phone.

834
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:08,360
Something's really off.

835
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:10,480
You know that art teacher?

836
01:14:10,670 --> 01:14:13,070
He was released last night.

837
01:14:43,580 --> 01:14:45,100
Mr. Kim?

838
01:14:50,260 --> 01:14:51,300
You're awake?

839
01:14:56,890 --> 01:14:57,890
Yes, Mrs. Kang.

840
01:14:57,970 --> 01:15:01,570
Are you with Yu-jin by any chance?

841
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:03,040
Isn't she at the hospital?

842
01:15:03,150 --> 01:15:07,340
I just got here and she's not here,
her phone's off too.

843
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:08,280
What?

844
01:15:09,190 --> 01:15:10,310
Yu-jin.

845
01:15:10,690 --> 01:15:13,090
I think you misunderstood about me.

846
01:15:14,530 --> 01:15:17,090
I'm not like my dad.

847
01:15:40,530 --> 01:15:42,010
Where's her phone?

848
01:15:44,890 --> 01:15:46,050
Right here.

849
01:16:04,410 --> 01:16:06,130
Leave us for a moment.

850
01:16:06,250 --> 01:16:07,170
Yes, sir.

851
01:16:09,730 --> 01:16:11,650
No, father!

852
01:16:13,340 --> 01:16:15,010
I didn't know she was dead...

853
01:16:21,370 --> 01:16:22,610
Ji-sung.

854
01:16:24,010 --> 01:16:26,330
Have I done something wrong to you?

855
01:16:28,010 --> 01:16:33,650
I've worked so hard to make you a man.

856
01:16:39,850 --> 01:16:41,850
I'm sorry, father, I'm so sorry!

857
01:16:42,930 --> 01:16:44,210
Father! Please!

858
01:16:44,330 --> 01:16:45,330
On your feet!

859
01:16:45,610 --> 01:16:46,970
Stand up straight!

860
01:16:48,230 --> 01:16:49,850
Do it right!

861
01:17:07,250 --> 01:17:09,090
Don't be scared, Yu-jin.

862
01:17:30,330 --> 01:17:31,530
Yu-jin!

863
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:32,670
Yu-jin!

864
01:17:32,770 --> 01:17:34,490
Don't make a sound, I'll kill you too!

865
01:17:56,570 --> 01:17:59,930
Why didn't you answer your phone?

866
01:18:19,370 --> 01:18:21,250
Jingye-ri county 22-1...

867
01:18:22,130 --> 01:18:23,770
22-1!

868
01:18:25,050 --> 01:18:26,930
What's all this?

869
01:18:27,470 --> 01:18:31,590
Bastard, this is why
you were holed up here?

870
01:18:32,660 --> 01:18:35,770
Go back to America.

871
01:18:38,330 --> 01:18:41,650
Father, the semester isn't over,

872
01:18:41,690 --> 01:18:44,900
- the students need...
- Are you desperate to ruin me?

873
01:18:45,470 --> 01:18:48,170
Stay there until things cool down!

874
01:18:51,580 --> 01:18:54,020
There are students who rely on me...

875
01:18:56,170 --> 01:19:00,800
I even cleaned up your mess
by killing her, yet you won't listen?

876
01:19:03,510 --> 01:19:05,210
So why did you kill her?

877
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:07,480
Help me...

878
01:19:08,970 --> 01:19:10,850
Please help...

879
01:19:21,780 --> 01:19:23,460
Mr. Chairman...

880
01:19:26,130 --> 01:19:27,410
Mr. Kim...

881
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:41,770
I won't tell anyone...

882
01:19:43,090 --> 01:19:44,530
Please help...

883
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:45,960
Good.

884
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:50,000
You shouldn't tell anyone.

885
01:20:18,690 --> 01:20:19,790
What?

886
01:20:20,710 --> 01:20:22,950
You stupid jerk! It was for you!

887
01:20:24,220 --> 01:20:26,190
Why was that for me?

888
01:20:26,550 --> 01:20:28,390
I've had it!

889
01:20:32,910 --> 01:20:35,890
Stand up straight, you ungrateful!

890
01:20:38,850 --> 01:20:40,406
Why are you doing this?

891
01:20:40,430 --> 01:20:42,150
Please! Father!

892
01:20:54,630 --> 01:20:56,230
Please!

893
01:20:59,980 --> 01:21:01,990
Just do what I tell you!

894
01:21:28,670 --> 01:21:30,150
Hello, commissioner.

895
01:21:31,350 --> 01:21:32,790
I'm on my way.

896
01:21:33,870 --> 01:21:34,870
Yes, sir.

897
01:21:38,230 --> 01:21:41,550
Get ready to fly out,
I'll send someone tomorrow.

898
01:21:49,230 --> 01:21:50,790
Stupid idiot...

899
01:21:52,830 --> 01:21:55,150
Who did he take after?

900
01:21:59,110 --> 01:22:00,310
He's on his way.

901
01:22:00,430 --> 01:22:01,830
- Is that so?
- Yes.

902
01:22:02,470 --> 01:22:05,430
Let's get ready, everyone.

903
01:22:09,510 --> 01:22:10,590
Yu-jin.

904
01:22:13,390 --> 01:22:15,030
You can come out now.

905
01:22:23,790 --> 01:22:24,830
Yu-jin!

906
01:22:32,510 --> 01:22:33,790
Yu-jin!

907
01:22:58,390 --> 01:23:00,950
Why are you doing this to me?

908
01:23:30,670 --> 01:23:31,710
Yu-jin.

909
01:23:34,990 --> 01:23:37,520
Why are you making me into a bad guy?

910
01:23:51,670 --> 01:23:53,870
You can't escape no matter what.

911
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:35,670
Come on out now.

912
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:05,200
Yu-jin!

913
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:08,240
Yu-jin!

914
01:25:08,870 --> 01:25:10,230
Are you in there?

915
01:25:17,030 --> 01:25:17,950
Yu-jin!

916
01:25:21,140 --> 01:25:22,060
Yu-jin!

917
01:25:22,180 --> 01:25:23,780
Wake up! Yu-jin!

918
01:25:42,530 --> 01:25:43,810
Yu-jin, wake up!

919
01:26:05,390 --> 01:26:07,310
You son of a gun...

920
01:26:17,610 --> 01:26:18,530
Come here!

921
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:21,560
Don't kill me...

922
01:26:25,370 --> 01:26:26,570
Please...

923
01:26:27,290 --> 01:26:28,930
I'm so sorry.

924
01:26:37,420 --> 01:26:38,940
Yu-jin! Yu-jin!

925
01:26:44,020 --> 01:26:45,420
Hold on!

926
01:27:35,220 --> 01:27:40,140
Tallying is under way
with Kim Ki-tae tailing behind.

927
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:43,680
That jerk's poking around everywhere,

928
01:27:43,780 --> 01:27:46,660
send out an APB and find him!

929
01:28:06,740 --> 01:28:07,580
Yu-jin!

930
01:28:07,700 --> 01:28:09,860
Yu-jin, you got to wake up!

931
01:28:09,980 --> 01:28:12,340
Don't fall asleep, okay?

932
01:28:20,660 --> 01:28:22,780
Governorship of Kochun

933
01:28:50,140 --> 01:28:51,300
Mr. Yuk...

934
01:28:51,780 --> 01:28:53,260
I'm right here!

935
01:28:54,060 --> 01:28:57,700
The one who killed Su-yeon...

936
01:28:59,020 --> 01:29:00,740
was Chairman Kim.

937
01:29:52,380 --> 01:29:57,060
<i>Elected: Kim Ki-tae</i>

938
01:30:34,910 --> 01:30:38,110
Kim Ki-tae! Kim Ki-tae!

939
01:30:38,250 --> 01:30:41,630
Kim Ki-tae! Kim Ki-tae!

940
01:30:44,380 --> 01:30:46,060
Hello, Commissioner.

941
01:30:46,550 --> 01:30:49,550
Call me Governor Kim.

942
01:30:50,930 --> 01:30:53,090
This is all thanks to you.

943
01:30:54,430 --> 01:30:56,850
Let's all get together for a drink.

944
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:21,160
Ow, my head...

945
01:31:24,290 --> 01:31:25,890
What happened?

946
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:39,960
That crazy jerk!

947
01:31:40,060 --> 01:31:41,180
Stop him!

948
01:31:41,310 --> 01:31:42,190
Yes, sir!

949
01:31:44,100 --> 01:31:46,700
Who the heck are you?

950
01:31:49,650 --> 01:31:51,490
Son of a gun!

951
01:31:52,450 --> 01:31:53,890
You jerk!

952
01:31:54,360 --> 01:31:59,960
Do you know who I am?
You're a dead man now!

953
01:32:02,910 --> 01:32:04,510
You better run!

954
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:08,240
You're an absolute jerk! You're done!

955
01:32:08,630 --> 01:32:10,610
I'm a governor, you fool!

956
01:32:10,690 --> 01:32:13,560
You messed with the wrong man!

957
01:32:13,630 --> 01:32:17,340
You're so dead, you stupid jerk!

958
01:32:36,570 --> 01:32:41,010
Chief, thanks for the call,
there's a crazy guy...

959
01:32:43,120 --> 01:32:44,040
What?

960
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:07,440
Governor-elect Kim Ki-tae

961
01:33:07,470 --> 01:33:12,560
is arrested for the murder
of a high school student.

962
01:33:12,900 --> 01:33:16,500
His son and a local gang,

963
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:20,500
police chief and detectives

964
01:33:20,570 --> 01:33:22,130
are also under investigation.

965
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:36,040
You got here
just for all that trouble.

966
01:33:37,010 --> 01:33:38,490
Do your job.

967
01:33:40,050 --> 01:33:41,330
I better.

968
01:33:42,350 --> 01:33:43,790
How's your head?

969
01:33:44,010 --> 01:33:45,170
I'm fine.

970
01:33:45,470 --> 01:33:46,710
Be careful.

971
01:33:48,060 --> 01:33:49,020
I'm off.

972
01:33:49,150 --> 01:33:50,070
Sure thing.

973
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:53,970
Drive safe and call me
if you ever come back.

974
01:33:54,730 --> 01:33:55,850
Sure, take care.

975
01:33:56,530 --> 01:33:59,440
You should get a new car,
it's too small for you.

976
01:33:59,660 --> 01:34:01,060
I'm penniless, you jerk.

977
01:34:01,570 --> 01:34:03,130
So long!
