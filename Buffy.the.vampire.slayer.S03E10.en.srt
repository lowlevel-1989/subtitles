00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,162


1
00:00:02,628 --> 00:00:07,341
The curse. If Angel achieved
true happiness, even just a moment,

2
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:13,388
- he would lose his soul.
- Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":

3
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,808
This is it. The curse.

4
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,394
- What?
- I may be able to work this.

5
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:22,648
Willow cured him
and somehow he came back.

6
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:25,067
You must have known
it was wrong to see Angel.

7
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:27,027
I wanted to wait.

8
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,447
For Angel to go psycho again
the next time you give him a happy?

9
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:12,906
Why, Daniel, wherever are you goin'?

10
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:16,493
- You... you're not human.
- Not of late, no.

11
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:19,663
- What do you want?
- I'm hungry, Daniel.

12
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:23,125
- And seeing as you're in my debt...
- Please, I can't.

13
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:27,337
A man playing at cards should have a
natural intelligence or a great deal of money.

14
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,340
And you're sadly lacking in both.

15
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,470
So I'll take my winnings my own way.

16
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:40,434
The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures...

17
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:42,853
Daniel, be of good cheer.

18
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,898
It's Christmas.

19
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:57,367
It's going to be warm, with temperatures
continuing in the high 70s

20
00:01:57,743 --> 00:01:59,953
throughout the holiday weekend,

21
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:15,594
- Hi.
- Angel.

22
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,142
So, are you shopping?

23
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,977
You're probably not shopping.

24
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,688
I couldn't sleep.

25
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:30,067
Vampires are probably not big
on Christmas, now I think about it.

26
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,110
Not as a rule.

27
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:37,908
But you're good?

28
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:42,246
- I'm all right. You?
- Yeah.

29
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:47,167
Yeah, I'm good. I was just getting
some Christmas gifts for the gang.

30
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,839
I'd better go before the magic store closes.

31
00:02:56,552 --> 00:03:01,265
Angel?

32
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,017
What is it?

33
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:10,834
And then he just bailed. He didn't say
anything, he just took off. It was so weird.

34
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:14,421
Angel? Weird? What are the odds?

35
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:18,592
Do you think something's wrong?
Maybe you should tell Giles.

36
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:22,179
No. I don't wanna bug Giles.

37
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:25,265
He's still kinda twitchy
on the subject of Angel.

38
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:28,894
Must be that Angel-killed-his
girlfriend-and-tortured-him thing.

39
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:31,563
Giles is pretty petty with stuff like that.

40
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,857
Xander, enough. OK?

41
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:36,693
Maybe Angel just has the holiday blues.

42
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:41,073
Everybody gets 'em,
especially when they're alone.

43
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:43,534
It's just so frustrating.

44
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:47,579
I'm trying to do the right thing
and stay away from him and get over it.

45
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:50,833
And then boom, there he is.

46
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,212
I just want a nice, quiet Christmas vacation.

47
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,632
So, you doing anything special?

48
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:01,301
Tree. Nog. Roast beast.

49
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,847
Just me and mom
and hopefully an excess of gifts.

50
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,975
- What are you doing for Christmas?
- Being Jewish. Remember?

51
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:10,227
Not everybody worships Santa.

52
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:14,189
- I just meant for vacation.
- Oh, nothing fun.

53
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,859
Oz and I had planned...

54
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:20,195
But I guess that's off.

55
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:24,283
Well, I'll be enjoying
my annual Christmas Eve camp-out.

56
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:27,369
I take my sleeping bag outside
and sleep on the grass.

57
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:31,456
- Sounds fun.
- Yeah. I look at the stars, feel the nature vibe.

58
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,627
I thought you slept outside to avoid
your family's drunken Christmas fights.

59
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:41,008
Yes, and that was a confidence
I was hoping you'd share with everyone.

60
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:44,553
Well, I'll be in Aspen. Skiing.

61
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:47,973
- With actual snow.
- I hear that helps.

62
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:52,436
It must be a drag to be stuck here
in Sweatydale, but I'm thinking of you.

63
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,397
OK, I'm done.

64
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,110
- She certainly has reverted to form.
- It's not her fault.

65
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:03,280
After what happened,
we gotta cut her some slack.

66
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:06,783
- That's the Christmas spirit.
- Hello? Still Jewish.

67
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,786
Chanukah spirit, I believe that was.

68
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:15,042
Anyway, forgiveness is pretty much a big
theme with me this year because of the...

69
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,716
Hey.

70
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:26,512
OK.

71
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,931
The thing is...

72
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:32,809
Seeing you with Xander, it was...

73
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:38,357
Well, I never felt that way before -

74
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:40,817
when there wasn't a full moon.

75
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:43,362
But I know you guys have a history.

76
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:46,365
But it's a history that's in the past.

77
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:50,077
Well, I guess most history is in the past.

78
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:52,704
But it's over.

79
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:59,378
Well, I don't know. I don't know
that it ever will be between you two.

80
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:01,922
Oz, please believe me.

81
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,591
This is what I do know.

82
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,971
I miss you.

83
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:12,099
Like, every second.

84
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:15,978
It's like I lost an arm.

85
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,355
Or worse, a torso.

86
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:23,193
So...

87
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:26,697
I think I'd be willing to give it a shot.

88
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,996
Really?

89
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:40,002
Yeah.

90
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:46,675
Do you want us to...

91
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:48,886
to hug now?

92
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:52,306
Yeah, I'm good for that.

93
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:16,788
D'you wanna get one with snow on it?

94
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,166
Be very Christmassy.

95
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:22,169
- I think those are just for display.
- Oh.

96
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:24,922
You know, honey, I was thinking.

97
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:28,509
Maybe we should invite Faith
to spend Christmas Eve with us.

98
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:30,844
I don't know.

99
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,347
Faith and I don't really hang out,

100
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:36,600
or talk, or make eye contact lately.

101
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,980
Do you really wanna let her spend Christmas
Eve all by herself in that dingy motel room?

102
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:46,860
- You're still number one with the guilt trip.
- I try.

103
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:52,449
- I'll ask her.
- You're a doll.

104
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:55,702
- What about Giles? He doesn't have...
- I'm sure he's fine.

105
00:08:55,869 --> 00:09:00,123
- We could at least ask him and see.
- He doesn't wanna be with a bunch of girls.

106
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,709
Let's split up.

107
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:34,741
Bunch of 'em up and died on us.
Don't know why.

108
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:37,744
If you want one,
I can make you a hell of a deal.

109
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:39,663
No, thank you.

110
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:41,665
Oh, honey, this one's perfect.

111
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:10,402
Yeah?

112
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:16,241
Work, dammit!

113
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:18,243
Hey.

114
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,373
What's goin' on? Scary monsters?

115
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:25,375
Nope.

116
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:33,800
We're having Christmas Eve dinner
at my house, and if you didn't have plans...

117
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:36,595
Your mom sent you down, huh?

118
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,641
- No.
- Well, thanks, but I got plans.

119
00:10:42,226 --> 00:10:44,561
There's this big party I've been invited to.

120
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:46,230
It should be a blast.

121
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:48,440
OK. Cool.

122
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:52,528
But if you change your mind, the offer...

123
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:54,738
It's nice of you, thanks,

124
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:59,826
but I got... I got that big party
that I've been invited to, so...

125
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:09,920
I like the lights.

126
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:13,841
Yeah, well, 'tis the season.
Whatever that means.

127
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:22,224
Just a minute!

128
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:30,399
Hello.

129
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,067
I'm...

130
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:34,736
I'm sorry to bother you.

131
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:43,287
Sorry. Coming from you, that phrase strikes
me as rather funny: sorry to bother me.

132
00:11:44,163 --> 00:11:46,456
- I need your help.
- And the funny keeps on coming.

133
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:49,209
I understand I have no right to ask for it,

134
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:51,920
but there's no one else.

135
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:57,259
All right.

136
00:12:02,306 --> 00:12:04,516
I can't come in unless you invite me.

137
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:07,436
I'm aware of that.

138
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:11,899
Come in.

139
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:21,783
I've been seeing...

140
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:26,830
I've had dreams lately. About the past.

141
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:31,543
It's like I'm living it again, it's so vivid.

142
00:12:32,336 --> 00:12:34,171
I need to know...

143
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:38,425
- I need to know why I'm here.
- Here? Back on earth?

144
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:43,430
I should be in a demon dimension
and suffering an eternity of torture.

145
00:12:44,223 --> 00:12:48,435
- I don't feel inclined to argue with that.
- But I'm not.

146
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:50,812
I was freed. And I don't understand why.

147
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:55,651
- Knowing would give you peace of mind?
- It might.

148
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,195
Is that something you ought to have?

149
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:04,326
Because, to be blunt, the last time you
became complacent about your existence,

150
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:07,079
it turned out rather badly.

151
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:11,542
What?

152
00:13:14,253 --> 00:13:15,963
Don't you see her?

153
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,798
Who?

154
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:24,847
I can't.

155
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:41,738
I propose a toast.

156
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:50,080
Well, it's nice to be back in London.

157
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,046
Please, I should return to the party.

158
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:01,675
- Margaret, there's no hurry.
- Mistress will be wondering...

159
00:14:02,426 --> 00:14:05,345
She'll be wondering how to get
Reverend Chalmers into bed,

160
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,891
and will not notice the absence of canapés.

161
00:14:09,308 --> 00:14:12,769
- Stay with me.
- Sir, people might talk.

162
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:16,690
I'll be put out in the streets.
My little boy would...

163
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:21,028
I can't lose this job.

164
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,948
- Then you best keep quiet.
- You're hurting me.

165
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:30,078
Cry out, call for help. I'm sure Mistress will
believe your behaviour beyond reproach.

166
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:32,498
- Please.
- Come.

167
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:35,375
Make a scene, shall I?

168
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:40,088
No.

169
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:45,928
We'll be as quiet as mice.

170
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,852
No matter what.

171
00:14:54,353 --> 00:14:55,729
Sir.

172
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,898
My son!

173
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:00,400
He'll make a fine dessert.

174
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:33,225
Trouble sleeping?

175
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,104
- You're not here.
- I'm always here.

176
00:15:40,065 --> 00:15:42,985
- Leave me alone.
- I can't.

177
00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:45,571
You won't let me.

178
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:50,951
What do you want?

179
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:56,290
To die in bed surrounded by grandchildren,
but I guess that's off the menu.

180
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:58,792
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry.

181
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,920
For me? Don't bother.

182
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:03,797
I'm dead. I'm over it.

183
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:10,554
If you wanna feel sorry for someone,
feel sorry for yourself.

184
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:15,058
- But I guess you've already got that covered.
- Look, I am sorry

185
00:16:15,726 --> 00:16:17,895
for what I've done.

186
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:20,439
What else can I say to you?

187
00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:26,236
I don't wanna make you feel bad.

188
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:30,824
I just want to show you who you are.

189
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:34,828
- You had a dream about Angel.
- I was in Angel's dream.

190
00:16:35,746 --> 00:16:39,416
- I'm not sure that's...
- There was stuff I couldn't possibly know.

191
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:44,004
It was Angel's past. He was dreaming it
and somehow I got sucked in.

192
00:16:45,756 --> 00:16:48,008
There's something wrong with him.

193
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:53,222
I know. I've seen him.

194
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:58,268
He wanted to know why he was back.

195
00:16:58,268 --> 00:17:00,479
Is there away for us to find that out?

196
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:06,109
- Possibly. I've been looking.
- Well, let me look, too.

197
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:12,533
I'm not seeing him any more.
I'm trying to put all this behind me.

198
00:17:12,658 --> 00:17:17,329
And I won't be able to as long as we're doing
guest spots in each other's dreams.

199
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,543
So we'll help him?

200
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,379
Yes.

201
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:28,882
Where do we start?

202
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:36,181
I'm aware I haven't been the mostest best
friend to you when it comes to Angel, and...

203
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:40,394
I don't know, maybe
I've finally got the Chanukah spirit.

204
00:17:40,811 --> 00:17:43,856
Well, we start, unsurprisingly, with research.

205
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:48,402
Xander -

206
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:50,195
Black Chronicles,

207
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:54,908
And, Buffy - the Diary of Lucius Temple,
An acolyte of Acathla, an expert on demons.

208
00:17:55,826 --> 00:18:00,789
You can skip the passages on his garden,
unless you're keen on growing heartier beets.

209
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:04,877
Are you sure this is how
you wanna spend your vacation?

210
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:10,132
It's the most exciting thing I've got planned.
Who else can claim that pathetic a social life?

211
00:18:10,841 --> 00:18:13,051
Hey, guys. What're we doin'?

212
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:32,779
He's gonna come over on Christmas Eve
cos my parents are out of town.

213
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:36,658
- We're gonna watch videos.
- That's good, right?

214
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:39,244
You guys are back.

215
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,872
It's good. It's perfect.

216
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:45,250
In an awkward, uncomfortable sort of way.

217
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:50,380
I just don't know how to make Oz trust me.

218
00:18:51,507 --> 00:18:54,384
Xander has a piece of you
that Oz just can't touch.

219
00:18:55,886 --> 00:18:59,181
I guess now it's just about
showing Oz that he comes first.

220
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:04,019
I guess.

221
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:05,687
Thanks.

222
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:10,484
- Hey! He likes beets.
- I read that one already.

223
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:13,278
We're not getting any closer.

224
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:20,494
The thing I remember most
was thinking how artful it was.

225
00:19:21,912 --> 00:19:26,083
In the dark they looked
just like they were sleeping.

226
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:31,672
It wasn't until I bent down and kissed them
good night that I felt how cold they were.

227
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:35,342
You grabbed me and I thought:

228
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:39,763
"Who would go to so much trouble
to arrange them like that?"

229
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:44,268
But you see...

230
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:47,354
That's what makes you
different than other beasts.

231
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:49,940
They kill to feed.

232
00:19:50,065 --> 00:19:55,112
But you took more kinds of pleasure in it
than any creature that walks or crawls.

233
00:19:55,696 --> 00:19:57,739
- Oh, God.
- Yeah.

234
00:19:58,198 --> 00:20:00,951
Cry out. Make a scene.

235
00:20:02,578 --> 00:20:06,540
I was to be married that week,
but then, as I recall, you knew that.

236
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,293
- It wasn't me.
- It wasn't you?

237
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:11,795
A demon isn't a man. I was a man once.

238
00:20:12,588 --> 00:20:15,340
Oh, yes. And what a man you were.

239
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:23,682
A drunken, whoring layabout

240
00:20:23,849 --> 00:20:27,019
and a terrible disappointment
to your parents.

241
00:20:27,603 --> 00:20:29,813
I was young.

242
00:20:30,105 --> 00:20:33,275
- I never had a chance to...
- To die of syphilis?

243
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:36,862
You were a worthless being
before you were ever a monster.

244
00:20:36,987 --> 00:20:39,198
Stop it!

245
00:20:41,992 --> 00:20:46,038
I don't wanna hurt you, Angel,
but you have to understand.

246
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:50,959
Cruelty is the only thing
you ever had a true talent for.

247
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:53,086
It's not true.

248
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:55,547
Rest.

249
00:21:03,889 --> 00:21:07,017
You mistake it for a curse, Angel, but it's not.

250
00:21:08,894 --> 00:21:10,729
It's your destiny.

251
00:21:14,525 --> 00:21:16,360
I'll show you.

252
00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:13,101
- You want her.
- No.

253
00:23:13,477 --> 00:23:16,146
Take her. Take what you want.

254
00:23:17,231 --> 00:23:21,944
Pour all that frustration
and all that guilt into her and you'll be free.

255
00:23:22,861 --> 00:23:24,530
No.

256
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:28,909
You can't live for eternity with all that pain.

257
00:23:30,369 --> 00:23:33,455
This is what you are
and this is why we brought you back.

258
00:23:34,748 --> 00:23:36,583
Take her.

259
00:23:37,876 --> 00:23:39,628
And then you'll be ready

260
00:23:41,004 --> 00:23:42,840
to kill her.

261
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,475
Hey, Buffy. Take a look.

262
00:23:56,019 --> 00:24:00,399
These letters contain references
to an ancient power known as the First.

263
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,901
- First what?
- Evil.

264
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:05,362
Absolute evil. Older than man, than demons.

265
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:08,907
It could have had the power
to bring Angel back.

266
00:24:09,783 --> 00:24:11,451
These guys.

267
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:14,454
I saw them in my dream. I fell asleep up there.

268
00:24:14,788 --> 00:24:16,999
You had another dream? With Angel?

269
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:19,960
What happened?

270
00:24:21,044 --> 00:24:23,255
Oh, we don't need to get sidetracked.

271
00:24:23,547 --> 00:24:28,051
- Who are these guys?
- They're known as Bringers or Harbingers.

272
00:24:28,552 --> 00:24:30,929
They're high priests of the First.

273
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:35,142
They can conjure spirit manifestation
and set them on people.

274
00:24:35,434 --> 00:24:38,812
- Influence them, haunt them.
- These guys are working the mojo on Angel.

275
00:24:39,813 --> 00:24:41,648
We gotta stop 'em.

276
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:44,985
You can't fight the First, Buffy.
It's not a physical being.

277
00:24:45,444 --> 00:24:49,489
- Well, I can fight these priest guys.
- If we can find 'em.

278
00:24:57,956 --> 00:25:01,543
It's the Slayer.
What brings the Slayer down here?

279
00:25:05,464 --> 00:25:07,841
Hey, Willy. How you been?

280
00:25:07,966 --> 00:25:11,094
Keeping outta trouble. As God is my witness.

281
00:25:12,346 --> 00:25:15,015
So what can I do for you? Coupla drinks?

282
00:25:15,474 --> 00:25:17,476
Yeah, let me get a double shot of...

283
00:25:19,228 --> 00:25:22,648
- information, pal.
- Three priests. They call themselves...

284
00:25:22,981 --> 00:25:25,484
- The Bringers.
- Bringers. Harbingers.

285
00:25:26,735 --> 00:25:29,404
- They have a no-eyes kind of look.
- Doesn't ring a bell.

286
00:25:30,489 --> 00:25:32,533
How about I ring that bell for ya?

287
00:25:32,991 --> 00:25:36,203
- Does the threatening come now?
- Maybe you shouldn't help.

288
00:25:36,745 --> 00:25:41,875
They'd have come to town recently. They'd be
holed up somewhere, summoning the First.

289
00:25:45,504 --> 00:25:49,550
Well... I heard a few things.
You know - from the underground.

290
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:53,595
- The underground?
- Yeah. From things living under the ground.

291
00:25:54,263 --> 00:25:57,391
There's been migration out of Sunnydale
from the lower inhabitants.

292
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:01,687
Something's scaring them off. And these
are things that are not easily scared.

293
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:04,356
- Could be your priest guys are underground.
- Where?

294
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:06,900
I do not know.

295
00:26:08,652 --> 00:26:09,903
OK.

296
00:26:09,903 --> 00:26:11,989
- Thanks.
- See you around.

297
00:26:13,657 --> 00:26:16,243
You did great, by the way.
I was very intimidated.

298
00:26:16,785 --> 00:26:18,453
Really?

299
00:26:19,913 --> 00:26:21,874
- Thanks.
- Let's go.

300
00:26:22,416 --> 00:26:23,750
Hey, kid.

301
00:26:24,293 --> 00:26:26,295
Merry Christmas.

302
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:39,308
Man, is it hot. It was so nice and cool in there.

303
00:26:39,308 --> 00:26:41,602
Yeah. A nice, cool waste of time.

304
00:26:42,436 --> 00:26:44,313
We know underground, that's a start.

305
00:26:44,313 --> 00:26:46,899
Sure! In a town with
14 million square miles of sewer.

306
00:26:47,441 --> 00:26:50,736
Plus a lot of natural cave formations
and a gateway to hell.

307
00:26:51,195 --> 00:26:55,782
- Yeah, this does resemble square one.
- I don't know what to do.

308
00:26:56,825 --> 00:27:01,413
I think right now the best plan
is to deck the halls with boughs of holly.

309
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:04,708
Look, we'll catch the bad guys -
sooner or later.

310
00:27:11,465 --> 00:27:13,133
Willow?

311
00:27:15,844 --> 00:27:17,387
I got videos.

312
00:27:17,721 --> 00:27:19,181
Hi.

313
00:27:20,224 --> 00:27:22,976
Why don't you come sit down?

314
00:27:44,623 --> 00:27:47,668
Ever have that dream where
you're in a play, and it's the middle,

315
00:27:48,377 --> 00:27:51,797
and you don't know your lines
and you kind of don't know the plot?

316
00:27:52,756 --> 00:27:57,177
Well, we're alone and we're together.

317
00:27:58,387 --> 00:28:00,556
I just wanted it to be special.

318
00:28:01,515 --> 00:28:03,183
How special we talkin'?

319
00:28:04,017 --> 00:28:05,811
Well, you know.

320
00:28:05,894 --> 00:28:11,024
We're alone and we're both
mature younger people,

321
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:14,027
and so...

322
00:28:14,027 --> 00:28:15,696
we could...

323
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:19,408
I'm ready to... with you...

324
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:22,953
We could do that thing.

325
00:28:28,417 --> 00:28:32,379
- Where are you going?
- No, I'm not going. Just a... dramatic gesture.

326
00:28:33,422 --> 00:28:35,257
That's pretty special.

327
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:40,220
Oz, I wanna be with you.

328
00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:42,556
First.

329
00:28:42,806 --> 00:28:45,017
I think we should sit down again.

330
00:28:49,062 --> 00:28:50,898
Oz...

331
00:28:52,191 --> 00:28:54,026
I'm ready.

332
00:28:58,447 --> 00:29:01,450
OK. Well, don't take this the wrong way...

333
00:29:04,077 --> 00:29:05,913
but I'm not.

334
00:29:07,831 --> 00:29:12,044
- Are you scared? Cos I thought you had...
- No, I have.

335
00:29:12,836 --> 00:29:14,671
But this is different.

336
00:29:15,964 --> 00:29:18,008
I mean, you look great.

337
00:29:18,467 --> 00:29:24,765
And you got the Barry working for you,
and it's all... good.

338
00:29:25,974 --> 00:29:28,352
But when it happens...

339
00:29:30,979 --> 00:29:34,650
I want it to be because
we both need it to for the same reason.

340
00:29:37,236 --> 00:29:39,446
You don't have to prove anything to me.

341
00:29:40,989 --> 00:29:42,825
I just wanted you to know.

342
00:29:42,866 --> 00:29:44,910
I know.

343
00:29:45,369 --> 00:29:47,371
I get the message.

344
00:30:00,968 --> 00:30:02,469
There we go.

345
00:30:02,845 --> 00:30:05,597
Nothing like a fire
to keep away the blistering heat.

346
00:30:06,598 --> 00:30:08,475
Oh, come on. It's lovely.

347
00:30:09,726 --> 00:30:12,271
Maybe I should turn the air conditioning on.

348
00:30:15,983 --> 00:30:18,694
- Angel's on top again?
- What?

349
00:30:19,111 --> 00:30:21,446
Angel or star?

350
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:24,992
Star.

351
00:30:35,377 --> 00:30:37,045
Hey.

352
00:30:41,008 --> 00:30:44,511
Looks like that whole party thing
was gonna be kind of a drag.

353
00:30:47,264 --> 00:30:49,600
I didn't really have anything...

354
00:30:49,766 --> 00:30:51,226
You know.

355
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,522
I'm glad you came.

356
00:30:58,525 --> 00:30:59,776
Here.

357
00:31:00,402 --> 00:31:03,530
Why don't you come in
from the entire lack of cold?

358
00:31:06,658 --> 00:31:09,495
That one is for your mom.
They're pretty crappy.

359
00:31:09,786 --> 00:31:11,538
Faith, you made it.

360
00:31:12,915 --> 00:31:15,459
- Oh, that is so thoughtful.
- They're crappy.

361
00:31:16,668 --> 00:31:19,129
I'm gonna go upstairs and get your gifts.

362
00:31:20,422 --> 00:31:21,798
Some nog?

363
00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:25,928
OK, Mom, don't touch yours
cos then you're gonna know what it is.

364
00:31:30,432 --> 00:31:32,267
Angel.

365
00:31:34,186 --> 00:31:35,729
Buffy...

366
00:31:36,063 --> 00:31:37,731
What is it?

367
00:31:41,693 --> 00:31:43,487
I gotta...

368
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:45,948
Look, I had to see you.

369
00:31:49,827 --> 00:31:52,120
I don't know. I...

370
00:31:52,329 --> 00:31:53,956
You shouldn't be...

371
00:31:54,832 --> 00:31:57,292
Just tell me what's going on.

372
00:31:58,585 --> 00:32:01,004
She wants you to touch her.

373
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:04,341
What are you waiting for?

374
00:32:04,842 --> 00:32:07,094
Look, you have to stay away from me.

375
00:32:07,344 --> 00:32:10,722
You came to see me
to tell me that I can't see you?

376
00:32:14,226 --> 00:32:16,436
Angel, something is doing this to you.

377
00:32:19,857 --> 00:32:22,150
You just have to control it, OK?

378
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:25,612
- I know you're confused.
- I think you're the one who's confused.

379
00:32:26,113 --> 00:32:27,656
I think you need to...

380
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:30,033
She wants you to taste her.

381
00:32:31,743 --> 00:32:33,871
Think of the peace.

382
00:32:34,246 --> 00:32:36,540
You'll never have to see us again.

383
00:32:36,748 --> 00:32:39,710
- Angel, how can I help you?
- Leave me alone!

384
00:32:42,546 --> 00:32:44,506
Stay with Mom in case he comes back.

385
00:32:45,048 --> 00:32:47,301
I'll play watchdog. I don't get it, though.

386
00:32:47,551 --> 00:32:52,222
- I'll explain later. Everything, I promise.
- Watch your back.

387
00:32:53,182 --> 00:32:56,018
Giles, we have to do something. Soon. Now.

388
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:58,020
I'm still not sure what.

389
00:32:58,187 --> 00:33:01,398
Find me these priest guys.
Find me something I can pummel.

390
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,693
- Let's not lose our heads.
- Giles, he's slipping.

391
00:33:10,073 --> 00:33:12,284
I think we're losing him.

392
00:33:14,453 --> 00:33:17,623
You realise if he truly becomes a danger,

393
00:33:18,207 --> 00:33:20,125
you may have to kill him.

394
00:33:20,709 --> 00:33:22,336
Again.

395
00:33:24,463 --> 00:33:26,507
Can you do that?

396
00:33:26,965 --> 00:33:29,801
- I can't do it.
- You have to do it.

397
00:33:30,719 --> 00:33:33,013
- What else are you good for?
- Get away from me.

398
00:33:33,222 --> 00:33:35,432
Couldn't you just feel her?

399
00:33:36,975 --> 00:33:39,353
Couldn't you almost smell her skin?

400
00:33:41,355 --> 00:33:44,608
You never were a fighter, Angel.
Don't start tryin' now.

401
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,570
Sooner or later you will drink her.

402
00:33:50,739 --> 00:33:53,909
- I'll never hurt her.
- You must. Have you learned nothing?

403
00:33:54,493 --> 00:33:57,538
- As long as you are alive...
- Then I'll die.

404
00:34:00,123 --> 00:34:04,169
- You don't have the strength to kill yourself.
- I don't need strength.

405
00:34:07,005 --> 00:34:08,841
I just need the sun to rise.

406
00:34:13,887 --> 00:34:16,640
You're not supposed to die.
This isn't the plan.

407
00:34:22,646 --> 00:34:24,189
But it'll do.

408
00:34:29,528 --> 00:34:33,407
"A child shall be born of man and goat
and have two heads,

409
00:34:33,907 --> 00:34:36,493
and the first shall speak only in riddles."

410
00:34:37,035 --> 00:34:39,913
No wonder you like this stuff.
It's like reading the Sun,

411
00:34:40,164 --> 00:34:41,623
Yes.

412
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:46,378
- Priests?
- Yes, but more posturing, I'm afraid.

413
00:34:47,045 --> 00:34:50,465
"They are the harbingers of death.
Nothing shall grow above or below them."

414
00:34:50,799 --> 00:34:53,802
"No seed shall flower, neither in man nor..."

415
00:34:54,553 --> 00:34:57,014
They're rebels and they'll never be any good.

416
00:34:57,055 --> 00:35:00,267
- Nothing specific about their haunts.
- Let me see that.

417
00:35:03,312 --> 00:35:05,355
"The harbingers of death."

418
00:35:05,814 --> 00:35:09,109
"Nothing shall grow above or below..."

419
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:14,114
What?

420
00:36:15,259 --> 00:36:19,221
All right. Ten more minutes of chanting
and then you guys have to go to bed.

421
00:36:28,397 --> 00:36:30,774
I'm impressed.

422
00:36:33,402 --> 00:36:37,281
- You won't get Angel.
- You think you can fight me?

423
00:36:39,032 --> 00:36:42,828
I'm not a demon, little girl.
I am something you can't even conceive.

424
00:36:44,037 --> 00:36:45,414
The First Evil.

425
00:36:45,914 --> 00:36:47,583
Beyond sin.

426
00:36:47,791 --> 00:36:49,626
Beyond death.

427
00:36:50,919 --> 00:36:53,672
I am the thing that darkness fears.

428
00:36:55,924 --> 00:36:58,302
You'll never see me, but I am everywhere.

429
00:36:59,052 --> 00:37:03,182
Every being, every thought,
every drop of hate.

430
00:37:04,057 --> 00:37:08,145
All right, I get it! You're evil.
Do we have to chat about it all day?

431
00:37:09,062 --> 00:37:11,273
Angel will be dead by sunrise.

432
00:37:12,191 --> 00:37:15,277
Your Christmas will be his wake.

433
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:20,324
- No.
- You have no idea what you're dealing with.

434
00:37:20,324 --> 00:37:21,658
Let me guess.

435
00:37:22,201 --> 00:37:23,744
Is it... evil?

436
00:37:27,831 --> 00:37:29,833
Dead by sunrise!

437
00:37:30,334 --> 00:37:32,002
Angel!

438
00:38:03,534 --> 00:38:06,495
I bet half the kids down there
are already awake,

439
00:38:06,662 --> 00:38:08,539
lying in their beds,

440
00:38:09,164 --> 00:38:11,834
sneaking downstairs,

441
00:38:12,292 --> 00:38:13,544
waiting for day.

442
00:38:13,544 --> 00:38:18,090
Angel, please. I need you to get inside.
There's only a few minutes left.

443
00:38:18,549 --> 00:38:21,552
I know. I can smell the sunrise
long before it comes.

444
00:38:22,928 --> 00:38:25,764
I don't have time to explain this.
You just have to trust me.

445
00:38:26,056 --> 00:38:29,351
- That thing that was haunting you...
- It wasn't haunting me.

446
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:32,187
- It was showing me.
- Showing you?

447
00:38:32,938 --> 00:38:34,356
- What I am.
- Were.

448
00:38:34,815 --> 00:38:36,608
And ever shall be.

449
00:38:36,692 --> 00:38:40,070
I wanted to know why I was back. Now I do.

450
00:38:41,697 --> 00:38:43,365
You don't know.

451
00:38:43,574 --> 00:38:47,661
Some great evil takes credit for bringing
you back and you buy it? You just give up?

452
00:38:47,953 --> 00:38:50,414
I can't do it again, Buffy.
I can't become a killer.

453
00:38:51,081 --> 00:38:53,959
- Then fight it.
- It's too hard.

454
00:38:54,209 --> 00:38:57,087
- You have to get inside.
- They told me to kill you.

455
00:38:57,963 --> 00:39:01,884
You were in the dream. They told me to lose
my soul in you and become a monster again.

456
00:39:02,342 --> 00:39:05,512
- I know that. What does it matter?
- Because I wanted to!

457
00:39:06,096 --> 00:39:08,599
Because I want you so badly.

458
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:14,271
I wanna take comfort in you. And I know it'll
cost me my soul and part of me doesn't care.

459
00:39:19,234 --> 00:39:22,237
I'm weak. I've never been anything else.

460
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:27,784
It's not the demon in me
that needs killing, Buffy. It's the man.

461
00:39:29,244 --> 00:39:31,330
You're weak. Everybody is.

462
00:39:31,747 --> 00:39:33,332
Everybody fails.

463
00:39:33,624 --> 00:39:37,085
Maybe this evil did bring you back,
but if it did it's because it needs you.

464
00:39:37,377 --> 00:39:39,755
And that means that you can hurt it.

465
00:39:41,757 --> 00:39:45,385
Angel, you have the power
to do real good, to make amends.

466
00:39:46,136 --> 00:39:50,182
But if you die now,
then all that you ever were was a monster.

467
00:39:53,644 --> 00:39:55,687
- Angel, the sun is coming up.
- Just go.

468
00:39:56,146 --> 00:39:59,316
- I won't.
- Do you think this is simple?

469
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,736
You can never understand
what I've done. Now, go.

470
00:40:03,028 --> 00:40:05,280
- You are not staying. I won't let you.
- Leave!

471
00:40:13,664 --> 00:40:15,833
Am I a thing worth saving, huh?

472
00:40:16,166 --> 00:40:17,960
Am I a righteous man?

473
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,130
The world wants me gone.

474
00:40:24,925 --> 00:40:26,927
What about me?

475
00:40:28,053 --> 00:40:30,055
I love you so much.

476
00:40:32,432 --> 00:40:35,102
And I tried to make you go away.

477
00:40:36,812 --> 00:40:39,022
I killed you and it didn't help.

478
00:40:41,817 --> 00:40:43,652
And I hate it.

479
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:46,530
I hate that it's so hard,

480
00:40:48,073 --> 00:40:51,243
and that you can hurt me so much.

481
00:40:54,329 --> 00:40:58,375
I know everything that you did
because you did it to me.

482
00:41:00,586 --> 00:41:02,129
God,

483
00:41:02,462 --> 00:41:04,840
I wish that I wished you dead.

484
00:41:06,216 --> 00:41:08,051
I don't.

485
00:41:09,344 --> 00:41:11,180
I can't.

486
00:41:19,354 --> 00:41:21,190
Buffy, please.

487
00:41:23,734 --> 00:41:25,736
Just this once,

488
00:41:27,488 --> 00:41:29,156
let me be strong.

489
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:31,909
Strong is fighting.

490
00:41:32,493 --> 00:41:36,580
It's hard and it's painful and it's every day.

491
00:41:37,498 --> 00:41:40,834
It's what we have to do
and we can do it together.

492
00:41:43,128 --> 00:41:46,465
But if you're too much
of a coward for that, then burn.

493
00:41:48,759 --> 00:41:53,138
If I can't convince you that you belong
in this world, then I don't know what can.

494
00:41:53,764 --> 00:41:56,642
But do not expect me to watch,

495
00:41:56,892 --> 00:41:59,770
and don't expect me
to mourn for you, because...

496
00:43:37,117 --> 00:43:39,953
While most of California
will have a balmy Christmas,

497
00:43:40,871 --> 00:43:44,917
an extreme cold front has sprung up
out of nowhere round Sunnydale,

498
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:48,504
where they are reporting
heavy snow fall for the first time ever,

499
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:53,967
Sunnydale residents won't see the sun at all
today, that cold front isn't going anywhere,

500
00:43:54,635 --> 00:43:58,805
temperatures in the high 30s means you
better bundle up if you're going outside.
