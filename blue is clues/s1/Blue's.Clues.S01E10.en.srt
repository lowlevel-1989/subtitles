YOU CAN MOVE THE SCISSORS
A DIFFERENT WAY

368
00:18:27,123 --> 00:18:28,919
EVERY TIME YOU SNIP.

369
00:18:28,953 --> 00:18:31,059
OKAY, LITTLE SNIPS.

370
00:18:33,924 --> 00:18:36,651
I THINK THEY'RE ALL
GOING TO BE DIFFERENT.

371
00:18:38,307 --> 00:18:40,068
I'M GOING
TO OPEN IT NOW.

372
00:18:46,418 --> 00:18:49,249
Girl:
SEE THE SNOWFLAKE.

373
00:18:49,283 --> 00:18:54,634
THIS ONE HAS SNIPS HERE

LITTLE PATTERNS AND...

379
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:15,621
DO YOU WANT TO GO SEE
IF IT'S STILL SNOWING?

380
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:16,760

397
00:19:54,936 --> 00:19:56,558
YEP.

398
00:19:56,593 --> 00:19:57,732

411
00:20:31,455 --> 00:20:35,217
