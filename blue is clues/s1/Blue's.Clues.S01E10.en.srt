100
00:04:26,447 --> 00:04:28,446
WE HAVE OUR FIRST CLUE.

101
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:29,622

102
00:04:29,653 --> 00:04:30,860
 HELMET.

103
00:04:30,891 --> 00:04:32,225

00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,289
OUR FIRST CLUE IS A HELMET.

117
00:05:04,322 --> 00:05:08,988
WHAT COULD BLUE PRETEND TO BE
WITH A HELMET?

118
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,448
OH.

119
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,909

LET'S GO.

122
00:05:18,829 --> 00:05:20,670
THERE'S A STAR.

123
00:05:20,703 --> 00:05:21,624
WHERE?

124
00:05:23,783 --> 00:05:25,180

134
00:05:45,371 --> 00:05:46,355
DO YOU SEE IT?

135
00:05:46,386 --> 00:05:47,276
OH.

00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,673
UH... NO.

138
00:05:52,705 --> 00:05:55,816
YOU WANT TO FIND THE CLOUD

00:06:31,499 --> 00:06:32,516
OKAY.

156
00:06:32,548 --> 00:06:34,230
SEE IF WE CAN FIND
THIS ONE.

157
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:36,801
I DON'T SEE A FISH, DO YOU?

158
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:38,834
 RIGHT THERE.

159
00:06:40,072 --> 00:06:41,850
HEY.

00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:06,740
I SEE IT NOW.

173
00:07:06,772 --> 00:07:09,152

AN ELEPHANT, TOO.

174
00:07:10,676 --> 00:07:11,566
SEE?

175
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:12,835

00:07:37,154 --> 00:07:38,520
THIS COULD BE
THE BABY.

186
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,328
OR THIS COULD
BE THE BABY.

187
00:07:40,361 --> 00:07:41,758
WHAT ARE YOU
TWO DOING?

188
00:07:41,789 --> 00:07:43,853
Both:
WE'RE PLAYING HOUSE.

189
00:07:43,884 --> 00:07:44,932
I'M THE MOTHER.

190
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:45,885
I'M THE FATHER.

191
00:07:46,901 --> 00:07:48,805
BLUE, DO YOU WANT
TO BE THE BABY?

192
00:07:49,917 --> 00:07:50,805
STEVE?

193
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:51,726
WHAT CAN I BE?

194
00:07:51,758 --> 00:07:54,107
YOU CAN BE...
THE HELPER.

195
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:57,885
THE HELPER.

196
00:07:57,918 --> 00:07:58,806
WOW.

197
00:07:58,838 --> 00:08:00,743
WILL YOU BE
A HELPER, TOO?

198
00:08:00,774 --> 00:08:02,140
YOU WILL?

199
00:08:02,171 --> 00:08:05,028
GREAT. THEN WE CAN LOOK
FOR MORE BLUE'S CLUES.

PLAY HOUSE.

201
00:08:08,298 --> 00:08:10,139
WHERE'S
OUR HOUSE?

202
00:08:10,172 --> 00:08:12,934
HOW CAN WE PLAY HOUSE
WITHOUT A HOUSE?

203
00:08:12,965 --> 00:08:14,236
OH, OH, OH.

A JOB FOR...

205
00:08:16,838 --> 00:08:20,553
THE HELPERS.

206
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:21,981

CAN BE THE MEATBALLS.
