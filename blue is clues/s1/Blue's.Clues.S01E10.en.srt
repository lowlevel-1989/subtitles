 RIGHT THERE.

362
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:36,530
 THE GREEN FROG.

363
00:18:36,564 --> 00:18:38,185
AWESOME.

364
00:18:38,219 --> 00:18:41,771
THE FROG IS
TADPOLE'S MOM.

365
00:18:46,082 --> 00:18:47,806
BUT HOW?

366
00:18:49,151 --> 00:18:50,944
WHEN I GROW UP

367
00:18:50,978 --> 00:18:53,219
I'LL BE ABLE TO HOP

368
00:18:53,254 --> 00:18:55,288
JUST LIKE MY MOM.

369
00:18:55,323 --> 00:18:58,392
FIRST I'LL GROW LEGS.

370
00:18:58,426 --> 00:19:01,185
THEN I'LL GROW ARMS.

371
00:19:01,219 --> 00:19:04,151
THEN MY TAIL WILL GET
SMALLER AND SMALLER

372
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:05,323
UNTIL IT'S GONE.

373
00:19:05,357 --> 00:19:09,633
THAT'S HOW YOU
BECOME A FROG.

374
00:19:09,668 --> 00:19:11,426
BUT THAT'S
NOT TILL LATER.

375
00:19:11,461 --> 00:19:14,978

393
00:19:54,254 --> 00:19:55,392
 NOTEBOOK.

394
00:19:55,426 --> 00:19:56,530
NOTEBOOK.

395
00:19:56,564 --> 00:19:58,564
HA-HA.

396
00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:01,116
HMM.

397
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,357
OKAY.

398
00:20:02,392 --> 00:20:05,426
A BIG CIRCLE...

399
00:20:05,461 --> 00:20:08,219
A LITTLE CIRCLE INSIDE...

400
00:20:08,254 --> 00:20:11,633
LINES DOWN HERE...

401
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:15,426
A DOT FOR THE HUB,
AND WE HAVE OUR WHEEL.

402
00:20:15,461 --> 00:20:20,357
HMM, WELL, A WHEEL
IS OUR THIRD CLUE.

403
00:20:22,219 --> 00:20:24,495
WE HAVE ALL THREE CLUES.

404
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:26,495
WE HAVE ALL THREE CLUES!

405
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:29,357
YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S TIME FOR,
OUR...

406
00:20:29,392 --> 00:20:30,702
 THINKING CHAIR.

407
00:20:30,737 --> 00:20:32,357
THINKING CHAIR. COME ON.

408
00:20:32,392 --> 00:20:35,151
AH... HEY, BLUE.

409
00:20:35,185 --> 00:20:41,737
NOW THAT WE'RE IN OUR
THINKING CHAIR, LET'S THINK.

410
00:20:41,771 --> 00:20:45,737
OKAY, SO, WE'RE TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT

411
00:20:45,771 --> 00:20:51,875
WHAT BLUE WANTS TO TRY TO DO
TODAY, AND OUR CLUES ARE:

412
00:20:51,909 --> 00:20:53,185
A HORN...

413
00:20:55,323 --> 00:20:59,461
A BASKET...

414
00:20:59,495 --> 00:21:04,151
AND A WHEEL.

415
00:21:04,185 --> 00:21:08,426
SO, WHAT COULD BLUE
WANT TO TRY TO DO

416
00:21:08,461 --> 00:21:14,082
WITH A HORN, A BASKET,
AND A WHEEL?

417
00:21:14,116 --> 00:21:15,909
OH, OH.

418
00:21:15,944 --> 00:21:19,806
COULD, COULD SHE WANT TO PUT
THE WHEEL IN THE BASKET

419
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,702
AND THEN HONK THE HORN?

420
00:21:21,737 --> 00:21:23,909
 NO.

421
00:21:23,944 --> 00:21:25,495
NO.

422
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:29,219
I DON'T THINK SO.

423
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:33,668
WHEEL, BASKET...

424
00:21:33,702 --> 00:21:35,875

WITH A HORN SHE CAN HONK

429
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:44,633
A BASKET TO PUT THINGS IN

430
00:21:44,668 --> 00:21:48,771
