 ONE DAY A GIRL WENT

201
00:08:58,156 --> 00:08:59,812
PLAY, PLAY, PLAY, PLAY.

202

 A CLUE!

220
00:09:45,812 --> 00:09:47,260
OH! A CLUE?

221
00:09:47,294 --> 00:09:50,984
IS THAT THE NAME OF BLUE'S
FAVORITE, FAVORITE STORY?

222
00:09:51,018 --> 00:09:53,812
 NO. NO.

223
00:09:53,846 --> 00:09:57,950
OH, YOU MEAN ANOTHER ONE
OF BLUE'S CLUES.

224
00:09:57,984 --> 00:09:59,156
WHERE?

225
00:09:59,191 --> 00:10:01,087
 BEHIND YOU.

226
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:07,087
CLUE NUMBER TWO.

227
00:10:10,053 --> 00:10:14,501

231
00:10:20,915 --> 00:10:21,881
 A WOLF.

232
00:10:21,915 --> 00:10:22,915
A WOLF!

233
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:25,950
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT WE NEED?

 BRICKS.

243
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,984
YEAH, RIGHT, BRICKS.

244
00:11:02,018 --> 00:11:07,777
NOW OUR SECOND CLUE IS A WOLF.

245
00:11:07,812 --> 00:11:13,915
SO WHAT STORY COULD BLUE WANT
TO READ WITH BRICKS AND A WOLF?

246
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:16,467
HMM.

247
00:11:16,501 --> 00:11:20,846
MAYBE-- MAYBE--WE SHOULD LOOK
FOR ONE MORE CLUE.

248
00:11:22,881 --> 00:11:24,087
OH, LOOK!

249
00:11:25,122 --> 00:11:26,536

"THE THREE LITTLE PIGS."

453
00:22:11,743 --> 00:22:15,915
ONCE UPON A TIME,
THERE WERE THREE LITTLE PIGS.

454
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:20,570
THE FIRST LITTLE PIG MADE
HIS HOUSE OUT OF STRAW.

455
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:24,743
BUT THE BIG BAD WOLF CAME...

456
00:22:26,018 --> 00:22:32,191
AND BLEW HIS HOUSE DOWN.

457
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:35,950
THE SECOND LITTLE PIG MADE
HIS HOUSE OUT OF...

458
00:22:35,984 --> 00:22:37,570
STICKS.

459
00:22:37,605 --> 00:22:41,984
BUT THE BIG BAD WOLF CAME...

460
00:22:42,018 --> 00:22:45,501
AND BLEW HIS HOUSE DOWN, TOO.

461
00:22:48,053 --> 00:22:53,329
BUT THE THIRD LITTLE PIG MADE
HER HOUSE OUT OF BRICKS.

462
00:22:53,363 --> 00:22:58,467
SO WHEN THE BIG BAD WOLF CAME...

463
00:23:00,156 --> 00:23:02,984

BIG BAD WOLF.

464
00:23:03,018 --> 00:23:05,053
HE HUFFED... AND HE PUFFED

465
00:23:05,087 --> 00:23:06,881

466
00:23:06,915 --> 00:23:10,260
AND HE HUFFED AND HE PUFFED
AND HE HUFFED...

467
00:23:10,294 --> 00:23:11,743
SORRY.

468
00:23:11,777 --> 00:23:14,984
BUT HE COULD NOT BLOW
