OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

169
00:06:53,018 --> 00:06:56,363
I THINK WE REALLY
NEED YOUR HELP AGAIN.

170
00:06:56,398 --> 00:06:58,846
DO JACK AND JILL
GO UP A HILL

171
00:06:58,881 --> 00:07:01,294
TO FETCH A PAIL
OF ICE CREAM?

172
00:07:01,329 --> 00:07:02,708
 NO.

173
00:07:02,743 --> 00:07:06,846
HMM, JACK AND JILL
GO UP A HILL

174
00:07:06,881 --> 00:07:09,743
TO FETCH A PAIL OF...

175
00:07:09,777 --> 00:07:10,950

176
00:07:10,984 --> 00:07:12,363


177
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:13,708


178
00:07:13,743 --> 00:07:15,225


179
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,294
YES!

180
00:07:16,329 --> 00:07:17,984
YEAH, THAT'S IT.

181
00:07:18,018 --> 00:07:19,743
OKAY,
LET'S DO IT.

182
00:07:19,777 --> 00:07:21,432
OKAY, YOU READY?

183
00:07:21,467 --> 00:07:22,743


184
00:07:22,777 --> 00:07:23,743
JACK...

185
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,018
THAT'S ME.

186
00:07:25,053 --> 00:07:28,225
AND JILL
GO UP A HILL

187
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:32,087
TO FETCH A PAIL
OF WATER.

188
00:07:32,122 --> 00:07:33,294
JACK FELL DOWN...

189
00:07:33,329 --> 00:07:34,467
I LOVE

HIS CROWN...

191
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,122

 TUMBLING AFTER.

196
00:07:44,915 --> 00:07:46,984
JILL COMES
TUMBLING AFTER.

197
00:07:47,018 --> 00:07:48,122

00:08:52,018 --> 00:08:55,225
WE MAKE UP STORIES
WITH OUR PUPPETS.

224
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,122
 ONE DAY A GIRL WENT  
OUTSIDE TO PLAY.

225
00:08:58,156 --> 00:08:59,812
PLAY, PLAY, PLAY, PLAY.

226
00:08:59,846 --> 00:09:03,260
 SHE SAW A MONSTER.

227
00:09:03,294 --> 00:09:05,122
 BUT SHE SAID...

228
00:09:05,156 --> 00:09:07,018
HELLO.

229
00:09:07,053 --> 00:09:09,225
:
HELLO.

230
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,915
ARE YOU
A SCARY MONSTER?

231
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:14,777
NO!

232
00:09:14,812 --> 00:09:16,984
I'M A SILLY MONSTER.

233
00:09:17,018 --> 00:09:19,605
OOGLA-BOOGLA,
OOGLA-BOOGLA.

234
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:23,777
 THE TWO OF THEM OOGLA-BOOGLAED  
ALL THE WAY HOME.

235
00:09:23,812 --> 00:09:27,018
THE END.

236
00:09:27,053 --> 00:09:28,122
BYE.

237
00:09:28,156 --> 00:09:30,674
WOW, THAT WAS GREAT.

238
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:32,122
OOGLA-BOOGLA.

239
00:09:32,156 --> 00:09:36,225
ALL STORIES ARE GREAT,
DON'T YOU THINK?

240
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,915
OH, HEY!

241
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:40,018
HEY, BLUE.

242
00:09:40,053 --> 00:09:43,605
IT'S ALMOST STORY TIME.

243
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:45,777
 A CLUE!

244
00:09:45,812 --> 00:09:47,260
OH! A CLUE?

245
00:09:47,294 --> 00:09:50,984
IS THAT THE NAME OF BLUE'S
FAVORITE, FAVORITE STORY?

246
00:09:51,018 --> 00:09:53,812
 NO. NO.

247
00:09:53,846 --> 00:09:57,950
OH, YOU MEAN ANOTHER ONE
OF BLUE'S CLUES.

248
00:09:57,984 --> 00:09:59,156
WHERE?

249
00:09:59,191 --> 00:10:01,087
 BEHIND YOU.

250
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:07,087
CLUE NUMBER TWO.

251
00:10:10,053 --> 00:10:14,501
WHAT BIG TEETH IT HAS.

252
00:10:14,536 --> 00:10:16,018
AND LOOK AT THAT TAIL.

253
00:10:16,053 --> 00:10:17,329
HA!

254
00:10:17,363 --> 00:10:20,881
SO, BLUE'S SECOND CLUE
MUST BE A... A...

255
00:10:20,915 --> 00:10:21,881
 A WOLF.

256
00:10:21,915 --> 00:10:22,915
A WOLF!

257
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:25,950
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT WE NEED?

258
00:10:25,984 --> 00:10:30,191
OUR HANDY-DANDY,
SUPER-DUPER NOTEBOOK.

259
00:10:32,329 --> 00:10:35,122
SO...

260
00:10:35,156 --> 00:10:37,570
A WOLF'S HEAD...

261
00:10:42,846 --> 00:10:45,191
THOSE BIG TEETH...

262
00:10:47,501 --> 00:10:50,329
AND, OF COURSE, THE TAIL...

263
00:10:50,363 --> 00:10:53,225
AND WE HAVE A WOLF.

264
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,950
HMM, SO...

265
00:10:55,984 --> 00:10:57,812
WHAT WAS OUR FIRST CLUE?

266
00:10:57,846 --> 00:10:58,915
 BRICKS.

267
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,984
YEAH, RIGHT, BRICKS.

268
00:11:02,018 --> 00:11:07,777
NOW OUR SECOND CLUE IS A WOLF.

269
00:11:07,812 --> 00:11:13,915
SO WHAT STORY COULD BLUE WANT
TO READ WITH BRICKS AND A WOLF?

270
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:16,467
HMM.

271
00:11:16,501 --> 00:11:20,846
MAYBE-- MAYBE--WE SHOULD LOOK
FOR ONE MORE CLUE.

272
00:11:22,881 --> 00:11:24,087
OH, LOOK!

273
00:11:24,122 --> 00:11:25,087


274
00:11:25,122 --> 00:11:26,536
IT'S OUR PHOTO ALBUM.

275
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:28,915
IT'S WHERE WE KEEP
ALL OUR PICTURES.

276
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,294
WANT TO LOOK AT THEM?

277
00:11:30,329 --> 00:11:31,570


278
00:11:31,605 --> 00:11:33,122
OKAY.

279
00:11:33,156 --> 00:11:36,570
THEN WE CAN LOOK
FOR MORE BLUE'S CLUES.

280
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:41,846


281
00:11:41,881 --> 00:11:43,087
OH, LOOK!

282
00:11:43,122 --> 00:11:47,053
IT'S MR. SALT
AND MRS. PEPPER

283
00:11:47,087 --> 00:11:50,812
AND TICKETY TOCK.

284
00:11:50,846 --> 00:11:52,156


285
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:54,536
OH! AND LOOK, BLUE.

286
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:58,605
THESE ARE PICTURES
OF YOUR FIRST DAY
OF SCHOOL.

287
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,501
OH!

288
00:12:00,536 --> 00:12:03,363
WELL, THESE PICTURES
ARE ALL OUT OF ORDER.

289
00:12:03,398 --> 00:12:05,225


290
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:08,915
CAN YOU HELP ME PUT
THEM BACK TOGETHER?

291
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:10,122


292
00:12:10,156 --> 00:12:12,639
OH, GOOD.

293
00:12:12,674 --> 00:12:16,053
NOW, CAN YOU TELL
FROM THESE PICTURES

294
00:12:16,087 --> 00:12:18,881
WHAT HAPPENED
IN SCHOOL FIRST?

295
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,294
HMM.

296
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,915
 RIGHT THERE!

297
00:12:27,156 --> 00:12:31,053
 YEAH, THAT'S IT.

298
00:12:31,087 --> 00:12:32,984
BRILLIANT, BLUE.

299
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:35,225
YOU SAID "HI" TO A NEW FRIEND.

300
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:38,570
HER NAME IS...

301
00:12:38,605 --> 00:12:40,950
MAGENTA, RIGHT?

302
00:12:40,984 --> 00:12:42,260
RIGHT.

303
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:43,846
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

304
00:12:46,674 --> 00:12:48,605
 RIGHT THERE!

305
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,467
 YEAH! THAT'S IT.

306
00:12:53,501 --> 00:12:55,225
THAT'S GREAT.

307
00:12:55,260 --> 00:13:01,501
YOU AND MAGENTA WENT
TO THE PAINT TABLE TO PAINT.

308
00:13:01,536 --> 00:13:02,881
THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

309
00:13:05,087 --> 00:13:06,915
 RIGHT THERE.

310
00:13:09,501 --> 00:13:10,708
 THAT'S IT!

311
00:13:10,743 --> 00:13:11,984
THAT'S RIGHT!

312
00:13:12,018 --> 00:13:17,432
YOU AND MAGENTA STARTED
REALLY PAINTING.

313
00:13:17,467 --> 00:13:18,915
THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

314
00:13:20,329 --> 00:13:23,467
 THAT'S THE ONE.

315
00:13:23,501 --> 00:13:24,605
 YEAH!

316
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,053
THAT'S GREAT!

317
00:13:26,087 --> 00:13:29,570
YOU AND MAGENTA GAVE EACH OTHER
THE PICTURES YOU MADE.

318
00:13:29,605 --> 00:13:31,536


319
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:38,984
WOW! WHAT A GREAT STORY ABOUT
BLUE'S FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL.

320
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:40,708


321
00:13:40,743 --> 00:13:42,225
HEY, DID YOU HEAR THAT?

322
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,225
THAT SOUNDS LIKE TICKETY-TOCK.

323
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,984
COME ON!

324
00:13:46,018 --> 00:13:47,570

WE HEAR YOU!

326
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:52,260
SHE'S AN ALARM CLOCK.

327
00:13:52,294 --> 00:13:54,156


328
00:13:57,018 --> 00:13:59,156
HI, STEVE.

329
00:13:59,191 --> 00:14:00,156
HEY, TICKETY.

331
00:14:01,915 --> 00:14:03,915


332
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:07,846
YES, I WANTED TO TELL YOU:
IT'S ALMOST STORY TIME.

333
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:09,950
WELL, THANK YOU,
TICKETY.

334
00:14:09,984 --> 00:14:13,708
OOH! OOH! BUT, YOU KNOW,
WE STILL HAVE TO FIGURE OUT

335
00:14:13,743 --> 00:14:16,639

336
00:14:16,674 --> 00:14:18,639

506
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:35,950
THE SECOND LITTLE PIG MADE
HIS HOUSE OUT OF...

507
00:22:35,984 --> 00:22:37,570
STICKS.

508
00:22:37,605 --> 00:22:41,984
BUT THE BIG BAD WOLF CAME...

509
00:22:42,018 --> 00:22:45,501
AND BLEW HIS HOUSE DOWN, TOO.

510
00:22:48,053 --> 00:22:53,329
BUT THE THIRD LITTLE PIG MADE
HER HOUSE OUT OF BRICKS.

511
00:22:53,363 --> 00:22:58,467
SO WHEN THE BIG BAD WOLF CAME...

512
00:23:00,156 --> 00:23:02,984
:
BIG BAD WOLF.

513
00:23:03,018 --> 00:23:05,053
HE HUFFED... AND HE PUFFED

514
00:23:05,087 --> 00:23:06,881
AND HE HUFFED AND HE PUFFED

515
00:23:06,915 --> 00:23:10,260
AND HE HUFFED AND HE PUFFED
AND HE HUFFED...

516
00:23:10,294 --> 00:23:11,743
SORRY.

517
00:23:11,777 --> 00:23:14,984
BUT HE COULD NOT BLOW
THE LITTLE PIG'S HOUSE DOWN.

518
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:16,398
THE END.

519
00:23:16,432 --> 00:23:17,812
All:
READ IT AGAIN.

520
00:23:17,846 --> 00:23:19,674
