00:09:09,206 --> 00:09:11.068
HELLO.

229
00:09:11,103 --> 00:09:13.275

NO!

232
00:09:18,862 --> 00:09:21.034
I'M A SILLY MONSTER.

233
00:09:21,068 --> 00:09:23.655
OOGLA-BOOGLA,
OOGLA-BOOGLA.

DON'T YOU THINK?

240
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:41.965
OH, HEY!

241
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44.068

242
00:09:44,103 --> 00:09:47.655
IT'S ALMOST STORY TIME.

243
00:09:47,689 --> 00:09:49.827
 A CLUE! 

244
00:09:49,862 --> 00:09:51.310
OH! A CLUE?

245
00:09:51,344 --> 00:09:55.034
IS THAT THE NAME OF BLUE'S
FAVORITE, FAVORITE STORY?

246
00:09:55,068 --> 00:09:57.862
 NO. NO. 

247
00:09:57,896 --> 00:10:02.000
OH, YOU MEAN ANOTHER ONE
OF BLUE'S CLUES.

248
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:03.206
WHERE?

249
00:10:03,241 --> 00:10:05.137
 BEHIND YOU. 

250
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11.137
CLUE NUMBER TWO.

251
00:10:14,103 --> 00:10:18.551
WHAT BIG TEETH IT HAS.

252
00:10:18,586 --> 00:10:20.068
AND LOOK AT THAT TAIL.

253
00:10:20,103 --> 00:10:21.379
HA!

254
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:24.931
SO, BLUE'S SECOND CLUE
MUST BE A... A...

255
00:10:24,965 --> 00:10:25.931
 A WOLF. 

256
00:10:25,965 --> 00:10:26.965
A WOLF!

257
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30.000
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT WE NEED?

258

00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:54.379
AND, OF COURSE, THE TAIL...

263
00:10:54,413 --> 00:10:57.275
AND WE HAVE A WOLF.

264
00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:00.000
HMM, SO...

265
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01.862
WHAT WAS OUR FIRST CLUE?

266
00:11:01,896 --> 00:11:02.965
 BRICKS. 

267
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06.034
YEAH, RIGHT, BRICKS.

268
00:11:06,068 --> 00:11:11.827
NOW OUR SECOND CLUE IS A WOLF.

269
00:11:11,862 --> 00:11:17.965
SO WHAT STORY COULD BLUE WANT
TO READ WITH BRICKS AND A WOLF?

270
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20.517
HMM.

271
00:11:20,551 --> 00:11:24.896
MAYBE-- MAYBE--WE SHOULD LOOK
FOR ONE MORE CLUE.

272
00:11:26,931 --> 00:11:28.137
OH, LOOK!

273
00:11:28,172 --> 00:11:29.137


274
00:11:29,172 --> 00:11:30.586
IT'S OUR PHOTO ALBUM.

275
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32.965
IT'S WHERE WE KEEP
ALL OUR PICTURES.

276
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34.344
WANT TO LOOK AT THEM?

277
00:11:34,379 --> 00:11:35.620


278
00:11:35,655 --> 00:11:37.172
OKAY.

279
00:11:37,206 --> 00:11:40.620
THEN WE CAN LOOK
FOR MORE BLUE'S CLUES.

280
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:45.896


281
00:11:45,931 --> 00:11:47.137
OH, LOOK!

499
00:22:08,482 --> 00:22:10.931
"THE THREE LITTLE PIGS."

500
00:22:12,793 --> 00:22:14.241


501
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:19.965
ONCE UPON A TIME,
THERE WERE THREE LITTLE PIGS.

502
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24.620
THE FIRST LITTLE PIG MADE
HIS HOUSE OUT OF STRAW.

503
00:22:24,655 --> 00:22:28.793
BUT THE BIG BAD WOLF CAME...

504
00:22:28,827 --> 00:22:30.034


505
00:22:30,068 --> 00:22:36.241
AND BLEW HIS HOUSE DOWN.

506
00:22:36,275 --> 00:22:40.000
THE SECOND LITTLE PIG MADE
HIS HOUSE OUT OF...

507
00:22:40,034 --> 00:22:41.620
STICKS.

508
00:22:41,655 --> 00:22:46.034
BUT THE BIG BAD WOLF CAME...

509
00:22:46,068 --> 00:22:49.551
AND BLEW HIS HOUSE DOWN, TOO.

510
00:22:52,103 --> 00:22:57.379
BUT THE THIRD LITTLE PIG MADE
HER HOUSE OUT OF BRICKS.

511
00:22:57,413 --> 00:23:02.517
SO WHEN THE BIG BAD WOLF CAME...

512
00:23:04,206 --> 00:23:07.034
:
BIG BAD WOLF.

513
00:23:07,068 --> 00:23:09.103
HE HUFFED... AND HE PUFFED

514
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:10.931
AND HE HUFFED AND HE PUFFED

515
00:23:10,965 --> 00:23:14.310
AND HE HUFFED AND HE PUFFED
AND HE HUFFED...

516
00:23:14,344 --> 00:23:15.793
SORRY.

517
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:19.034
BUT HE COULD NOT BLOW
THE LITTLE PIG'S HOUSE DOWN.

518
00:23:19,068 --> 00:23:20.448
THE END.

519
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:21.862
