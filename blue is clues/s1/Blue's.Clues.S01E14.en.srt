00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:56,933
YEAH!

181
00:08:56,967 --> 00:08:58,733
LET'S DO
THE WHOLE SONG.

182
00:08:58,767 --> 00:09:00,633
READY?

183
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:05,300
THE, UH,
THE WHOLE SONG, HUH?

184
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:08,400
YOU'LL SING IT
WITH ME, RIGHT?

185
00:09:08,433 --> 00:09:09,567
GOOD.

186
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,800
YOU READY?

187
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:14,567
HERE GOES.

188
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,767
* ONE LITTLE MONKEY
JUMPING ON THE BED *

189
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,967
* ONE FELL OFF AND
BUMPED HER HEAD *

190
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,100
* MAMA CALLED
THE DOCTOR AND
THE DOCTOR SAID *

191
00:09:24,133 --> 00:09:27,200
* "NO MORE MONKEYS
JUMPING ON THE BED." *

192
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,267
THAT WAS GREAT!

193
00:09:32,467 --> 00:09:35,100
OH, WE BETTER GO.

194
00:09:35,133 --> 00:09:37,600
WE STILL HAVE TO FIND
TWO MORE MONKEYS.

195
00:09:38,633 --> 00:09:41,267
I MEAN CLUES.

196
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,833
* MAIL TIME, MAIL TIME,
MAIL TIME... *

197
00:09:43,867 --> 00:09:45,900
HEY, YOU KNOW

00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:52,433
* HERE'S THE MAIL,
IT NEVER FAILS *

201
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:54,433
* IT MAKES ME WANT
TO WAG MY TAIL *

202
00:09:54,467 --> 00:09:59,067
* WHEN IT COMES,
I WANT TO WAIL, "MAIL!" *

203
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,933
* IF YOU'RE HAPPY
AND YOU KNOW IT,
WAVE YOUR FLAG. *

204
00:10:06,967 --> 00:10:09,067
Together:
* IF YOU'RE HAPPY
AND YOU KNOW IT *

205
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,700

TO SHOW IT *

206
00:10:10,733 --> 00:10:14,267

YOU KNOW IT, WAVE YOUR FLAG. *

207
00:10:17,967 --> 00:10:19,100
THANK YOU.

208
00:10:19,133 --> 00:10:20,267
YOU'RE WELCOME.

209
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,733
WE JUST GOT A LETTER.

210
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,967

HI, STEVE.

239
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,433
DID I HEAR YOU
SINGING THIS SONG?

240
00:11:33,467 --> 00:11:36,667
OH, YEAH, THAT'S
"IF YOU'RE HAPPY
AND YOU KNOW IT."

241
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,600
MAILBOX WAS JUST
SINGING THAT.

242
00:11:38,633 --> 00:11:41,133
STEVE, THAT'S
MY FAVORITE
SONG GAME.

243
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:42,867
WANT TO PLAY IT
WITH ME?

244
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:47,667
DO YOU WANT TO PLAY
"IF YOU'RE HAPPY
AND YOU KNOW IT"
WITH TICKETY?

245
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,667
OKAY. THEN WE'LL GO LOOK
FOR MORE BLUE'S CLUES.

246
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,000
I'M SO EXCITED!

247
00:11:53,033 --> 00:11:57,233
OKAY, I'LL ACT IT OUT,
AND YOU ALL TELL ME
WHAT I'M DOING.

248
00:11:57,267 --> 00:12:00,567
OH, SO TICKETY WILL
ACT OUT THE MOVEMENTS

249
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,667
AND WE'LL GUESS
WHAT SHE'S DOING.

250
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,167
GREAT. YOU READY?

251
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,900
LET'S GO.

252
00:12:06,933 --> 00:12:09,367
* IF YOU'RE HAPPY
AND YOU KNOW IT... *

253
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,733
WHAT'S THIS?

254
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,767
HMM.

255
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,667
* IF YOU'RE HAPPY
AND YOU KNOW IT... *

256
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,600
* WIGGLE YOUR EARS.

257
00:12:19,633 --> 00:12:20,767
* IF...

258
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,433
 NO!

259
00:12:22,467 --> 00:12:24,433
NO?

260
00:12:24,467 --> 00:12:27,267
WELL, WHAT IS SHE DOING?

261
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,267
 STAMP YOUR FEET!

262
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,200
OH, RIGHT,
STAMP YOUR FEET.

263
00:12:32,233 --> 00:12:33,933
THAT'S PERFECT.

264
00:12:33,967 --> 00:12:35,767
RIGHT,
STAMP YOUR FEET.

265
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,033
LET'S SING
ANOTHER ONE.

266
00:12:39,067 --> 00:12:41,767
* IF YOU'RE HAPPY
AND YOU KNOW IT... *

267
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,967
WHAT'S THIS?

268
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,433
WHAT IS SHE DOING?

269
00:12:46,467 --> 00:12:48,933
 WAVING HER ARMS.

270
00:12:48,967 --> 00:12:50,267
OH...

271
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,133
RIGHT, WAVE YOUR ARMS.

272
00:12:52,167 --> 00:12:54,700
OF COURSE.

273
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:58,467
Both:
* IF YOU'RE HAPPY AND
YOU KNOW IT, WAVE YOUR ARMS *

274
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,000
* IF YOU'RE HAPPY AND YOU
KNOW IT, WAVE THOSE ARMS *

275
00:13:02,033 --> 00:13:03,900
* IF YOU'RE HAPPY
AND YOU KNOW IT *

276
00:13:03,933 --> 00:13:05,700
* AND YOU REALLY WANT
TO SHOW IT *

277
00:13:05,733 --> 00:13:08,733
* IF YOU'RE HAPPY AND
YOU KNOW IT, WAVE YOUR ARMS *

278
00:13:08,767 --> 00:13:10,200
* OR STAMP YOUR FEET

279
00:13:10,233 --> 00:13:11,600
* OR WIGGLE YOUR EARS

280
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,100
* OR WAG YOUR TAIL

281
00:13:14,133 --> 00:13:15,200
* OR CLAP YOUR HANDS.

282
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,167
WHAT'S THAT?

283
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,867
OH, IT'S RAIN.

284
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,633
 A CLUE!

285
00:13:31,667 --> 00:13:34,400
NO, IT'S DEFINITELY RAIN.

286
00:13:34,433 --> 00:13:36,400
 NO, IT'S A CLUE!

287
00:13:36,433 --> 00:13:38,067
A CLUE? REALLY?

288
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:42,200
WHERE?

289
00:13:42,233 --> 00:13:49,900
BUT... ALL I SEE IS RAIN. UM...

290
00:13:49,933 --> 00:13:53,933
OH, THE RAIN IS A CLUE!

291
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,133
OKAY, I'M WITH YOU NOW,
ALL RIGHT.

292
00:13:58,167 --> 00:13:59,767
YOU KNOW WHAT WE NEED-- OUR...

293
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,033
NOTEBOOK.
 NOTEBOOK!

294
00:14:08,167 --> 00:14:11,067
OKAY, WE HAVE SOME RAIN DROPS.

295
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,267
KIND OF LIKE AN OVAL.

296
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,800
THEN SOME MORE RAIN DROPS...

297
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:20,667
AND A BIG, CURVY RAIN CLOUD.

298
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,833
THERE.

299
00:14:21,867 --> 00:14:23,567
RAIN.

300
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,300
OKAY, SO, UH,
WHAT WAS OUR FIRST CLUE?

301
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:27,433
 A SUN!

302
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:29,267
RIGHT, SUN.

303
00:14:30,667 --> 00:14:31,767
MMM...

304
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,067
AND NOW WE HAVE RAIN.

305
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,633
HMM.

306
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:41,267
SO WHAT SONG GAME...

307
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:46,033
COULD BLUE WANT TO PLAY
WITH SUN AND RAIN?

308
00:14:47,567 --> 00:14:49,067
OOH.

309
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,800
YEAH, I THINK WE NEED TO FIND
OUR LAST BLUE'S CLUE.

310
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,433
OH... DID YOU SEE THAT?

311
00:15:03,467 --> 00:15:08,467
BLUE JUST JUMPED RIGHT INTO
THE PICTURE OF THAT... BEACH.

312
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,000
LET'S GO, TOO.

313
00:15:11,033 --> 00:15:14,367
* BLUE SKIDDOO, WE CAN, TOO.

314
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,733
WOW.

315
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:22,800
THE BEACH.

316
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,067
OOH, RAIN CLOUD.

317
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,567
STEVE. STEVE!

318
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,067
CRABS.

319
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:47,267
STEVE, WE MADE UP A DANCE
TO THE SOUND OF RAIN.

320
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:50,433
RAIN DANCE? COOL.

321
00:15:50,467 --> 00:15:53,200
CAN YOU FIGURE OUT
WHICH ONE OF US

322
00:15:53,233 --> 00:15:56,233
IS DANCING
TO THE RHYTHM
OF THE RAIN?

323
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,467
WHICH ONE OF THESE CRABS
IS DANCING TO THE RHYTHM
OF THE RAIN?

324
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,133
 THAT ONE.

325
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,200
OH, THIS CRAB.

326
00:16:09,233 --> 00:16:12,167
YEAH, SEE HOW HIS MOVEMENTS
ARE QUICK

327
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,467
LIKE THE RHYTHM
OF THE RAIN?

328
00:16:23,033 --> 00:16:24,767
GOOD JOB.

329
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,767
OOH... WIND.

330
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,000
OCTOPI.

331
00:16:34,033 --> 00:16:36,167
STEVE, STEVE!

332
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,800
CAN YOU FIGURE OUT
WHICH ONE OF US

333
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:41,733
IS DANCING TO THE RHYTHM
OF THE WIND?

334
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:43,467
CAN YOU TELL
WHICH OCTOPUS

335
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,933
IS MOVING TO THE RHYTHM
OF THE WIND?

336
00:16:50,167 --> 00:16:51,733
 THAT ONE.

337
00:16:51,767 --> 00:16:54,333
OH, THIS ONE.

338
00:16:54,367 --> 00:16:55,667
RIGHT.

339
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,300
SEE HOW SHE'S
MOVING SLOWLY
AND GRACEFULLY

340
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:00,333
LIKE THE RHYTHM
OF THE WIND?

341
00:17:12,267 --> 00:17:15,400
HEY... GOOD JOB.

342
00:17:16,933 --> 00:17:18,633
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

343
00:17:18,667 --> 00:17:22,533
OH, WAVES.

344
00:17:22,567 --> 00:17:24,800
AND HERONS.

345
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:26,000
STEVE, STEVE!

346
00:17:26,033 --> 00:17:29,133
CAN YOU FIGURE OUT
WHICH ONE OF US

347
00:17:29,167 --> 00:17:31,933
IS DANCING
TO THE RHYTHM
OF THE WAVES?

348
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,267
OH... HEY, SORRY.

349
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,967
BETTER GIVE THEM
SOME ROOM. SORRY.

350
00:17:39,967 --> 00:17:42,633
 THAT ONE!

351
00:17:42,667 --> 00:17:44,633
OH, RIGHT.

352
00:17:44,667 --> 00:17:47,367
THIS HERON IS MOVING
ON ALL THREE BEATS.

353
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,333
SHE'S IN PERFECT
RHYTHM, SEE?

354
00:17:49,367 --> 00:17:50,767
EXCUSE ME.

355
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,300
THANK YOU.

356
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:05,267
THAT WAS SO MUCH FUN.

357
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:08,767
HEY, WILL YOU DANCE WITH ME?

358
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,433
OH, GOOD.

359
00:18:10,467 --> 00:18:14,533
FIRST LET'S DANCE TO THE RHYTHM
OF THE RAIN.

360
