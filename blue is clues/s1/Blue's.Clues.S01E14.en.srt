00:08:30,067 --> 00:08:32.300
NO?

182
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:36.400
WELL, WHAT DID I
MESS UP NOW?

183
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:39.033
 NO MORE MONKEYS! 

184
00:08:39,067 --> 00:08:41.033
( laughing... ):
OH, YEAH, RIGHT.

185
00:08:41,067 --> 00:08:42.367
NO MORE MONKEYS.

186
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45.367
PROBABLY DON'T WANT TO
BE JUMPING ON THE BED.

187
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48.567
OKAY.
ONE MORE TIME.

188
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52.133
OKAY, LET'S TRY THIS
ONE MORE TIME.

189
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:55.467
* MAMA CALLED
THE DOCTOR AND
THE DOCTOR SAID *

190
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58.333
* "NO MORE MONKEYS
JUMPING ON THE BED." *

191
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00.133
YEAH!

192
00:09:00,167 --> 00:09:01.933
LET'S DO
THE WHOLE SONG.

193
00:09:01,967 --> 00:09:03.833
READY?

194
00:09:03,867 --> 00:09:08.500
THE, UH,
THE WHOLE SONG, HUH?

195
00:09:08,533 --> 00:09:11.600
YOU'LL SING IT
WITH ME, RIGHT?

196
00:09:11,633 --> 00:09:12.767
GOOD.

197
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14.000
YOU READY?

198
00:09:14,033 --> 00:09:17.767
HERE GOES.

199
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20.967
* ONE LITTLE MONKEY
JUMPING ON THE BED *

200
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24.167
* ONE FELL OFF AND
BUMPED HER HEAD *

201
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27.300
* MAMA CALLED
THE DOCTOR AND
THE DOCTOR SAID *

202
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30.400
* "NO MORE MONKEYS
JUMPING ON THE BED." *

203
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33.467
THAT WAS GREAT!

204
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35.633
( barking )

205
00:09:35,667 --> 00:09:38.300
OH, WE BETTER GO.

206
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40.800
WE STILL HAVE TO FIND
TWO MORE MONKEYS.

207
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:44.467
I MEAN CLUES.

208
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47.033
* MAIL TIME, MAIL TIME,
MAIL TIME... *

209
00:09:47,067 --> 00:09:49.100

213
00:09:55,667 --> 00:09:57.633
* IT MAKES ME WANT
TO WAG MY TAIL *

214
00:09:57,667 --> 00:10:02.267
* WHEN IT COMES,
I WANT TO WAIL, "MAIL!" *

215
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03.300
( barks )

216
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:10.133
* IF YOU'RE HAPPY
AND YOU KNOW IT,
WAVE YOUR FLAG. *

217
00:10:10,167 --> 00:10:12.267
Together:
* IF YOU'RE HAPPY

218
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13.900

SINGING THIS SONG?

257
00:11:33,667 --> 00:11:36.633
( humming 
 "If You're Happy 
 And You Know It" )

258
00:11:36,667 --> 00:11:39.867
OH, YEAH, THAT'S
"IF YOU'RE HAPPY

259
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41.800
MAILBOX WAS JUST

260
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:44.333
STEVE, THAT'S
MY FAVORITE
SONG GAME.

261
00:11:44,367 --> 00:11:46.067
WANT TO PLAY IT

262
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:50.867
DO YOU WANT TO PLAY

263
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53.867
OKAY. THEN WE'LL GO LOOK

00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08.367
GREAT. YOU READY?

269
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10.100

NO?

278
00:12:27,667 --> 00:12:30.467
WELL, WHAT IS SHE DOING?

279
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32.467
 STAMP YOUR FEET! 

280
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35.400
OH, RIGHT,
STAMP YOUR FEET.

281
00:12:35,433 --> 00:12:37.133
THAT'S PERFECT.

282
00:12:37,167 --> 00:12:38.967
RIGHT,
STAMP YOUR FEET.

283
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42.233
LET'S SING

285
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46.167

287
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:52.133
 WAVING HER ARMS. 

288
00:12:52,167 --> 00:12:53.467
OH...

289
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55.333

Both:
* IF YOU'RE HAPPY AND
YOU KNOW IT, WAVE YOUR ARMS *

292
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:05.200
* IF YOU'RE HAPPY AND YOU

293
00:13:05,233 --> 00:13:07.100

AND YOU KNOW IT *

294
00:13:07,133 --> 00:13:08.900
* AND YOU REALLY WANT
TO SHOW IT *

295
00:13:08,933 --> 00:13:11.933
* IF YOU'RE HAPPY AND
YOU KNOW IT, WAVE YOUR ARMS *

296
00:13:11,967 --> 00:13:13.400

297
00:13:13,433 --> 00:13:14.800
* OR WIGGLE YOUR EARS

298
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:15.967
( barks )

299
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17.300
* OR WAG YOUR TAIL

300
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:18.400
* OR CLAP YOUR HANDS.

301
00:13:18,433 --> 00:13:20.400
( both clapping )

302
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:23.933
( thunderclap )

303
00:13:23,967 --> 00:13:25.367
WHAT'S THAT?

304
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28.167
( rain falling )

305
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:32.067
OH, IT'S RAIN.

306
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34.833
 A CLUE! 

307
00:13:34,867 --> 00:13:37.600
NO, IT'S DEFINITELY RAIN.

308
00:13:37,633 --> 00:13:39.600
 NO, IT'S A CLUE! 

309
00:13:39,633 --> 00:13:41.267
A CLUE? REALLY?

310
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:45.400
WHERE?

311
00:13:45,433 --> 00:13:53.100
BUT... ALL I SEE IS RAIN. UM...

312
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:57.133
OH, THE RAIN IS A CLUE!

313
00:13:57,167 --> 00:13:58.367
( laughs )

314
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01.333
OKAY, I'M WITH YOU NOW,
ALL RIGHT.

315
00:14:01,367 --> 00:14:02.967
YOU KNOW WHAT WE NEED-- OUR...

316
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06.233
NOTEBOOK.
 NOTEBOOK! 

317
00:14:06,267 --> 00:14:11.333
( humming )

318
00:14:11,367 --> 00:14:14.267
OKAY, WE HAVE SOME RAIN DROPS.

319
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17.467
KIND OF LIKE AN OVAL.

320
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20.000
THEN SOME MORE RAIN DROPS...

321
00:14:20,033 --> 00:14:23.867
AND A BIG, CURVY RAIN CLOUD.

322
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25.033
THERE.

323
00:14:25,067 --> 00:14:26.767
RAIN.

324
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29.500
OKAY, SO, UH,
WHAT WAS OUR FIRST CLUE?

325
00:14:29,533 --> 00:14:30.633
 A SUN! 

326
00:14:30,667 --> 00:14:32.467
RIGHT, SUN.

327
00:14:33,867 --> 00:14:34.967
MMM...

328
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38.267
AND NOW WE HAVE RAIN.

329
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39.833
HMM.

330
00:14:39,867 --> 00:14:44.467
SO WHAT SONG GAME...
( cymbals playing )

331
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:49.233
COULD BLUE WANT TO PLAY
WITH SUN AND RAIN?

332
00:14:49,267 --> 00:14:50.733
( thunderclap )

333
00:14:50,767 --> 00:14:52.267
OOH.

334
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56.000
YEAH, I THINK WE NEED TO FIND
OUR LAST BLUE'S CLUE.

335
00:14:56,033 --> 00:14:57.367
( Blue barks )

336
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:04.667
( barking "Blue Skiddoo" )

337
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06.633
OH... DID YOU SEE THAT?

338
00:15:06,667 --> 00:15:11.667
BLUE JUST JUMPED RIGHT INTO
THE PICTURE OF THAT... BEACH.

339
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14.200
LET'S GO, TOO.

340
00:15:14,233 --> 00:15:17.567
* BLUE SKIDDOO, WE CAN, TOO.

341
00:15:21,033 --> 00:15:22.933
WOW.

342
00:15:22,967 --> 00:15:24.500
( barks "wow" )

343
00:15:24,533 --> 00:15:26.000
THE BEACH.

344
00:15:26,033 --> 00:15:28.033
( barks 
 "the beach" )

345
00:15:29,533 --> 00:15:32.600
( surf music playing... )

346
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35.967
( thunderclap )

347
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38.267
OOH, RAIN CLOUD.

348
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41.767
STEVE. STEVE!

349
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46.267
CRABS.

350
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:50.467
STEVE, WE MADE UP A DANCE
TO THE SOUND OF RAIN.

351
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53.633
RAIN DANCE? COOL.

352
00:15:53,667 --> 00:15:56.400
CAN YOU FIGURE OUT
WHICH ONE OF US

353
00:15:56,433 --> 00:15:59.433
IS DANCING
TO THE RHYTHM
OF THE RAIN?

354
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05.667
WHICH ONE OF THESE CRABS
IS DANCING TO THE RHYTHM
OF THE RAIN?

355
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10.333
 THAT ONE. 

356
00:16:10,367 --> 00:16:12.400
OH, THIS CRAB.

357
00:16:12,433 --> 00:16:15.367
YEAH, SEE HOW HIS MOVEMENTS
ARE QUICK

358
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17.667
LIKE THE RHYTHM
OF THE RAIN?

359
00:16:26,233 --> 00:16:27.967
( chuckles )
GOOD JOB.

360
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29.567
