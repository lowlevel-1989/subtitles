I'M LOOKING
FOR MY FRIEND.

385
00:16:20,724 --> 00:16:24.137
OH, ANOTHER ANIMAL ON SAFARI
NEEDS OUR HELP.

386
00:16:24,172 --> 00:16:29.068
SO, WHAT DOES YOUR
FRIEND LOOK LIKE?

387
00:16:29,103 --> 00:16:31.344
HE'S ON ONE OF
THOSE ELEPHANTS

388
00:16:31,379 --> 00:16:33.344
AND HE LOOKS
JUST LIKE ME.

389
00:16:38,724 --> 00:16:40.482
THAT ONE.

390
00:16:40,517 --> 00:16:42.172
OH.

ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR,
FIVE, SIX LEGS.

393
00:16:48,724 --> 00:16:50.241
THAT WAS GREAT.

394
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:53.241
LET'S GO FIND MORE
RARE JUNGLE ANIMALS.

395
00:16:53,275 --> 00:16:55.965

00:17:20,482 --> 00:17:22.034
SHE'S ON SAFARI, TOO.

406
00:17:22,068 --> 00:17:24.448
MY FRIEND HAS
SPOTS ON HER BACK

407
00:17:24,482 --> 00:17:27.241
STRIPES ON HER BELLY,
AND A LONG TONGUE.

HEY, NOW WE'VE GOT TO GO LOOK
FOR ONE MORE BLUE'S CLUE

423
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:14.758

00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:15.793
LET'S GO.

425
00:18:19,551 --> 00:18:21.068

427
00:18:22,931 --> 00:18:24.793


428
00:18:28,758 --> 00:18:29.758
HEY.

 THINKING CHAIR.THINKING CHAIR. 

462
00:19:41,034 --> 00:19:46.448
NOW THAT WE'RE IN
OUR THINKING CHAIR, LET'S THINK.

463
00:19:46,482 --> 00:19:47.965


464
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49.448
OKAY.

465
00:19:49,482 --> 00:19:52.068
SO, WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

466
00:19:52,103 --> 00:19:57.241
WHAT BLUE WANTS TO PRETEND
TO BE.

467
00:19:57,275 --> 00:20:02.965
OUR CLUES ARE: A HELMET.

468
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05.689
A STAR.

469
00:20:05,724 --> 00:20:08.310

00:20:11,275 --> 00:20:15.241
SO WHAT COULD BLUE PRETEND TO BE

472
00:20:15,275 --> 00:20:19.413
WITH A HELMET,
A STAR AND A ROCKET?

473
00:20:21,241 --> 00:20:27.586
OH, SHE WANTS TO PUT THE HELMET
ON THE STAR AND ROCK IT.

474
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28.896
 NO. 

475
00:20:28,931 --> 00:20:30.965
NO.

476
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33.068
I DIDN'T REALLY THINK SO EITHER.

477
00:20:33,103 --> 00:20:34.724
I WAS JUST... 

478
00:20:37,896 --> 00:20:40.310

485
00:20:53,206 --> 00:20:55.586
