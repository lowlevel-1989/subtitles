101
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,163
WE HAVE OUR FIRST CLUE.

102
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:40,387

103
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,677
 HELMET.

104
00:04:41,709 --> 00:04:43,099

117
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:16,499
OUR FIRST CLUE IS A HELMET.

118
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:21,394
WHAT COULD BLUE PRETEND TO BE
WITH A HELMET?

119
00:05:21,427 --> 00:05:22,915
OH.

120
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:26,520

00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,199
LET'S GO.

123
00:05:31,645 --> 00:05:33,563
THERE'S A STAR.

124
00:05:33,597 --> 00:05:34,556
WHERE?

125
00:05:36,805 --> 00:05:38,260

00:05:49,702 --> 00:05:55,358
SO, UH, YOU SAY YOU CAN SEE
A STAR IN THE DAY TIME.

133
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,911
NO.

135
00:05:59,293 --> 00:06:00,318
DO YOU SEE IT?

136
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,277
OH.

00:06:01,309 --> 00:06:04,154
WELL, UH... HMM.

138
00:06:04,187 --> 00:06:06,899
UH... NO.

139
00:06:06,932 --> 00:06:10,173
YOU WANT TO FIND THE CLOUD

156
00:06:47,343 --> 00:06:48,402
OKAY.

157
00:06:48,435 --> 00:06:50,188
SEE IF WE CAN FIND
THIS ONE.

158
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,866
I DON'T SEE A FISH, DO YOU?

159
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:54,983
 RIGHT THERE.

160
00:06:56,273 --> 00:06:58,125
HEY.

161
00:06:58,158 --> 00:07:00,902

173
00:07:22,729 --> 00:07:24,052
I SEE IT NOW.

174
00:07:24,085 --> 00:07:26,565
THAT CLOUD LOOKS LIKE
AN ELEPHANT, TOO.

175
00:07:28,152 --> 00:07:29,079
SEE?

176
00:07:29,111 --> 00:07:30,401

00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:55,700
Both:
HI.

186
00:07:55,733 --> 00:07:57,156
THIS COULD BE
THE BABY.

187
00:07:57,188 --> 00:07:59,040
OR THIS COULD
BE THE BABY.

188
00:07:59,074 --> 00:08:00,529
WHAT ARE YOU
TWO DOING?

189
00:08:00,561 --> 00:08:02,711
Both:
WE'RE PLAYING HOUSE.

190
00:08:02,744 --> 00:08:03,835
I'M THE MOTHER.

191
00:08:03,869 --> 00:08:04,828
I'M THE FATHER.

192
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:07,870
BLUE, DO YOU WANT
TO BE THE BABY?

193
00:08:09,028 --> 00:08:09,953
STEVE?

194
00:08:09,987 --> 00:08:10,912
WHAT CAN I BE?

195
00:08:10,946 --> 00:08:13,393
YOU CAN BE...
THE HELPER.

196
00:08:15,542 --> 00:08:17,328
THE HELPER.

197
00:08:17,362 --> 00:08:18,287
WOW.

198
00:08:18,321 --> 00:08:20,305
WILL YOU BE
A HELPER, TOO?

199
00:08:20,338 --> 00:08:21,760
YOU WILL?

200
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:24,769
GREAT. THEN WE CAN LOOK
FOR MORE BLUE'S CLUES.

201
00:08:26,886 --> 00:08:28,142

PLAY HOUSE.

202
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:30,093
WHERE'S
OUR HOUSE?

203
00:08:30,127 --> 00:08:33,004
HOW CAN WE PLAY HOUSE
WITHOUT A HOUSE?

204
00:08:33,036 --> 00:08:34,360
OH, OH, OH.

205
00:08:34,392 --> 00:08:37,038

A JOB FOR...

206
00:08:37,071 --> 00:08:40,941

IT'S A HOUSE!

215

CAN BE THE MEATBALLS.
