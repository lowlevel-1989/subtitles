DO YOU KNOW?

123
00:05:36,045 --> 00:05:38,164
WHAT IS THAT A SHADOW OF?

124
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,574
 A TREE!

125
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:43,329

THAT'S JUST
A SHADOW OF A TREE--

129
00:05:49,188 --> 00:05:51,240

BIRD'S NEST, EVEN.

130
00:05:51,274 --> 00:05:52,531

 A BIRDBATH!

139
00:06:18,285 --> 00:06:20,106
Both:
OH!

140
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,795
HEY, WOW!

141
00:06:21,828 --> 00:06:24,410
YOU ARE
SO GOOD AT THIS.

142
00:06:24,443 --> 00:06:26,495
IT'S JUST A SHADOW
OF A BIRDBATH.

143
00:06:26,529 --> 00:06:28,945
THAT'S NOT SCARY EITHER.

144
00:06:28,978 --> 00:06:30,203
ARE YOU READY?

145
00:06:30,236 --> 00:06:33,546
LET'S GO LOOK
FOR MORE BLUE'S CLUES.

146
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,538
 A CLUE, A CLUE.

147
00:06:39,571 --> 00:06:42,220
DID YOU SAY
WHAT I THINK YOU SAID?

148
00:06:42,253 --> 00:06:43,709
A CLUE?

149
00:06:43,743 --> 00:06:46,788

OUR SECOND CLUE.

152
00:06:57,381 --> 00:06:58,904
BUT WHAT IS IT?

153
00:06:58,936 --> 00:06:59,930
 A SHADOW!

154
00:06:59,963 --> 00:07:03,935
OH, A SHADOW, RIGHT.

155
00:07:03,969 --> 00:07:07,146
BUT A SHADOW OF WHAT?

156
00:07:14,628 --> 00:07:16,680
IT'S GONE!

157
00:07:16,714 --> 00:07:17,674
OOH!

158
00:07:17,706 --> 00:07:19,196
WELL, WE BETTER HURRY UP

159
00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:22,109
AND WRITE THIS CLUE DOWN
IN OUR HANDY-DANDY...

160
00:07:22,143 --> 00:07:23,235
 NOTEBOOK.

161
00:07:23,268 --> 00:07:25,718
NOTEBOOK, RIGHT.

162
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:31,114
OKAY, SO... THIS... SHADOW.

163
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,663
CURVE UP HERE.

164
00:07:33,695 --> 00:07:35,814
SORT OF BUMPY AT THE TOP.

165
00:07:35,848 --> 00:07:37,701
A CURVE DOWN HERE.

166
00:07:37,734 --> 00:07:40,648
A WAVY LINE ON THE BOTTOM.

167
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,693
WE HAVE THIS SHADOW.

168
00:07:43,725 --> 00:07:45,183
HMM.

169
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:50,380
SO, WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT BLUE IS AFRAID OF.

170
00:07:51,405 --> 00:07:52,961
WHAT WAS OUR FIRST CLUE?

171
00:07:52,995 --> 00:07:53,921
 A FEATHER.

172
00:07:53,955 --> 00:07:56,703
RIGHT-- A FEATHER.

173
00:07:56,735 --> 00:08:00,575
AND NOW WE HAVE THIS SHADOW.

174
00:08:00,609 --> 00:08:01,965
HMM.

175
00:08:01,999 --> 00:08:05,508
FEATHERS AND THIS SHADOW.

176
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:10,838
WHAT COULD BLUE BE AFRAID OF
WITH FEATHERS AND THIS SHADOW?

177
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:13,916
FEATHERS AND THIS SHADOW?

178
00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:16,399
I THINK WE NEED TO FIND
OUR LAST BLUE'S CLUE.

179
00:08:18,418 --> 00:08:20,338
DO YOU HEAR THAT?

180
00:08:20,371 --> 00:08:23,119
SOUNDS LIKE IT'S COMING FROM...

181
00:08:23,152 --> 00:08:24,079
THE KITCHEN.

182
00:08:24,112 --> 00:08:25,900
LET'S GO.

183
00:08:27,885 --> 00:08:28,813
 Both: 
ALLO!

184
00:08:28,845 --> 00:08:30,634

369
00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:13,336

370
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:15,588
GOT TO GO, BYE!

371
00:17:17,144 --> 00:17:19,096

374
00:17:29,128 --> 00:17:30,253
LET'S GO.

375
00:17:36,874 --> 00:17:38,529
IT'S JUST THE PHONE.

376
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:45,215
HELLO?

377
00:17:45,249 --> 00:17:47,334

378
00:17:47,368 --> 00:17:49,055
Whoo.

379
00:17:49,089 --> 00:17:50,843
WHO IS THIS?

380
00:17:50,876 --> 00:17:52,531

00:17:56,536 --> 00:17:57,596
 A CLUE, A CLUE!

384
00:17:57,629 --> 00:17:58,623
WHO?

385
00:17:58,655 --> 00:18:00,476
Whoo, whoo!

386
00:18:00,509 --> 00:18:02,794
I'LL BE WITH YOU
IN JUST ONE SECOND.

387
00:18:02,826 --> 00:18:05,078
I'M JUST TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT WHO...

388
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,236
 NO, IT'S A CLUE!

389
00:18:06,269 --> 00:18:07,825
A CLUE? YOU SEE A CLUE?

390
00:18:07,858 --> 00:18:10,109
Whoo, whoo.

391
00:18:10,143 --> 00:18:13,618
OH, I SEE A CLUE, TOO.

392
00:18:13,651 --> 00:18:16,068
IT'S THIS SOUND.

393
00:18:16,101 --> 00:18:17,789
WHAT IS THIS SOUND?

394
00:18:17,823 --> 00:18:18,815
Whoo, whoo.

395
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:19,908
 WHOO, WHOO.

396
00:18:19,941 --> 00:18:21,894
WHOO, WHOO, HUH!

397
00:18:21,928 --> 00:18:23,284
Whoo.

398
00:18:23,318 --> 00:18:24,973
OKAY, WE KNOW WHAT TO DO.

399
00:18:25,005 --> 00:18:26,760
PUT IT IN OUR HANDY-DANDY...

400
00:18:26,794 --> 00:18:28,118
 NOTEBOOK.

401
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,170
NOTEBOOK.

402
00:18:30,203 --> 00:18:31,990
HMM, OKAY.

403
00:18:34,506 --> 00:18:38,644
THE SOUND IS KIND OF LIKE THIS.

404
00:18:38,678 --> 00:18:42,120
LOTS OF CIRCLES, LIKE "Os".

405
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:48,476
AND WE HAVE "WHOO"
AS OUR THIRD CLUE.

406
00:18:48,509 --> 00:18:50,330
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?

407
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:52,150
WE'RE READY FOR OUR...

408
00:18:52,184 --> 00:18:53,243
 THINKING CHAIR!

409
00:18:53,276 --> 00:18:54,269
THINKING CHAIR.

410
00:18:54,303 --> 00:18:55,660
COME ON.

411
00:18:58,408 --> 00:19:04,696
OKAY, NOW THAT WE'RE IN
OUR THINKING CHAIR, LET'S THINK.

412
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:05,855
ALL RIGHT.

413
00:19:05,889 --> 00:19:08,934
SO, WE NEED
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT...

414
00:19:10,324 --> 00:19:13,768
WHAT BLUE IS AFRAID OF.

415
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:18,733
AND OUR CLUES ARE A FEATHER...

416
00:19:18,765 --> 00:19:23,996
THIS SHADOW...

417
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:30,319
AND THIS SOUND: WHOO, WHOO.

418
00:19:30,352 --> 00:19:34,920
HMM, SO WHAT COULD
BLUE BE AFRAID OF

419
00:19:34,954 --> 00:19:38,893
THAT HAS FEATHERS, THIS SHADOW

420
00:19:38,925 --> 00:19:43,096
AND MAKES THE SOUND
"WHOO, WHOO?"

421
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:46,143
WELL, MAYBE...

422
00:19:46,175 --> 00:19:49,850
MAYBE BLUE'S AFRAID
OF A SHADOW-DANCING FEATHER.

423
00:19:51,405 --> 00:19:52,399
WHOO, WHOO.

424
00:19:52,432 --> 00:19:53,458
WHOO, WHOO.

425
00:19:53,491 --> 00:19:54,451
 
NO.

426
00:19:56,438 --> 00:19:59,946
NO, THAT'S NOT SCARY.

427
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:05,674
WELL, WHAT COULD BLUE
BE AFRAID OF THAT HAS FEATHERS

428
00:20:05,706 --> 00:20:07,494
A SHADOW THAT LOOKS LIKE THIS

429
00:20:07,528 --> 00:20:13,089
AND MAKES THE SOUND
"WHOO, WHOO"?

430
00:20:13,121 --> 00:20:15,208
WELL, A BIRD HAS FEATHERS.

431
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,160
BUT WHAT KIND OF BIRD...

432
00:20:17,194 --> 00:20:18,584
 AN OWL!

433
00:20:18,616 --> 00:20:19,709
AN OWL?

434
00:20:21,663 --> 00:20:23,649
AN OWL.

435
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:24,675
THAT'S IT!

436
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:26,463
THAT'S BRILLIANT.

437
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:31,693
AN OWL HAS FEATHERS
AND ITS SHADOW LOOKS LIKE THIS

438
00:20:31,725 --> 00:20:35,830

"WHOO, WHOO."
