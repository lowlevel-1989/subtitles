OH, OKAY, SO WHAT BOOK
DO YOU THINK HE BELONGS IN?

186
00:08:57,383 --> 00:08:58,850

187
00:08:58,883 --> 00:09:03,183
OH, WELL, WHAT'S
THE NAME OF HIS BOOK?

188
00:09:03,217 --> 00:09:05,917
JACK AND THE BEANSTALK!

189
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:08,483
 OH, YEAH, JACK AND 
 THE BEANSTALK, RIGHT

190
00:09:08,517 --> 00:09:10,950
BECAUSE THE BOY

191
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:14,683
THAT GREW INTO A GREAT,
BIG BEANSTALK, REMEMBER?

192
00:09:14,717 --> 00:09:16,817
OKAY, HERE'S YOUR BOOK.

197
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:29,983
Girl:
STEVE...

198
00:09:30,017 --> 00:09:31,983
STEVE.

199
00:09:34,017 --> 00:09:38,783
OH, NO, I THINK I'M
A LITTLE LOST, TOO.

WELL, SHE'S...

204
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,417
 SWEEPING!

205
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:55,483
SWEEPING, RIGHT.

206
00:09:59,283 --> 00:10:02,383
WELL, FIRST SHE WAS
SWEEPING, AND NOW SHE'S...

207
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,883
 DANCING.

208
00:10:04,917 --> 00:10:06,917
DANCING.

209
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:09,683
YEAH.

210
00:10:09,717 --> 00:10:13,917
SO, WHAT BOOK DO YOU THINK
SHE BELONGS IN?

211
00:10:18,817 --> 00:10:22,217
 THAT ONE.

212
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,817
THIS ONE?

213
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:27,217
WELL, WHAT'S THE NAME
OF HER BOOK?

214
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,850
CINDERELLA!

215
00:10:28,883 --> 00:10:31,417
OH, RIGHT, CINDERELLA.

216
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:33,617
DO YOU MEAN
YOU'RE CINDERELLA?

217
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:35,317
YES.

218
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,783
WOW.

219
00:10:36,817 --> 00:10:40,983
SHE REALLY IS CINDERELLA,
REMEMBER, BECAUSE SHE SWEEPS UP

220
00:10:41,017 --> 00:10:44,050
AND THEN SHE GOES
TO THE BALL AND DANCES.

221
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:46,783
BUT THEY WON'T LET
ME GO TO THE BALL.

222
00:10:46,817 --> 00:10:50,750
OH, WELL, DON'T
GIVE UP, CINDERELLA.

223
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:54,517

00:12:03,117 --> 00:12:06,050
HI, STEVE!

246
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:07,550
WE'RE ACTING OUT A STORY.

247
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,350
IT'S "THE THREE LITTLE PIGS."

248
00:12:09,383 --> 00:12:12,783
LITTLE PIGS,
LITTLE PIGS,
LET ME COME IN.

249
00:12:12,817 --> 00:12:15,617
NOT BY THE HAIR
OF OUR CHIN-Y CHIN, CHIN.

250
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:17,983
THEN I'LL HUFF,
AND I'LL PUFF

251
00:12:18,017 --> 00:12:20,517
AND I'LL BLOW
YOUR HOUSE DOWN.

252
00:12:25,317 --> 00:12:27,283
YOU CAN'T BLOW
OUR HOUSE DOWN.

253
00:12:27,317 --> 00:12:30,050
IT'S MADE
OUT OF BRICKS.

254
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:34,117
I GIVE UP.

255
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:38,383
All:
THE END.

256
00:12:38,417 --> 00:12:40,350
BYE.

257
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:49,250
 A CLUE!

258
00:12:49,283 --> 00:12:51,783
A CLUE?

259
00:12:51,817 --> 00:12:54,150
WHERE? WHERE'S THE CLUE?

260
00:12:54,183 --> 00:12:56,750

CHAIR, RIGHT.

265
00:13:05,517 --> 00:13:06,583
A LITTLE CHAIR.

266
00:13:06,617 --> 00:13:07,317
YEAH.

267
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,550

 NOTEBOOK!

271
00:13:12,817 --> 00:13:14,283
NOTEBOOK.

00:13:14,317 --> 00:13:18,550
OKAY, SO, WE HAVE A CHAIR.

273
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:23,783
START WITH TWO CIRCLES...

274
00:13:23,817 --> 00:13:27,050
LINES FOR THE BACK.

275
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:31,983
KIND OF A RECTANGLE
FOR THE SEAT AND LEGS.

276
00:13:34,317 --> 00:13:37,650
AND WE HAVE A CHAIR.

277
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:38,817
WHAT WAS OUR FIRST CLUE?

278
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:39,817
 A BOWL!

279
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:40,817
 A BOWL.

280
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:43,550
OH, RIGHT, A BOWL.

281
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:47,750
AND OUR SECOND CLUE IS A CHAIR?

282
00:13:47,783 --> 00:13:50,850
A BOWL AND A CHAIR?

283
00:13:50,883 --> 00:13:58,350
OH, WHAT STORY COULD BLUE WANT
TO PLAY WITH A BOWL AND A CHAIR?

284
00:13:58,383 --> 00:14:00,883
I THINK WE BETTER FIND
OUR LAST BLUE'S CLUE.

285
00:14:00,917 --> 00:14:02,350

00:14:27,183 --> 00:14:28,517
AND BLUE NEEDS TO BE

295
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,183

00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,383
THAT'S ME.

309
00:15:01,417 --> 00:15:03,750
"WHO FOUND
A GREEN-STRIPED COOKIE."

310
00:15:03,783 --> 00:15:07,150
OOH, LOOK AT THAT
GREEN-STRIPED COOKIE.

311
00:15:07,183 --> 00:15:08,150
"THE COOKIE..."

312
00:15:08,183 --> 00:15:09,150
COOKIE.

313
00:15:09,183 --> 00:15:10,617
"MADE THE KING..."

314
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:11,517
THAT'S ME.

315
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,183
"SO JOLLY

316
00:15:13,217 --> 00:15:14,517
HAPPY, HAPPY, HAPPY.

317
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:15,717
"THAT THE KING..."

318
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,783
THAT'S ME.

319
00:15:16,817 --> 00:15:18,850
"DANCED ALL AROUND
THE KINGDOM."

320
00:15:18,883 --> 00:15:20,850
LOOK OUT, KINGDOM,
HERE I COME.

321
00:15:20,883 --> 00:15:22,850
I'M HOPPING-ALL-OVER KING.

322
00:15:22,883 --> 00:15:23,850
 NO!

323
00:15:23,883 --> 00:15:24,917
UH, KING?

324
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,717
WHAT CAN I DO
FOR YOU, BUNNY?

325
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,917
THAT'S NOT THE WAY
THE STORY GOES.

326
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:29,917
LISTEN.

327
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:36,717
"THE HAPPY KING DANCED
ALL AROUND THE KINGDOM."

328
00:15:42,117 --> 00:15:43,683
NOW, THAT'S HOW IT GOES.

329
00:15:43,717 --> 00:15:45,283
LOOK AT ME, I'M DANCING.

330
00:15:45,317 --> 00:15:46,417
I'M ALL SHOOK UP.

THAT'S ME.

333
00:15:49,117 --> 00:15:51,217
"PUT HIS FAVORITE

00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,217
COOKIE.

335
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,217
"IN HIS POCKET
FOR LATER."

336
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,817
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
GREEN-STRIPED COOKIE

337
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:57,983
YOU LOOK SO GOOD

338
00:15:58,017 --> 00:16:00,550
THE KING'S GOING
TO EAT YOU UP RIGHT NOW.

339
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:01,550
NO.

340
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:02,617
AHEM!

341
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:03,750
NOT NOW, BUNNY.

342
00:16:03,783 --> 00:16:05,483
THE KING'S EATING
HIS COOKIE.

343
00:16:05,517 --> 00:16:07,683
THAT'S NOT THE WAY
THE STORY GOES.

344
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:09,850
LISTEN.

345
00:16:09,883 --> 00:16:12,417
"THE HAPPY KING PUT
HIS FAVORITE COOKIE

346
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:15,317

FOR LATER."

347
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,383
COOKIE.

348
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,917
ALL RIGHT, NOW.

00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,083
"BUT SUDDENLY,
THE KING'S..."

350
00:16:27,117 --> 00:16:28,150
THAT'S ME.

351
00:16:28,183 --> 00:16:29,483
"LITTLE SISTER..."

352
00:16:29,517 --> 00:16:30,883
OOH, THAT'S HER.

353
00:16:30,917 --> 00:16:33,283
"CAME IN AND SAW
THAT THERE WERE

354
00:16:33,317 --> 00:16:36,717
"NO MORE GREEN-STRIPED

00:16:39,983 --> 00:16:41,717
THE KING
STOPPED DANCING."

357
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,150
OH, DARLING.

358
00:16:45,183 --> 00:16:46,250
OH, I SEE.

359
00:16:46,283 --> 00:16:48,117
KING'S LITTLE SISTER'S
CRYING

360
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,050
BECAUSE THE KING--
THAT'S ME--

361
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,783
ATE THE LAST
GREEN-STRIPED COOKIE.

362
00:16:52,817 --> 00:16:55,217
YOU'RE NOT REALLY CRYING,
ARE YOU, BLUE?

363
