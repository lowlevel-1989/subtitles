00:11:41,328 --> 00:11:44,762
A GRANDFATHER CLOCK.

242
00:11:44,795 --> 00:11:47,727
FIRST WE HAVE A SQUARE...

243
00:11:47,762 --> 00:11:49,962
THEN TWO LINES DOWN...

244
00:11:49,995 --> 00:11:52,128
A RECTANGLE FOR THE BOTTOM...

245
00:11:52,162 --> 00:11:54,828
A SQUIGGLY LINE HERE...

246
00:11:54,862 --> 00:11:56,295
CIRCLE FOR THE FACE...

247
00:11:56,328 --> 00:11:58,195

255
00:12:24,795 --> 00:12:27,462
WE REALLY NEED TO FIND

261
00:12:39,495 --> 00:12:41,728
All:

267
00:12:49,562 --> 00:12:52,995
JULIA SAYS WE NEED
TO SOLVE HER RIDDLES
TO GO THROUGH THE TOLL.

268
00:12:53,028 --> 00:12:56,862

00:13:08,728 --> 00:13:11,494
A DUCK SAYS,
"QUACK, QUACK."

275
00:13:11,528 --> 00:13:13,395
A SHEEP SAYS...?

276
00:13:13,428 --> 00:13:17,528
A SHEEP SAYS, "CHUGGA, CHUGGA,
CHUGGA, CHUGGA, WHOO, WHOO"?

277
00:13:17,562 --> 00:13:20,527

278
00:13:20,562 --> 00:13:23,595
A SHEEP
SAYS,
"BAA, BAA"?

279
00:13:23,627 --> 00:13:27,228
WHICH IS THE END
TO JULIA'S RIDDLE?

280
00:13:27,262 --> 00:13:30,028
A DUCK SAYS,
"QUACK, QUACK"

281
00:13:30,062 --> 00:13:31,995
AND A SHEEP SAYS...

282
00:13:32,027 --> 00:13:34,928
 "BAA, BAA."

283
00:13:34,962 --> 00:13:37,127
OH, YEAH, THAT'S IT.

284
00:13:37,162 --> 00:13:39,995
A DUCK SAYS,
"QUACK, QUACK"

285
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:43,128
AND A SHEEP SAYS,
"BAA, BAA."

286
00:13:43,162 --> 00:13:46,995
GREAT.
YOU MAY PASS THROUGH.

287
00:13:47,028 --> 00:13:49,261
All:
WE WANT TO GO

WHEN YOU'RE SAD, YOU...?

295
00:14:06,628 --> 00:14:09,862
WHEN YOU'RE SAD,
YOU SMILE?

296
00:14:09,895 --> 00:14:12,695
WHEN
YOU'RE SAD,
YOU FROWN?

297
00:14:12,728 --> 00:14:17,827
WHEN YOU'RE SAD,
YOU SNORE?

298
00:14:17,862 --> 00:14:20,862
HMM... HOW DOES
THIS ONE END?

299
00:14:20,895 --> 00:14:24,528
WHEN YOU'RE HAPPY,

302
00:14:29,162 --> 00:14:30,961
YEAH, THAT'S IT,
FROWN.

303
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:36,728
HAPPY PEOPLE SMILE
AND SAD PEOPLE FROWN.

304
00:14:36,762 --> 00:14:38,627
GO ON THROUGH.

305
00:14:40,695 --> 00:14:42,895

315
00:15:16,494 --> 00:15:18,795
AROUND THIS BOOK.

316
00:15:18,828 --> 00:15:20,495
...RHYMES

317
00:15:20,528 --> 00:15:22,262
NO, THAT'S
NOT IT.

318
00:15:22,295 --> 00:15:23,762
HI THERE, SHEEP.

319
00:15:23,794 --> 00:15:25,262

00:15:26,428 --> 00:15:27,595
HI, BLUE.

322
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:29,595
I'M MAKING A POEM.

323
00:15:29,627 --> 00:15:32,495
YOU ARE? GREAT!

324
00:15:32,528 --> 00:15:34,295
IS IT A RHYMING POEM?

325
00:15:34,328 --> 00:15:35,228
YES.

326
00:15:35,262 --> 00:15:37,228
THAT'S WHAT I
NEED HELP WITH:

327
00:15:37,262 --> 00:15:38,394
THE RHYMING PART.

328
00:15:38,428 --> 00:15:40,661
WILL YOU HELP ME
FINISH MY RHYMES?

329
00:15:40,695 --> 00:15:43,295

00:15:43,328 --> 00:15:44,594
WILL YOU HELP, TOO?

331
00:15:44,628 --> 00:15:46,862
I HEAR YOU'RE
AN EXCELLENT RHYMER.

332
00:15:46,895 --> 00:15:49,695
WELL, THE FIRST LINE
OF MY POEM IS

333
00:15:49,728 --> 00:15:54,662
"THERE ONCE WAS A FOX
ON A BOX PLAYING WITH...

334
00:15:54,695 --> 00:15:58,028
I NEED A WORD THAT
RHYMES WITH FOX AND BOX.

335
00:15:58,062 --> 00:16:02,228
Steve:
HMM, FOX, BOX, CARS?

336
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:05,528
FOX, BOX, PAINTS?

337
00:16:05,562 --> 00:16:09,528
FOX, BOX, BLOCKS?
HMM...

338
00:16:09,562 --> 00:16:12,628
WHICH THREE WORDS
RHYME?

339
00:16:12,662 --> 00:16:15,628
 FOX, BOX, BLOCKS.

340
00:16:15,662 --> 00:16:19,495
OH! FOX,
BOX, BLOCKS!

341
00:16:19,528 --> 00:16:21,462
THEY RHYME
PERFECTLY.

342
00:16:21,495 --> 00:16:23,262
BLOCKS, YES.

343
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,662
THANKS, STEVE.

344
00:16:24,695 --> 00:16:27,328
SO THE FIRST LINE
OF MY POEM IS

345
00:16:27,362 --> 00:16:29,895
"THERE ONCE WAS A FOX
ON A BOX

346
00:16:29,928 --> 00:16:31,795
PLAYING WITH BLOCKS."

347
00:16:31,828 --> 00:16:33,861
HERE'S MY SECOND LINE.

348
00:16:33,895 --> 00:16:38,495
"ALONG CAME A GOAT,
RIDING IN A...
DRESSED IN A..."

349
00:16:38,528 --> 00:16:41,395
I NEED TWO WORDS
THAT RHYME WITH GOAT.

350
00:16:41,428 --> 00:16:42,662
HMM.

351
00:16:42,695 --> 00:16:45,762
DO YOU SEE TWO WORDS
THAT RHYME WITH GOAT?

352
00:16:45,795 --> 00:16:49,528
GOAT RIDING IN A...

353

 BOAT!

354
00:16:51,661 --> 00:16:54,862
DRESSED IN A...

00:16:54,895 --> 00:16:56,228
 COAT!

356
00:16:56,262 --> 00:16:57,962
GREAT!

357
00:16:57,995 --> 00:17:00,095
BOAT AND COAT.

358
00:17:00,128 --> 00:17:02,728
WE FIGURED OUT
THE WHOLE SECOND LINE.

359
00:17:02,762 --> 00:17:06,495
OKAY, SO HOW MUCH OF THE POEM
HAVE WE FINISHED NOW?

360
00:17:08,562 --> 00:17:12,461
"THERE ONCE WAS A FOX ON A BOX
PLAYING WITH BLOCKS.

361
00:17:12,495 --> 00:17:16,595
THEN ALONG CAME A GOAT, RIDING
IN A BOAT, DRESSED IN A COAT."

362
00:17:16,628 --> 00:17:20,062
WE NEED ONE MORE LINE
TO FINISH THIS POEM.

363
00:17:21,562 --> 00:17:25,395
"SO THE FOX JUMPED OFF THE BOX,
PUT ON ONE SHOE

364
00:17:25,428 --> 00:17:28,327
AND PADDLED AFTER THE GOAT
IN A..."

365
00:17:28,362 --> 00:17:30,328
HMM.

366
00:17:30,362 --> 00:17:33,862
DO YOU SEE WHAT THE FOX
COULD RIDE IN

367
00:17:33,894 --> 00:17:36,128
THAT RHYMES WITH SHOE?

368
00:17:39,262 --> 00:17:40,395
 BLUE CANOE.

369
00:17:40,428 --> 00:17:41,962
 BLUE CANOE.

370
00:17:41,995 --> 00:17:46,695
RIGHT, BLUE CANOE RHYMES
WITH SHOE.

371
00:17:46,728 --> 00:17:47,761
BRILLIANT.

372
00:17:47,795 --> 00:17:49,995
BLUE CANOE,
THAT'S PERFECT!

373
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:51,895
WE'RE DONE.

374
00:17:51,928 --> 00:17:53,595
LET'S READ OUR POEM
TOGETHER.

375
00:17:53,628 --> 00:17:56,527
"ONCE THERE WAS
A FOX ON A BOX
PLAYING WITH..."

376
00:17:56,562 --> 00:17:57,762
 BLOCKS.

377
00:17:57,795 --> 00:18:00,428
"THEN ALONG CAME A GOAT,
RIDING IN A..."

378
00:18:00,462 --> 00:18:01,562
 BOAT!

379
00:18:01,595 --> 00:18:02,595
"DRESSED IN A..."

380
00:18:02,628 --> 00:18:03,962
 COAT!

381
00:18:03,995 --> 00:18:07,528
"AND THE FOX JUMPED
OFF THE BOX,
PUT ON ONE SHOE

382
00:18:07,561 --> 00:18:09,728
AND PADDLED
AFTER THE GOAT IN A..."

383
00:18:09,761 --> 00:18:11,062
BLUE CANOE!

384
00:18:11,095 --> 00:18:13,428
THANKS FOR HELPING ME.

385
00:18:13,462 --> 00:18:14,762
HEY, YOU'RE WELCOME.

386
00:18:14,795 --> 00:18:17,928
BUT, UH...
DID YOU SEE

387
00:18:17,961 --> 00:18:20,662
WHICH WAY
MY PUPPY WENT?

388
00:18:20,695 --> 00:18:22,595
DIDN'T SHE JUMP
IN THAT CANOE?

389
00:18:22,627 --> 00:18:26,062
NO, THAT WAS FOX.

390
00:18:33,495 --> 00:18:36,127
OOH! GAD! YOU...

391
00:18:36,162 --> 00:18:37,628

394
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,794
 NO, A CLUE.

395
00:18:43,828 --> 00:18:47,261
THIS?
OH, THAT'S
NOT BLUE.

396
00:18:47,295 --> 00:18:49,727
THAT'S
JUST A CLUE.

397
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:51,727
HEY... THIS MOUSE

398
00:18:51,762 --> 00:18:55,262

PAW PRINT ON IT.

399
00:18:55,295 --> 00:18:57,695
SHE'S A CLUE.

400
00:18:57,728 --> 00:18:59,728
A BLUE'S CLUE.

401
00:18:59,761 --> 00:19:02,028
WELL, YOU KNOW

410
00:19:26,662 --> 00:19:28,395
LINES FOR THE WHISKERS...

411
00:19:28,428 --> 00:19:31,995
AND A LONG, SQUIGGLY LINE
FOR THE TAIL. THERE.

412
00:19:32,028 --> 00:19:33,362
A MOUSE.

413
00:19:36,828 --> 00:19:40,994
WELL, WE HAVE
ALL THREE CLUES.

414
00:19:41,028 --> 00:19:42,562

00:19:44,395 --> 00:19:45,862
WE'RE READY FOR OUR...

417
00:19:45,895 --> 00:19:48,095
THINKING CHAIR! COME ON.

ALL RIGHT.

422
00:20:06,727 --> 00:20:12,595
NOW THAT WE'RE IN OUR...
THINKING CHAIR, LET'S THINK.

423
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:19,128
OKAY, SO, WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT TICKETY'S FAVORITE
NURSERY RHYME IS

424
00:20:19,162 --> 00:20:21,327
AND OUR BLUE'S CLUES ARE

425
00:20:21,362 --> 00:20:25,395
A NUMBER "1"...

426
00:20:25,427 --> 00:20:28,295
A CLOCK...

427
00:20:28,328 --> 00:20:32,062

430
00:20:44,195 --> 00:20:45,862
HMM...

431
00:20:45,895 --> 00:20:53,495
OOH, COULD IT BE THE CLOCK
THAT STRUCK 1:00 AND WAS
AFRAID OF A MOUSE?

432
00:20:53,528 --> 00:20:55,695
 NO.

433
00:20:55,727 --> 00:20:57,094
NO.

434
00:20:57,128 --> 00:21:03,228
WELL, WHAT RHYME IS ABOUT
A CLOCK THAT STRIKES 1:00

435
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:07,695
AND A MOUSE RUNNING
UP AND DOWN, OR...

436
00:21:07,728 --> 00:21:09,494

442
00:21:17,862 --> 00:21:20,695
THE NUMBER "1"
FOR "THE CLOCK STRIKES 1:00."
