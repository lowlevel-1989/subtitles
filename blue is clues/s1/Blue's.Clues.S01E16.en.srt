00:08:22,733 --> 00:08:25.200

00:08:25,233 --> 00:08:27.100
HE SEEMS TO BE FEELING...

191
00:08:27,133 --> 00:08:28.733
 HAPPY! 

192
00:08:28,767 --> 00:08:30.333

00:08:33,967 --> 00:08:37.567
HEY, WHAT 
ARE THOSE?

195
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38.933
THEY LOOK LIKE...

196
00:08:38,967 --> 00:08:39.933
 BEANS. 

197
00:08:39,967 --> 00:08:41.167
BEANS, YEAH.

198
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42.567

OH, WELL, WHAT'S
THE NAME OF HIS BOOK?

202
00:09:01,367 --> 00:09:04.067
JACK AND THE BEANSTALK!

203
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06.633
 OH, YEAH, JACK AND 
 THE BEANSTALK, RIGHT

204
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:09.100

212
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:30.133
STEVE.

213
00:09:32,167 --> 00:09:36.933
OH, NO, I THINK I'M
A LITTLE LOST, TOO.

WELL, SHE'S...

218
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51.567
 SWEEPING! 

219
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53.633
SWEEPING, RIGHT.

220
00:09:53,667 --> 00:09:57.400


221
00:09:57,433 --> 00:10:00.533
WELL, FIRST SHE WAS
SWEEPING, AND NOW SHE'S...

222
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03.033
 DANCING. 

223
00:10:03,067 --> 00:10:05.067
DANCING.

224
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07.833
YEAH.

225
00:10:07,867 --> 00:10:12.067
SO, WHAT BOOK DO YOU THINK
SHE BELONGS IN?

226
00:10:16,967 --> 00:10:20.367
 THAT ONE. 

227
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21.967
THIS ONE?

228
00:10:23,067 --> 00:10:25.367
WELL, WHAT'S THE NAME
OF HER BOOK?

229
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27.000
CINDERELLA!

230
00:10:27,033 --> 00:10:29.567
OH, RIGHT, CINDERELLA. 

231
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31.767
DO YOU MEAN
YOU'RE CINDERELLA?

232
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33.467
YES.

233
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34.933
WOW.

234
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:39.133
SHE REALLY IS CINDERELLA,
REMEMBER, BECAUSE SHE SWEEPS UP

235
00:10:39,167 --> 00:10:42.200
AND THEN SHE GOES
TO THE BALL AND DANCES.

236
00:10:42,233 --> 00:10:44.933
BUT THEY WON'T LET
ME GO TO THE BALL.

237
00:10:44,967 --> 00:10:48.900
OH, WELL, DON'T
GIVE UP, CINDERELLA.

238
00:10:48,933 --> 00:10:52.667

260
00:12:01,267 --> 00:12:04.200
HI, STEVE!

261
00:12:04,233 --> 00:12:05.700
WE'RE ACTING OUT A STORY.

262
00:12:05,733 --> 00:12:07.500
IT'S "THE THREE LITTLE PIGS."

263
00:12:07,533 --> 00:12:10.933
LITTLE PIGS,
LITTLE PIGS,
LET ME COME IN.

264
00:12:10,967 --> 00:12:13.767
NOT BY THE HAIR
OF OUR CHIN-Y CHIN, CHIN.

265
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16.133
THEN I'LL HUFF,
AND I'LL PUFF

266
00:12:16,167 --> 00:12:18.667
AND I'LL BLOW
YOUR HOUSE DOWN.

267
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21.767


268
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23.433


269
00:12:23,467 --> 00:12:25.433
YOU CAN'T BLOW
OUR HOUSE DOWN.

270
00:12:25,467 --> 00:12:28.200
IT'S MADE
OUT OF BRICKS.

271
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32.267
I GIVE UP.

272
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34.467


273
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36.533
All:
THE END.

274
00:12:36,567 --> 00:12:38.500
BYE.

275
00:12:38,533 --> 00:12:40.933


276
00:12:44,667 --> 00:12:47.400
 A CLUE! 

277
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49.933
A CLUE?

278
00:12:49,967 --> 00:12:52.300
WHERE? WHERE'S THE CLUE?

CHAIR, RIGHT.

284
00:13:03,667 --> 00:13:04.733
A LITTLE CHAIR.

285
00:13:04,767 --> 00:13:05.467
YEAH.

286
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06.700

OKAY, SO, WE HAVE A CHAIR.

292
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:21.933
START WITH TWO CIRCLES...

293
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:25.200
LINES FOR THE BACK.

294
00:13:25,233 --> 00:13:30.133
KIND OF A RECTANGLE
FOR THE SEAT AND LEGS.

295
00:13:32,467 --> 00:13:35.800
AND WE HAVE A CHAIR.

296
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:36.967
WHAT WAS OUR FIRST CLUE?

297
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37.967
 A BOWL! 

298
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38.967
 A BOWL. 

299
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41.700
OH, RIGHT, A BOWL.

300
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:45.900
AND OUR SECOND CLUE IS A CHAIR?

301
00:13:45,933 --> 00:13:49.000
A BOWL AND A CHAIR?

302
00:13:49,033 --> 00:13:56.500
OH, WHAT STORY COULD BLUE WANT
TO PLAY WITH A BOWL AND A CHAIR?

303
00:13:56,533 --> 00:13:59.033
I THINK WE BETTER FIND
OUR LAST BLUE'S CLUE.

304
00:13:59,067 --> 00:14:00.500

00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:26.667
AND BLUE NEEDS TO BE

315
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28.333
THE KING'S

331
00:15:01,933 --> 00:15:05.300
OOH, LOOK AT THAT
GREEN-STRIPED COOKIE.

332
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:06.300
"THE COOKIE..."

333
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:07.300
COOKIE.

334
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:08.767
"MADE THE KING..."

335
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09.667
THAT'S ME.

336
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11.333
"SO JOLLY

THAT'S ME.

340
00:15:14,967 --> 00:15:17.000
"DANCED ALL AROUND
THE KINGDOM."

341
00:15:17,033 --> 00:15:19.000
LOOK OUT, KINGDOM,
HERE I COME.

342
00:15:19,033 --> 00:15:21.000
I'M HOPPING-ALL-OVER KING.

343
00:15:21,033 --> 00:15:22.000
 NO! 

344
00:15:22,033 --> 00:15:23.067
UH, KING?

345
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24.867
WHAT CAN I DO
FOR YOU, BUNNY?

346
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27.067
THAT'S NOT THE WAY
THE STORY GOES.

347
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28.067
LISTEN.

348
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29.867


349
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:34.867
"THE HAPPY KING DANCED
ALL AROUND THE KINGDOM."

350
00:15:39,133 --> 00:15:40.233


351
00:15:40,267 --> 00:15:41.833
NOW, THAT'S HOW IT GOES.

352
00:15:41,867 --> 00:15:43.433
LOOK AT ME, I'M DANCING.

357
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50.367
COOKIE.

358
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52.367
"IN HIS POCKET
FOR LATER."

359
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54.967
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
GREEN-STRIPED COOKIE

360
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56.133
YOU LOOK SO GOOD

361
00:15:56,167 --> 00:15:58.700
THE KING'S GOING
TO EAT YOU UP RIGHT NOW.

362
00:15:58,733 --> 00:15:59.700
NO.

363
00:15:59,733 --> 00:16:00.767
AHEM!

364
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01.900
NOT NOW, BUNNY.

365
00:16:01,933 --> 00:16:03.633
THE KING'S EATING
HIS COOKIE.

366
00:16:03,667 --> 00:16:05.833
THAT'S NOT THE WAY
THE STORY GOES.

367
00:16:05,867 --> 00:16:08.000
LISTEN.
