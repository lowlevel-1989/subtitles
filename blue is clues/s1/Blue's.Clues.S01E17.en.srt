00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:22,575
FIRST WE HAVE A SQUARE...

243
00:11:22,608 --> 00:11:24,718
THEN TWO LINES DOWN...

244
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,795
A RECTANGLE FOR THE BOTTOM...

245
00:11:26,828 --> 00:11:29,385
A SQUIGGLY LINE HERE...

00:12:42,943 --> 00:12:44,734
A SHEEP SAYS...?

276
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:48,697
A SHEEP SAYS, "CHUGGA, CHUGGA,

WHICH IS THE END
TO JULIA'S RIDDLE?

280
00:12:58,033 --> 00:13:00,685
A DUCK SAYS,

281
00:13:00,718 --> 00:13:02,572
AND A SHEEP SAYS...

282
00:13:02,603 --> 00:13:05,385
 "BAA, BAA."

283
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:07,494
OH, YEAH, THAT'S IT.

284
00:13:07,527 --> 00:13:10,244
A DUCK SAYS,
"QUACK, QUACK"

285
00:13:10,276 --> 00:13:13,249
AND A SHEEP SAYS,
"BAA, BAA."

286
00:13:13,281 --> 00:13:16,957
GREAT.

WHEN YOU'RE SAD,
YOU SMILE?

296
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:41,605
WHEN
YOU'RE SAD,
YOU FROWN?

297
00:13:41,636 --> 00:13:46,527
WHEN YOU'RE SAD,
YOU SNORE?

298
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,437
HMM... HOW DOES
THIS ONE END?

299
00:13:49,469 --> 00:13:52,953

304
00:14:04,686 --> 00:14:06,475
GO ON THROUGH.

305
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:10,568

316
00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:46,628
...RHYMES

317
00:14:46,659 --> 00:14:48,322

318
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:49,761
HI THERE, SHEEP.

319
00:14:49,792 --> 00:14:51,199

HI, BLUE.

322
00:14:53,468 --> 00:14:55,355
I'M MAKING A POEM.

323
00:14:55,386 --> 00:14:58,136
YOU ARE? GREAT!

324
00:14:58,168 --> 00:14:59,862
IS IT A RHYMING POEM?

325
00:14:59,894 --> 00:15:00,757
YES.

326
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,675
THAT'S WHAT I
NEED HELP WITH:

327
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:03,794
THE RHYMING PART.

328
00:15:03,826 --> 00:15:05,968
WILL YOU HELP ME

WILL YOU HELP, TOO?

331
00:15:09,772 --> 00:15:11,915
I HEAR YOU'RE
AN EXCELLENT RHYMER.

332
00:15:11,946 --> 00:15:14,632
WELL, THE FIRST LINE
OF MY POEM IS

333
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:19,395
"THERE ONCE WAS A FOX
ON A BOX PLAYING WITH...

334
00:15:19,427 --> 00:15:22,623
I NEED A WORD THAT
RHYMES WITH FOX AND BOX.

335
00:15:22,656 --> 00:15:26,651
Steve:
HMM, FOX, BOX, CARS?

00:15:26,684 --> 00:15:29,816

00:15:33,685 --> 00:15:36,625
WHICH THREE WORDS
RHYME?

339
00:15:36,658 --> 00:15:39,502
 FOX, BOX, BLOCKS.

340
00:15:39,535 --> 00:15:43,211
OH! FOX,
BOX, BLOCKS!

341
00:15:43,243 --> 00:15:45,097
THEY RHYME
PERFECTLY.

342
00:15:45,129 --> 00:15:46,824
BLOCKS, YES.

343
00:15:46,855 --> 00:15:48,166
THANKS, STEVE.

344
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:50,723
SO THE FIRST LINE

345
00:15:50,756 --> 00:15:53,185
"THERE ONCE WAS A FOX
ON A BOX

346
00:15:53,217 --> 00:15:55,007
PLAYING WITH BLOCKS."

347
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:56,989
HERE'S MY SECOND LINE.

348
00:15:57,021 --> 00:16:01,433
"ALONG CAME A GOAT,
RIDING IN A...

349
00:16:01,464 --> 00:16:04,214
I NEED TWO WORDS

00:16:04,246 --> 00:16:05,429
HMM.

351
00:16:05,461 --> 00:16:08,402
DO YOU SEE TWO WORDS

352
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:12,014
GOAT RIDING IN A...

 COAT!

356
00:16:18,472 --> 00:16:20,102

357
00:16:20,134 --> 00:16:22,148
BOAT AND COAT.

358
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,673
WE FIGURED OUT
THE WHOLE SECOND LINE.

359
00:16:24,706 --> 00:16:28,286
OKAY, SO HOW MUCH OF THE POEM
HAVE WE FINISHED NOW?

360
00:16:30,268 --> 00:16:34,008
"THERE ONCE WAS A FOX ON A BOX
PLAYING WITH BLOCKS.

361
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,972
THEN ALONG CAME A GOAT, RIDING
IN A BOAT, DRESSED IN A COAT."

362
00:16:38,004 --> 00:16:41,297
WE NEED ONE MORE LINE
TO FINISH THIS POEM.

363
00:16:42,736 --> 00:16:46,412
"SO THE FOX JUMPED OFF THE BOX,
PUT ON ONE SHOE

364
00:16:46,443 --> 00:16:49,224
AND PADDLED AFTER THE GOAT
IN A..."

365
00:16:49,257 --> 00:16:51,143
HMM.

366
00:16:51,175 --> 00:16:54,532
DO YOU SEE WHAT THE FOX
COULD RIDE IN

367
00:16:54,563 --> 00:16:56,705
THAT RHYMES WITH SHOE?

368
00:16:59,711 --> 00:17:00,797
 BLUE CANOE.

369
00:17:00,829 --> 00:17:02,300
 BLUE CANOE.

370
00:17:02,332 --> 00:17:06,839
RIGHT, BLUE CANOE RHYMES
WITH SHOE.

371
00:17:06,871 --> 00:17:07,862
BRILLIANT.

372
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:10,004
BLUE CANOE,
THAT'S PERFECT!

373
00:17:10,036 --> 00:17:11,826
WE'RE DONE.

374
00:17:11,858 --> 00:17:13,457
LET'S READ OUR POEM
TOGETHER.

375
00:17:13,488 --> 00:17:16,269
"ONCE THERE WAS
A FOX ON A BOX
PLAYING WITH..."

376
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:17,453
 BLOCKS.

377
00:17:17,485 --> 00:17:20,010
"THEN ALONG CAME A GOAT,
RIDING IN A..."

378
00:17:20,042 --> 00:17:21,097
 BOAT!

379
00:17:21,129 --> 00:17:22,088
"DRESSED IN A..."

380
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,399
 COAT!

381
00:17:23,431 --> 00:17:26,819
"AND THE FOX JUMPED
OFF THE BOX,
PUT ON ONE SHOE

382
00:17:26,851 --> 00:17:28,929
AND PADDLED
AFTER THE GOAT IN A..."

383
00:17:28,961 --> 00:17:30,208
BLUE CANOE!

384
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,477
THANKS FOR HELPING ME.

385
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,757
HEY, YOU'RE WELCOME.

386
00:17:33,788 --> 00:17:36,793
BUT, UH...
DID YOU SEE

387
00:17:36,825 --> 00:17:39,415
WHICH WAY
MY PUPPY WENT?

388
00:17:39,447 --> 00:17:41,269
DIDN'T SHE JUMP
IN THAT CANOE?

389
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:44,594
NO, THAT WAS FOX.

390
00:17:51,722 --> 00:17:54,247
OOH! GAD! YOU...

391
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,686

00:17:59,395 --> 00:18:01,600
 NO, A CLUE.

395
00:18:01,632 --> 00:18:04,925
THIS?
OH, THAT'S
NOT BLUE.

396
00:18:04,957 --> 00:18:07,290
THAT'S
JUST A CLUE.

397
00:18:07,323 --> 00:18:09,208
HEY... THIS MOUSE

398
00:18:09,241 --> 00:18:12,598

00:18:14,963 --> 00:18:16,881
A BLUE'S CLUE.

401
00:18:16,913 --> 00:18:19,087
WELL, YOU KNOW
WHAT WE NEED.

00:18:42,712 --> 00:18:44,374
LINES FOR THE WHISKERS...

411
00:18:44,405 --> 00:18:47,826
AND A LONG, SQUIGGLY LINE
FOR THE TAIL. THERE.

412
00:18:47,858 --> 00:18:49,137
A MOUSE.

413
00:18:52,461 --> 00:18:56,457
WELL, WE HAVE
ALL THREE CLUES.

414
00:18:56,489 --> 00:18:57,960

00:18:59,718 --> 00:19:01,125
WE'RE READY FOR OUR...

417
00:19:01,157 --> 00:19:03,267
THINKING CHAIR! COME ON.

ALL RIGHT.

422
00:19:21,136 --> 00:19:26,763
NOW THAT WE'RE IN OUR...
THINKING CHAIR, LET'S THINK.

423
00:19:26,795 --> 00:19:33,029
OKAY, SO, WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT TICKETY'S FAVORITE

424
00:19:33,061 --> 00:19:35,138
AND OUR BLUE'S CLUES ARE

425
00:19:35,171 --> 00:19:39,039
A NUMBER "1"...

426
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:41,820
A CLOCK...

427
00:19:41,852 --> 00:19:45,433

430
00:19:57,069 --> 00:19:58,668
HMM...

431
00:19:58,699 --> 00:20:05,988
OOH, COULD IT BE THE CLOCK
THAT STRUCK 1:00 AND WAS
AFRAID OF A MOUSE?

432
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,098
 NO.

433
00:20:08,129 --> 00:20:09,440
NO.

434
00:20:09,472 --> 00:20:15,322
WELL, WHAT RHYME IS ABOUT
A CLOCK THAT STRIKES 1:00

435
00:20:15,355 --> 00:20:19,606
AND A MOUSE RUNNING
UP AND DOWN, OR...

442
00:20:29,357 --> 00:20:32,074
THE NUMBER "1"
FOR "THE CLOCK STRIKES 1:00."
