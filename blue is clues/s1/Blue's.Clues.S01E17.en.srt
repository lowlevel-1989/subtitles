00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50.633
FIRST WE HAVE A SQUARE...

253
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:52.867
THEN TWO LINES DOWN...

254
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55.033

00:13:14,433 --> 00:13:16.300
A SHEEP SAYS...?

286

"QUACK, QUACK"

295
00:13:42,933 --> 00:13:46.033
AND A SHEEP SAYS,

306
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15.600
WHEN
YOU'RE SAD,
YOU FROWN?

307
00:14:15,633 --> 00:14:20.733
WHEN YOU'RE SAD,
YOU SNORE?

360
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34.700
PLAYING WITH BLOCKS."

361
00:16:34,733 --> 00:16:36.767
HERE'S MY SECOND LINE.

362
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41.400
"ALONG CAME A GOAT,
RIDING IN A...
DRESSED IN A..."

363
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:44.300
I NEED TWO WORDS
THAT RHYME WITH GOAT.

364
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:45.567
HMM.

365
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48.667
DO YOU SEE TWO WORDS
THAT RHYME WITH GOAT?

366
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:52.433
GOAT RIDING IN A...

367
00:16:52,467 --> 00:16:54.533
 BOAT! 

368
00:16:54,567 --> 00:16:57.767
DRESSED IN A...

369
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59.133
 COAT! 

370
00:16:59,167 --> 00:17:00.867
GREAT!

371
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03.000
BOAT AND COAT.

372
00:17:03,033 --> 00:17:05.633
WE FIGURED OUT
THE WHOLE SECOND LINE.

373
00:17:05,667 --> 00:17:09.400
OKAY, SO HOW MUCH OF THE POEM
HAVE WE FINISHED NOW?

374
00:17:11,467 --> 00:17:15.367
"THERE ONCE WAS A FOX ON A BOX
PLAYING WITH BLOCKS.

375
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19.500
THEN ALONG CAME A GOAT, RIDING
IN A BOAT, DRESSED IN A COAT."

376
00:17:19,533 --> 00:17:22.967
WE NEED ONE MORE LINE
TO FINISH THIS POEM.

377
00:17:24,467 --> 00:17:28.300
"SO THE FOX JUMPED OFF THE BOX,
PUT ON ONE SHOE

378
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:31.233
AND PADDLED AFTER THE GOAT
IN A..."

379
00:17:31,267 --> 00:17:33.233
HMM.

380
00:17:33,267 --> 00:17:36.767
DO YOU SEE WHAT THE FOX
COULD RIDE IN

381
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39.033
THAT RHYMES WITH SHOE?

382
00:17:42,167 --> 00:17:43.300
 BLUE CANOE. 

383
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:44.867
 BLUE CANOE. 

384
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:49.600
RIGHT, BLUE CANOE RHYMES
WITH SHOE.

385
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:50.667
BRILLIANT.

386
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52.900
BLUE CANOE,
THAT'S PERFECT!

387
00:17:52,933 --> 00:17:54.800
WE'RE DONE.

388
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:56.500
LET'S READ OUR POEM
TOGETHER.

389
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:59.433
"ONCE THERE WAS
A FOX ON A BOX
PLAYING WITH..."

390
00:17:59,467 --> 00:18:00.667
 BLOCKS. 

391
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03.333
"THEN ALONG CAME A GOAT,
RIDING IN A..."

392
00:18:03,367 --> 00:18:04.467
 BOAT! 

393
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05.500
"DRESSED IN A..."

394
00:18:05,533 --> 00:18:06.867
 COAT! 

395
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:10.433
"AND THE FOX JUMPED
OFF THE BOX,
PUT ON ONE SHOE

396
00:18:10,467 --> 00:18:12.633

397
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:13.967
BLUE CANOE!

398
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16.333
THANKS FOR HELPING ME.

399
00:18:16,367 --> 00:18:17.667
HEY, YOU'RE WELCOME.

400
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20.833
BUT, UH...
DID YOU SEE

401
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:23.567
WHICH WAY
MY PUPPY WENT?

402
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25.500
DIDN'T SHE JUMP
IN THAT CANOE?

403
00:18:25,533 --> 00:18:28.967
NO, THAT WAS FOX.

404
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39.033
OOH! GAD! YOU...

405
00:18:39,067 --> 00:18:40.533

407
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:44.367
BLUE?
YOU SEE BLUE?
WHERE?

408
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46.700
 NO, A CLUE. 

409
00:18:46,733 --> 00:18:50.167
THIS?
OH, THAT'S
NOT BLUE.

410
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52.633
THAT'S
JUST A CLUE.

411
00:18:52,667 --> 00:18:54.633
HEY... THIS MOUSE

412
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:58.167

PAW PRINT ON IT.

413
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00.600
SHE'S A CLUE.

414
00:19:00,633 --> 00:19:02.633
A BLUE'S CLUE.

415
00:19:02,667 --> 00:19:04.933
WELL, YOU KNOW
WHAT WE NEED.

416
00:19:04,967 --> 00:19:06.333
OUR HANDY-DANDY...

417
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08.100

00:19:29,567 --> 00:19:31.300
LINES FOR THE WHISKERS...

425
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:34.900
AND A LONG, SQUIGGLY LINE
FOR THE TAIL. THERE.

426
00:19:34,933 --> 00:19:36.267
A MOUSE.

427
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39.700


428
00:19:39,733 --> 00:19:43.900
WELL, WE HAVE
ALL THREE CLUES.

429
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:45.467
WE HAVE ALL THREE CLUES!

430
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47.267
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?

431
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48.767
WE'RE READY FOR OUR...

432
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51.000
THINKING CHAIR! COME ON.

433
00:19:51,033 --> 00:19:54.200


434
00:19:54,233 --> 00:19:57.700
THERE GOES BLUE,
LET'S GO, TOO.

435
00:19:57,733 --> 00:19:58.867
A RHYME!

436
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:02.433


437
00:20:06,433 --> 00:20:08.133
AH...

438
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:09.600
ALL RIGHT.

439
00:20:09,633 --> 00:20:15.500
NOW THAT WE'RE IN OUR...
THINKING CHAIR, LET'S THINK.

440
00:20:15,533 --> 00:20:22.033
OKAY, SO, WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT TICKETY'S FAVORITE
NURSERY RHYME IS

441
00:20:22,067 --> 00:20:24.233
AND OUR BLUE'S CLUES ARE

442
00:20:24,267 --> 00:20:28.300
A NUMBER "1"...

443
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:31.200
A CLOCK...

444
00:20:31,233 --> 00:20:34.967
AND... A MOUSE.

445
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36.867
HI.

446
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:47.067
OKAY, SO WHAT RHYME IS ABOUT
A MOUSE, A NUMBER "1",
AND A CLOCK?

447
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48.767
HMM...

448
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:56.400
OOH, COULD IT BE THE CLOCK
THAT STRUCK 1:00 AND WAS
AFRAID OF A MOUSE?

449
00:20:56,433 --> 00:20:58.600
 NO. 

450
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:00.000
NO.

451
00:21:00,033 --> 00:21:06.133
WELL, WHAT RHYME IS ABOUT
A CLOCK THAT STRIKES 1:00

452
00:21:06,167 --> 00:21:10.600
AND A MOUSE RUNNING
UP AND DOWN, OR...

453
00:21:10,633 --> 00:21:12.400
IS THERE A RHYME LIKE THAT?

454
00:21:12,433 --> 00:21:14.100
 HICKORY DICKORY DOCK. 

455
00:21:14,133 --> 00:21:15.833

OF COURSE.

458
00:21:18,633 --> 00:21:20.733
A CLOCK FOR A CLOCK
IN THE RHYME.

459
00:21:20,767 --> 00:21:23.600
THE NUMBER "1"
FOR "THE CLOCK STRIKES 1:00."

460
00:21:23,633 --> 00:21:25.933
AND A MOUSE
WHO RUNS UP AND DOWN.

461
00:21:25,967 --> 00:21:27.500
HICKORY DICKORY DOCK.

AND A SHEEP SAYS...

480
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:13.467
