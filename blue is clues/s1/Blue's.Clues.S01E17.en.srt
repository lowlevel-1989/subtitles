TWO BUTTONS...

413
00:20:45,225 --> 00:20:49,707
AND... A SOCK.

414
00:20:49,742 --> 00:20:52,880
HMM! SO, WHAT COULD
BLUE WANT TO MAKE

415
00:20:52,914 --> 00:20:57,051
WITH YARN,
TWO BUTTONS AND A SOCK?

416
00:20:57,087 --> 00:21:00,293
YARN, TWO BUTTONS AND A SOCK.

417
00:21:00,328 --> 00:21:03,327
OOH! COULD SHE WANT
TO USE THE BUTTONS

418
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:07,293

WITH YARN,
TWO BUTTONS AND A SOCK?

422
00:21:16,949 --> 00:21:23,156
WELL, MAYBE THE TWO BUTTONS
COULD BE LIKE... EYES

423
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:29,259
AND THE YARN COULD BE
LIKE HAIR AND COULD...

424
00:21:29,293 --> 00:21:30,880

425
00:21:30,913 --> 00:21:33,225
