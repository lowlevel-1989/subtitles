76
00:03:56,339 --> 00:03:58,609

AHA.

79
00:04:04,047 --> 00:04:06,182
YOU KNOW HOW YOU CAN TELL
IT'S A CLUE?

80
00:04:06,216 --> 00:04:10,954
IT'S GOT BLUE'S PAW PRINTS
ON IT.

81
00:04:10,987 --> 00:04:15,091
IT'S OUR FIRST BLUE'S CLUE.

82
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:17,728

A LINE ON THE BOTTOM,

87
00:04:35,779 --> 00:04:38,582
TWO LINES, AND WE HAVE A CUP.

88
00:04:38,615 --> 00:04:43,954
BUT YOU CAN'T EAT A CUP
FOR SNACK.

89
00:04:43,987 --> 00:04:53,730
HEY, DO YOU THINK BLUE WANTS
TO PUT SOMETHING IN THE CUP?

90
00:04:53,764 --> 00:04:55,165
YEAH!

91
00:04:55,198 --> 00:04:58,569

00:04:58,602 --> 00:05:02,172
SO WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT SHE
WANTS WITH HER SNACK.

HA!

102
00:05:40,811 --> 00:05:41,812

BLUE...
WHAT DID YOU DO?

168
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,282
BLUE KNOCKED OVER
THE GROCERY BAG.

169
00:09:06,316 --> 00:09:07,818
THAT'S WHAT

YEAH...
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA, BLUE.

171
00:09:14,124 --> 00:09:15,959
LET'S CLEAN THIS UP FIRST

172
00:09:15,992 --> 00:09:19,129
AND THEN WE CAN LOOK
FOR MORE BLUE'S CLUES.

173
00:09:19,162 --> 00:09:22,098
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO NEED
YOUR HELP

HMM...

180
00:09:34,845 --> 00:09:36,346
I DON'T SEE A CIRCLE.

181
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:38,549
COULD YOU SHOW ME THE CIRCLE?

182
00:09:39,883 --> 00:09:42,753
 IT'S THE ORANGE!

184
00:09:47,991 --> 00:09:52,428
NOW LET'S PUT AWAY
THE SQUARE, LIKE THIS.

185
00:09:55,532 --> 00:09:58,535
OKAY, A SQUARE.

186
00:09:58,569 --> 00:10:00,336
HMM.

187
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:01,938
I DON'T SEE A SQUARE.

188
00:10:01,972 --> 00:10:04,174
COULD YOU SHOW ME THE SQUARE?

189
00:10:04,207 --> 00:10:07,143
 IT'S RIGHT THERE.

190
00:10:07,177 --> 00:10:09,980
 IT'S THE CHEESE.

191
00:10:12,549 --> 00:10:14,150
Both:
WONDERFUL!

192
00:10:14,184 --> 00:10:17,721
NOW LET'S PUT AWAY
THE RECTANGLE.

193
00:10:17,754 --> 00:10:19,723
Both:
LIKE THIS!

194
00:10:22,693 --> 00:10:27,998
OKAY, RECTANGLE, HMM.

195
00:10:28,031 --> 00:10:30,867
I DON'T SEE A RECTANGLE.

196
00:10:30,901 --> 00:10:34,304
COULD YOU SHOW ME
THE RECTANGLE, TOO?

197
00:10:34,337 --> 00:10:35,338
 THERE IT IS.

198
00:10:35,371 --> 00:10:37,173
 THAT'S THE GRAHAM CRACKERS.

199
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,412
Both:
GREAT!

200
00:10:42,445 --> 00:10:45,549
NOW LET'S PUT AWAY
THE TRIANGLE.

201
00:10:45,582 --> 00:10:46,750
LIKE THIS.

202
00:10:51,522 --> 00:10:54,825
UH, TRIANGLE, HMM.

203
00:10:54,858 --> 00:10:56,793
I DON'T SEE A TRIANGLE.

204
00:10:56,827 --> 00:10:59,530
COULD YOU SHOW ME THE TRIANGLE?

205
00:10:59,563 --> 00:11:03,967
 SEE? THE BUNCH OF GRAPES,
 RIGHT THERE!

206
00:11:06,102 --> 00:11:07,704
HEY, THANKS FOR HELPING.

207
00:11:07,738 --> 00:11:09,439
AND THANK YOU, TOO, BLUE.

208
00:11:10,807 --> 00:11:14,110
WHOA, LOOK IN THE 'FRIDGE.

209
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:31,862
OH, NO, THESE STRAWS
ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE.

210
00:11:31,895 --> 00:11:35,398
MAYBE WE SHOULD...
PUT THEM AWAY.

211
00:11:46,743 --> 00:11:47,944
THERE.

212
00:11:47,978 --> 00:11:50,914
NOW ALL THE STRAWS ARE...
PUT AWAY.

213
00:11:52,115 --> 00:11:54,818
WHAT? DO YOU SEE
ANOTHER STRAW?

214
00:11:54,851 --> 00:11:56,653
 A CLUE, A CLUE!

215
00:11:56,687 --> 00:11:58,254
WHERE?

216
00:12:00,957 --> 00:12:02,659
I DON'T SEE IT.

217
00:12:12,002 --> 00:12:13,804
AHA!

218
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:20,143
WELL, NOW, THAT'S ABOUT THE
SILLIEST STRAW I EVER SAW.

219
00:12:21,678 --> 00:12:23,146
OH... OH!

220
00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:24,648
OH, OH, OH!

221
00:12:24,681 --> 00:12:27,684
THAT STRAW HAS BLUE'S
PAW PRINTS ON IT!

222
00:12:27,718 --> 00:12:29,319
IT MUST BE ONE OF...

223
00:12:29,352 --> 00:12:31,454
BLUE'S CLUES!

224
00:12:31,487 --> 00:12:33,389
YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.

225
00:12:33,423 --> 00:12:35,491
WE NEED OUR HANDY-DANDY...

226
00:12:35,526 --> 00:12:37,327
 NOTEBOOK!

227
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,662
NOTEBOOK.

228
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,468
LET'S SEE.

229
00:12:45,502 --> 00:12:47,738
THERE'S THE TOP...

230
00:12:47,771 --> 00:12:49,139
A COUPLE OF LINES...

231
00:12:49,172 --> 00:12:52,008
THAT LITTLE BENDY PART...

232
00:12:52,042 --> 00:12:57,180
TWO LONG LINES, AND
A STRIPE DOWN THE MIDDLE.

233
00:12:57,213 --> 00:13:00,216
UH... HMM.

234
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:04,588
SO WHAT DOES BLUE WANT
WITH HER SNACK?

235
00:13:04,621 --> 00:13:08,324
BLUE'S FIRST CLUE WAS A... A...

236
00:13:08,358 --> 00:13:09,492
 A CUP!

237
00:13:09,526 --> 00:13:11,227
RIGHT, A CUP.

238
00:13:11,261 --> 00:13:17,133
AND NOW, BLUE'S SECOND CLUE
IS A... STRAW.

239
00:13:17,167 --> 00:13:18,702
HMM.

240
00:13:18,735 --> 00:13:25,475
BLUE WANTS SOMETHING TO...
SOMETHING TO...

241
00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:26,810
 TO DRINK!

242
00:13:26,843 --> 00:13:28,512
DRINK, RIGHT!

243
00:13:28,545 --> 00:13:31,147
WITH A CUP AND A STRAW.

244
00:13:31,181 --> 00:13:34,818
WELL, WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK
IT COULD BE?

245
00:13:34,851 --> 00:13:38,121
YOU THINK WE SHOULD LOOK
FOR OUR LAST BLUE'S CLUE

246
00:13:38,154 --> 00:13:41,658
SO WE CAN FIGURE OUT
WHAT BLUE WANTS WITH HER SNACK?

247
00:13:41,692 --> 00:13:43,860
SO DO I! COME ON!

248
00:13:43,894 --> 00:13:45,996

250
00:13:47,531 --> 00:13:48,832

00:14:01,311 --> 00:14:05,616

I WANT TO WAIL, "MAIL!" *

256
00:14:07,751 --> 00:14:10,253

271
00:14:47,624 --> 00:14:51,895

272
00:14:55,098 --> 00:14:58,034
I LIKE THIS SNACK
'CAUSE I CAN DO IT MYSELF.

273
00:15:04,508 --> 00:15:06,777

00:19:18,428 --> 00:19:23,834
THAT COW HAS BLUE'S PAW PRINTS
ALL OVER IT!

364
00:19:23,867 --> 00:19:27,871
THAT MUST MEAN THAT
THAT COW IS ANOTHER ONE OF...

365
00:19:27,904 --> 00:19:30,440
BLUE'S CLUES!

366
00:19:30,473 --> 00:19:37,614
HEY, DO YOU THINK BLUE WANTS TO
DRINK A COW WITH HER SNACK?

367
00:19:37,648 --> 00:19:39,249
 NO.

368
00:19:39,282 --> 00:19:40,250
NO.

369
00:19:40,283 --> 00:19:41,785
OKAY.

370
00:19:41,818 --> 00:19:45,689
WELL, THIS CALLS
FOR OUR HANDY-DANDY...

371
00:19:45,722 --> 00:19:46,857
 NOTEBOOK.

372
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,358
NOTEBOOK.

373
00:19:55,031 --> 00:20:00,871
OKAY, WE GOT THE COW'S HEAD...

374
00:20:00,904 --> 00:20:04,374
A BIG CIRCLE FOR THE BODY...

375
00:20:04,407 --> 00:20:07,611
LINES FOR HER LEGS AND TAIL..

376
00:20:07,644 --> 00:20:09,846
THE HOOVES...

377
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,015
AND AN UDDER...

378
00:20:12,048 --> 00:20:13,183
AND THERE'S A COW.

379
00:20:13,216 --> 00:20:15,451
GREAT!

380
00:20:15,485 --> 00:20:18,021
HEY, NOW THAT WE HAVE
ALL THREE CLUES

381
00:20:18,054 --> 00:20:20,724
THAT MEANS WE'RE READY
TO GO BACK HOME

382
00:20:20,757 --> 00:20:22,258
TO OUR THINKING CHAIR

383
00:20:22,292 --> 00:20:25,562
AND FIGURE OUT WHAT
BLUE WANTS WITH HER SNACK!

384
00:20:25,596 --> 00:20:27,263
GREAT, LET'S GO!

385
00:20:38,408 --> 00:20:44,515
NOW THAT WE'RE IN OUR
THINKING CHAIR, LET'S THINK.

386
00:20:44,548 --> 00:20:49,820
HMM, SO, WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT BLUE WANTS WITH HER SNACK.

387
00:20:49,853 --> 00:20:54,925
BLUE'S CLUES ARE A CUP...

388
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:57,828
A STRAW...

389
00:20:57,861 --> 00:21:01,364
AND A COW.

390
00:21:01,397 --> 00:21:02,899
HMM.

391
00:21:02,933 --> 00:21:06,670
WHAT DO YOU THINK BLUE
WANTS WITH HER SNACK?

392
00:21:06,703 --> 00:21:08,138
HMM.

393
00:21:08,171 --> 00:21:09,873
OH, OH, OH.

394
00:21:09,906 --> 00:21:14,310
DO YOU THINK BLUE WANTS TO
PUT THE COW IN A CUP

395
00:21:14,344 --> 00:21:16,747
AND SLURP IT UP WITH A STRAW?

396
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,381
 NO.

397
00:21:18,414 --> 00:21:19,716
NO.

398
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:23,186
CAN'T REALLY FIT A COW IN A CUP.

399
00:21:23,219 --> 00:21:24,588
HMM...

400
00:21:24,621 --> 00:21:30,493
WELL, COWS MAKE
THE SOUND "MOO," RIGHT?

401
00:21:30,527 --> 00:21:33,163
COWS MAKE "MOO" SOUNDS.

402
00:21:33,196 --> 00:21:34,531
COWS MAKE M...

403
00:21:34,565 --> 00:21:35,699
 MILK!

404
00:21:35,732 --> 00:21:38,468
MILK! YES!

405
00:21:38,502 --> 00:21:39,970
YES, THAT'S IT.

406
00:21:40,003 --> 00:21:42,639
COWS MAKE THE MILK WE DRINK!

407
00:21:42,673 --> 00:21:46,442
YEAH, THAT'S THE ANSWER
TO BLUE'S CLUES!

408
00:21:46,476 --> 00:21:49,079
BLUE WANTS MILK POURED IN A CUP

409
00:21:49,112 --> 00:21:51,648
AND SHE WANTS TO DRINK IT
WITH A STRAW!

410
00:21:51,682 --> 00:21:56,219

HEY, BLUE?

416
00:22:07,964 --> 00:22:11,968
I'M GOING TO POUR
SOME MILK IN A CUP
WITH A STRAW RIGHT NOW

417
00:22:12,002 --> 00:22:14,605
AND YOU CAN DRINK IT

418
00:22:21,111 --> 00:22:24,080
WE'RE ALL SET
FOR OUR SNACK, BLUE.

419
00:22:24,114 --> 00:22:29,653
WE GOT OUR CUPS OF MILK
WITH STRAWS RIGHT HERE.

420
00:22:29,686 --> 00:22:32,388
OH... OKAY...

421
00:22:37,427 --> 00:22:38,595

OH, LOOK.

00:22:55,078 --> 00:22:58,114
MR. SALT AND MRS. PEPPER.

428
00:22:58,148 --> 00:23:01,552
RIGHT, THEY BROUGHT THE FOOD
WE HELPED TO PUT AWAY.

429
00:23:02,753 --> 00:23:05,556
LOOK...
IT'S THE CHICKS.

430
00:23:05,589 --> 00:23:08,559
