YOU KNOW HOW YOU CAN TELL
IT'S A CLUE?

00:04:08,967 --> 00:04:13.700
IT'S GOT BLUE'S PAW PRINTS

92
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:17.833
IT'S OUR FIRST BLUE'S CLUE.

00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41.300
TWO LINES, AND WE HAVE A CUP.

99
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:46.667
BUT YOU CAN'T EAT A CUP
FOR SNACK.

100
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:56.433
HEY, DO YOU THINK BLUE WANTS
TO PUT SOMETHING IN THE CUP?

ALL RIGHT, WELL, WE BETTER
GET TO THE KITCHEN, AND FAST.

193
00:08:41,033 --> 00:08:44.767
WAIT TILL YOU MEET MY FRIENDS,
MR. SALT AND MRS. PEPPER.

194
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46.567
YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE THEM.

195
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48.500
* WE ARE GOING TO THE KITCHEN

196
00:08:48,533 --> 00:08:51.000
* TO MEET
MY KITCHEN FRIENDS, YEAH. *

197
00:08:51,033 --> 00:08:55.000


198
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:56.933
HI, MR. SALT
AND MRS. PEPPER.

199
00:08:56,967 --> 00:08:57.933
HELLO, STEVE.

200
00:08:57,967 --> 00:08:59.100
HELLO, STEVE.

201
00:08:59,133 --> 00:09:02.133
OH, OOH, HEY.

202
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:06.100
BLUE...
WHAT DID YOU DO?

203
00:09:06,133 --> 00:09:08.733
BLUE KNOCKED OVER
THE GROCERY BAG.

204
00:09:08,767 --> 00:09:10.267
THAT'S WHAT
SHE DID.

205
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11.433


206
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:12.800


207
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14.133


208
00:09:14,167 --> 00:09:16.533
YEAH...
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA, BLUE.

209
00:09:16,567 --> 00:09:18.400
LET'S CLEAN THIS UP FIRST

210
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:21.567
AND THEN WE CAN LOOK
FOR MORE BLUE'S CLUES.

211
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24.533
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO NEED
YOUR HELP

212
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:26.000
PUTTING ALL THIS FOOD AWAY.

213
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:27.900
Both:
OKAY.

214
00:09:27,933 --> 00:09:30.433
LET'S START WITH
THE GREAT BIG CIRCLE.

215
00:09:30,467 --> 00:09:31.633
Both:
LIKE THIS.

216
00:09:33,933 --> 00:09:36.067
OKAY, CIRCLE.

217
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37.233
HMM...

218
00:09:37,267 --> 00:09:38.767
I DON'T SEE A CIRCLE.

219
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40.967
COULD YOU SHOW ME THE CIRCLE?

220
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45.167
 IT'S THE ORANGE!

221
00:09:46,767 --> 00:09:49.167


222
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50.367
Both:
GREAT!

223
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54.833
NOW LET'S PUT AWAY
THE SQUARE, LIKE THIS.

224
00:09:57,933 --> 00:10:00.933
OKAY, A SQUARE.

225
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:02.733
HMM.

226
00:10:02,767 --> 00:10:04.333
I DON'T SEE A SQUARE.

227
00:10:04,367 --> 00:10:06.567
COULD YOU SHOW ME THE SQUARE?

228
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09.533
 IT'S RIGHT THERE.

229
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12.367
 IT'S THE CHEESE.

230
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14.900


231
00:10:14,933 --> 00:10:16.533
Both:
WONDERFUL!

232
00:10:16,567 --> 00:10:20.100
NOW LET'S PUT AWAY
THE RECTANGLE.

233
00:10:20,133 --> 00:10:22.100
Both:
LIKE THIS!

234
00:10:25,067 --> 00:10:30.367
OKAY, RECTANGLE, HMM.

235
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33.233
I DON'T SEE A RECTANGLE.

236
00:10:33,267 --> 00:10:36.667
COULD YOU SHOW ME
THE RECTANGLE, TOO?

237
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37.700
 THERE IT IS.

238
00:10:37,733 --> 00:10:39.533
 THAT'S THE GRAHAM CRACKERS.

239
00:10:39,567 --> 00:10:40.700


240
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:42.633


241
00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:44.767
Both:
GREAT!

242
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47.900
NOW LET'S PUT AWAY
THE TRIANGLE.

243
00:10:47,933 --> 00:10:49.100
LIKE THIS.

244
00:10:53,867 --> 00:10:57.167
UH, TRIANGLE, HMM.

245
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59.133
I DON'T SEE A TRIANGLE.

246
00:10:59,167 --> 00:11:01.867
COULD YOU SHOW ME THE TRIANGLE?

247
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:06.300
 SEE? THE BUNCH OF GRAPES,
 RIGHT THERE!

248
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08.400


249
00:11:08,433 --> 00:11:10.033
HEY, THANKS FOR HELPING.

250
00:11:10,067 --> 00:11:11.767
AND THANK YOU, TOO, BLUE.

251
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13.100


252
00:11:13,133 --> 00:11:16.433
WHOA, LOOK IN THE 'FRIDGE.

253
00:11:22,667 --> 00:11:24.633


254
00:11:25,633 --> 00:11:27.500


255
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:34.167
OH, NO, THESE STRAWS
ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE.

256
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37.700
MAYBE WE SHOULD...
PUT THEM AWAY.

257
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42.767


258
00:11:49,033 --> 00:11:50.233
THERE.

259
00:11:50,267 --> 00:11:53.200
NOW ALL THE STRAWS ARE...
PUT AWAY.

260
00:11:53,233 --> 00:11:54.367


261
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57.100
WHAT? DO YOU SEE
ANOTHER STRAW?

262
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58.933
 A CLUE, A CLUE!

263
00:11:58,967 --> 00:12:00.533
WHERE?

264
00:12:03,233 --> 00:12:04.933
I DON'T SEE IT.

265
00:12:04,967 --> 00:12:06.967


266
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:16.067
AHA!

267
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18.367


268
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22.400
WELL, NOW, THAT'S ABOUT THE
SILLIEST STRAW I EVER SAW.

269
00:12:23,933 --> 00:12:25.400
OH... OH!

270
00:12:25,433 --> 00:12:26.900
OH, OH, OH!

271
00:12:26,933 --> 00:12:29.933
THAT STRAW HAS BLUE'S
PAW PRINTS ON IT!

272
00:12:29,967 --> 00:12:31.567
IT MUST BE ONE OF...

273
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33.700
BLUE'S CLUES!

274
00:12:33,733 --> 00:12:35.633
YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.

275
00:12:35,667 --> 00:12:37.733
WE NEED OUR HANDY-DANDY...

276
00:12:37,767 --> 00:12:39.567
 NOTEBOOK!

277
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40.900
NOTEBOOK.

278
00:12:40,933 --> 00:12:43.100


279
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:47.700
LET'S SEE.

280
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:49.967
THERE'S THE TOP...

281
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51.367
A COUPLE OF LINES...

282
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54.233
THAT LITTLE BENDY PART...

283
00:12:54,267 --> 00:12:59.400
TWO LONG LINES, AND
A STRIPE DOWN THE MIDDLE.

284
00:12:59,433 --> 00:13:02.433
UH... HMM.

285
00:13:02,467 --> 00:13:06.800
SO WHAT DOES BLUE WANT
WITH HER SNACK?

286
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:10.533
BLUE'S FIRST CLUE WAS A... A...

287
00:13:10,567 --> 00:13:11.700
 A CUP!

288
00:13:11,733 --> 00:13:13.433
RIGHT, A CUP.

289
00:13:13,467 --> 00:13:19.333
AND NOW, BLUE'S SECOND CLUE
IS A... STRAW.

290
00:13:19,367 --> 00:13:20.900
HMM.

291
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:27.667
BLUE WANTS SOMETHING TO...
SOMETHING TO...

292
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29.000
 TO DRINK!

293
00:13:29,033 --> 00:13:30.700
DRINK, RIGHT!

294
00:13:30,733 --> 00:13:33.333
WITH A CUP AND A STRAW.

295
00:13:33,367 --> 00:13:37.000
WELL, WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK
IT COULD BE?

296
00:13:37,033 --> 00:13:40.300
YOU THINK WE SHOULD LOOK
FOR OUR LAST BLUE'S CLUE

297
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:43.833
SO WE CAN FIGURE OUT
WHAT BLUE WANTS WITH HER SNACK?

298
00:13:43,867 --> 00:13:46.033
SO DO I! COME ON!

299
00:13:46,067 --> 00:13:48.167

301
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51.000

00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:07.767
* WHEN IT COMES,
I WANT TO WAIL, "MAIL!" *

307
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09.867

00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:48.400
Boy:
WE'RE PUTTING
PEANUT BUTTER
ON THE APPLES.

324
00:14:49,733 --> 00:14:54.000
IT TASTES LIKE, UM...
APPLE JUICE.

325
00:14:54,033 --> 00:14:57.167


326
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00.133
I LIKE THIS SNACK
'CAUSE I CAN DO IT MYSELF.

327
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08.867
All:

328

00:18:57,267 --> 00:18:58.433


417
00:18:58,467 --> 00:19:00.800
BLUE, BLUE!

418
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:02.733

421
00:19:06,533 --> 00:19:10.533
OH. DID YOU SEE A CLUE?

422
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:11.767

425
00:19:17,767 --> 00:19:20.233
OH.... OH...

426
00:19:20,267 --> 00:19:25.667
THAT COW HAS BLUE'S PAW PRINTS
ALL OVER IT!

427
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:29.700
THAT MUST MEAN THAT
THAT COW IS ANOTHER ONE OF...

428
00:19:29,733 --> 00:19:32.267
BLUE'S CLUES!

429
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:39.433
HEY, DO YOU THINK BLUE WANTS TO
DRINK A COW WITH HER SNACK?

430
00:19:39,467 --> 00:19:41.067
 NO.

431
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42.067
NO.

432
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43.600
OKAY.

NOTEBOOK.

436
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:56.800


437
00:19:56,833 --> 00:20:02.667
OKAY, WE GOT THE COW'S HEAD...

438
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:06.167
A BIG CIRCLE FOR THE BODY...

439
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09.400
LINES FOR HER LEGS AND TAIL..

440
00:20:09,433 --> 00:20:11.633
THE HOOVES...

441
00:20:11,667 --> 00:20:13.800
AND AN UDDER...

442
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:14.967
AND THERE'S A COW.

443
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17.233
GREAT!

444
00:20:17,267 --> 00:20:19.800
HEY, NOW THAT WE HAVE
ALL THREE CLUES

445
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:22.500
THAT MEANS WE'RE READY
TO GO BACK HOME

446
00:20:22,533 --> 00:20:24.033
TO OUR THINKING CHAIR

447
00:20:24,067 --> 00:20:27.333
AND FIGURE OUT WHAT
BLUE WANTS WITH HER SNACK!

448
00:20:27,367 --> 00:20:29.033
GREAT, LET'S GO!

449
00:20:29,067 --> 00:20:31.833


450
00:20:33,767 --> 00:20:35.933


451
00:20:40,167 --> 00:20:46.267
NOW THAT WE'RE IN OUR
THINKING CHAIR, LET'S THINK.

452
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:51.567
HMM, SO, WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT BLUE WANTS WITH HER SNACK.

453
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56.667
BLUE'S CLUES ARE A CUP...

454
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59.567
A STRAW...

455
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03.100
AND A COW.

456
00:21:03,133 --> 00:21:04.633
HMM.

457
00:21:04,667 --> 00:21:08.400
WHAT DO YOU THINK BLUE
WANTS WITH HER SNACK?

458
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09.867
HMM.

459
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11.600
OH, OH, OH.

460
00:21:11,633 --> 00:21:16.033
DO YOU THINK BLUE WANTS TO
PUT THE COW IN A CUP

461
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:18.467
AND SLURP IT UP WITH A STRAW?

462
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20.100
 NO.

463
00:21:20,133 --> 00:21:21.433
NO.

464
00:21:21,467 --> 00:21:24.900
CAN'T REALLY FIT A COW IN A CUP.

465
00:21:24,933 --> 00:21:26.300
HMM...

466
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:32.200
WELL, COWS MAKE
THE SOUND "MOO," RIGHT?

467
00:21:32,233 --> 00:21:34.867
COWS MAKE "MOO" SOUNDS.

468
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36.233
COWS MAKE M...

469
00:21:36,267 --> 00:21:37.400
 MILK!

470
00:21:37,433 --> 00:21:40.167
MILK! YES!

471
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41.667
YES, THAT'S IT.

472
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44.333
COWS MAKE THE MILK WE DRINK!

473
00:21:44,367 --> 00:21:48.133
YEAH, THAT'S THE ANSWER
TO BLUE'S CLUES!

474
00:21:48,167 --> 00:21:50.767
BLUE WANTS MILK POURED IN A CUP

475
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53.333
AND SHE WANTS TO DRINK IT
WITH A STRAW!

476
00:21:53,367 --> 00:21:57.900

HEY, BLUE?

482
00:22:09,633 --> 00:22:13.633
I'M GOING TO POUR
SOME MILK IN A CUP
WITH A STRAW RIGHT NOW

483
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:16.267
AND YOU CAN DRINK IT
WITH YOUR SNACK!

484
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22.733


485
00:22:22,767 --> 00:22:25.733
WE'RE ALL SET
FOR OUR SNACK, BLUE.

486
00:22:25,767 --> 00:22:31.300

WITH STRAWS RIGHT HERE.

487
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:34.033
OH... OKAY...

RIGHT.

494
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54.267
REMEMBER HOW WE HELPED THEM

495
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56.667
