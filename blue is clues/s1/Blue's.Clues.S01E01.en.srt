00:07:58,148 --> 00:07:59,816
BLUE, WHERE ARE...

174
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:04,287


175
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,558
IT'S THE PHONE.

176
00:08:07,591 --> 00:08:08,892
HELLO?

177
00:08:08,925 --> 00:08:09,893
Hello.

178
00:08:09,926 --> 00:08:10,894
Hello.

179
00:08:10,927 --> 00:08:12,062
This is Mr. Salt...

180
00:08:12,095 --> 00:08:13,496
and Mrs. Pepper.

181
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:16,567
IT'S MY GOOD FRIENDS,
MR. SALT AND MRS. PEPPER.

182
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,735
HELLO, MR. SALT AND MRS. PEPPER.

183
00:08:18,769 --> 00:08:19,903
HOW ARE YOU?

184
00:08:19,936 --> 00:08:21,104
Fine.

185
00:08:21,137 --> 00:08:23,406
Fine. But Blue
is in the kitchen...

186
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:25,776
and she's making
a really big mess.

187
00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:26,943
UH-OH. ALL RIGHT.

188
00:08:26,977 --> 00:08:29,112
STAY PUT, WE'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

189
00:08:29,145 --> 00:08:32,683
YOU WILL COME AND HELP ME
WITH THIS, WON'T YOU?

190
00:08:32,716 --> 00:08:34,284
YOU WILL? COOL.

191
00:08:34,317 --> 00:08:38,522
ALL RIGHT, WELL, WE BETTER
GET TO THE KITCHEN, AND FAST.

192
00:08:38,555 --> 00:08:42,292
WAIT TILL YOU MEET MY FRIENDS,
MR. SALT AND MRS. PEPPER.

193
00:08:42,325 --> 00:08:44,094
YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE THEM.

194
00:08:44,127 --> 00:08:46,029
* WE ARE GOING TO THE KITCHEN

195
00:08:46,062 --> 00:08:48,532
* TO MEET
MY KITCHEN FRIENDS, YEAH. *

196
00:08:48,565 --> 00:08:52,536


197
00:08:52,569 --> 00:08:54,470
HI, MR. SALT
AND MRS. PEPPER.

198
00:08:54,505 --> 00:08:55,471
HELLO, STEVE.

199
00:08:55,506 --> 00:08:56,640
HELLO, STEVE.

200
00:08:56,673 --> 00:08:59,676
OH, OOH, HEY.

201
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:03,647
BLUE...
WHAT DID YOU DO?

202
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,282
BLUE KNOCKED OVER
THE GROCERY BAG.

203
00:09:06,316 --> 00:09:07,818
THAT'S WHAT
SHE DID.

204
00:09:07,851 --> 00:09:08,985


205
00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:10,353


206
00:09:10,386 --> 00:09:11,688


207
00:09:11,722 --> 00:09:14,090
YEAH...
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA, BLUE.

208
00:09:14,124 --> 00:09:15,959
LET'S CLEAN THIS UP FIRST

209
00:09:15,992 --> 00:09:19,129
AND THEN WE CAN LOOK
FOR MORE BLUE'S CLUES.

210
00:09:19,162 --> 00:09:22,098
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO NEED
YOUR HELP

211
00:09:22,132 --> 00:09:23,567
PUTTING ALL THIS FOOD AWAY.

212
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,468
Both:
OKAY.

213
00:09:25,502 --> 00:09:28,004
LET'S START WITH
THE GREAT BIG CIRCLE.

214
00:09:28,038 --> 00:09:29,205
Both:
LIKE THIS.

215
00:09:31,508 --> 00:09:33,644
OKAY, CIRCLE.

216
00:09:33,677 --> 00:09:34,811
HMM...

217
00:09:34,845 --> 00:09:36,346
I DON'T SEE A CIRCLE.

218
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:38,549
COULD YOU SHOW ME THE CIRCLE?

219
00:09:39,883 --> 00:09:42,753
 IT'S THE ORANGE!

220
00:09:44,354 --> 00:09:46,757


221
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:47,958
Both:
GREAT!

222
00:09:47,991 --> 00:09:52,428
NOW LET'S PUT AWAY
THE SQUARE, LIKE THIS.

223
00:09:55,532 --> 00:09:58,535
OKAY, A SQUARE.

224
00:09:58,569 --> 00:10:00,336
HMM.

225
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:01,938
I DON'T SEE A SQUARE.

226
00:10:01,972 --> 00:10:04,174
COULD YOU SHOW ME THE SQUARE?

227
00:10:04,207 --> 00:10:07,143
 IT'S RIGHT THERE.

228
00:10:07,177 --> 00:10:09,980
 IT'S THE CHEESE.

229
00:10:10,013 --> 00:10:12,516


230
00:10:12,549 --> 00:10:14,150
Both:
WONDERFUL!

231
00:10:14,184 --> 00:10:17,721
NOW LET'S PUT AWAY
THE RECTANGLE.

232
00:10:17,754 --> 00:10:19,723
Both:
LIKE THIS!

233
00:10:22,693 --> 00:10:27,998
OKAY, RECTANGLE, HMM.

234
00:10:28,031 --> 00:10:30,867
I DON'T SEE A RECTANGLE.

235
00:10:30,901 --> 00:10:34,304
COULD YOU SHOW ME
THE RECTANGLE, TOO?

236
00:10:34,337 --> 00:10:35,338
 THERE IT IS.

237
00:10:35,371 --> 00:10:37,173
 THAT'S THE GRAHAM CRACKERS.

238
00:10:37,207 --> 00:10:38,341


239
00:10:38,374 --> 00:10:40,276


240
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,412
Both:
GREAT!

241
00:10:42,445 --> 00:10:45,549
NOW LET'S PUT AWAY
THE TRIANGLE.

242
00:10:45,582 --> 00:10:46,750
LIKE THIS.

243
00:10:51,522 --> 00:10:54,825
UH, TRIANGLE, HMM.

244
00:10:54,858 --> 00:10:56,793
I DON'T SEE A TRIANGLE.

245
00:10:56,827 --> 00:10:59,530
COULD YOU SHOW ME THE TRIANGLE?

246
00:10:59,563 --> 00:11:03,967
 SEE? THE BUNCH OF GRAPES,
 RIGHT THERE!

247
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,069


248
00:11:06,102 --> 00:11:07,704
HEY, THANKS FOR HELPING.

249
00:11:07,738 --> 00:11:09,439
AND THANK YOU, TOO, BLUE.

250
00:11:09,472 --> 00:11:10,774


251
00:11:10,807 --> 00:11:14,110
WHOA, LOOK IN THE 'FRIDGE.

252
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:22,318


253
00:11:23,319 --> 00:11:25,188


254
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:31,862
OH, NO, THESE STRAWS
ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE.

255
00:11:31,895 --> 00:11:35,398
MAYBE WE SHOULD...
PUT THEM AWAY.

256
00:11:37,801 --> 00:11:40,470


257
00:11:46,743 --> 00:11:47,944
THERE.

258
00:11:47,978 --> 00:11:50,914
NOW ALL THE STRAWS ARE...
PUT AWAY.

259
00:11:50,947 --> 00:11:52,082


260
00:11:52,115 --> 00:11:54,818
WHAT? DO YOU SEE
ANOTHER STRAW?

261
00:11:54,851 --> 00:11:56,653
 A CLUE, A CLUE!

262
00:11:56,687 --> 00:11:58,254
WHERE?

263
00:12:00,957 --> 00:12:02,659
I DON'T SEE IT.

264
00:12:02,693 --> 00:12:04,695


265
00:12:12,002 --> 00:12:13,804
AHA!

266
00:12:13,837 --> 00:12:16,106


267
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:20,143
WELL, NOW, THAT'S ABOUT THE
SILLIEST STRAW I EVER SAW.

268
00:12:21,678 --> 00:12:23,146
OH... OH!

269
00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:24,648
OH, OH, OH!

270
00:12:24,681 --> 00:12:27,684
THAT STRAW HAS BLUE'S
PAW PRINTS ON IT!

271
00:12:27,718 --> 00:12:29,319
IT MUST BE ONE OF...

272
00:12:29,352 --> 00:12:31,454
BLUE'S CLUES!

273
00:12:31,487 --> 00:12:33,389
YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.

274
00:12:33,423 --> 00:12:35,491
WE NEED OUR HANDY-DANDY...

275
00:12:35,526 --> 00:12:37,327
 NOTEBOOK!

276
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,662
NOTEBOOK.

277
00:12:38,695 --> 00:12:40,864


278
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,468
LET'S SEE.

279
00:12:45,502 --> 00:12:47,738
THERE'S THE TOP...

280
00:12:47,771 --> 00:12:49,139
A COUPLE OF LINES...

281
00:12:49,172 --> 00:12:52,008
THAT LITTLE BENDY PART...

282
00:12:52,042 --> 00:12:57,180
TWO LONG LINES, AND
A STRIPE DOWN THE MIDDLE.

283
00:12:57,213 --> 00:13:00,216
UH... HMM.

284
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:04,588
SO WHAT DOES BLUE WANT
WITH HER SNACK?

285
00:13:04,621 --> 00:13:08,324
BLUE'S FIRST CLUE WAS A... A...

286
00:13:08,358 --> 00:13:09,492
 A CUP!

287
00:13:09,526 --> 00:13:11,227
RIGHT, A CUP.

288
00:13:11,261 --> 00:13:17,133
AND NOW, BLUE'S SECOND CLUE
IS A... STRAW.

289
00:13:17,167 --> 00:13:18,702
HMM.

290
00:13:18,735 --> 00:13:25,475
BLUE WANTS SOMETHING TO...
SOMETHING TO...

291
00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:26,810
 TO DRINK!

292
00:13:26,843 --> 00:13:28,512
DRINK, RIGHT!

293
00:13:28,545 --> 00:13:31,147
WITH A CUP AND A STRAW.

294
00:13:31,181 --> 00:13:34,818
WELL, WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK
IT COULD BE?

295
00:13:34,851 --> 00:13:38,121
YOU THINK WE SHOULD LOOK
FOR OUR LAST BLUE'S CLUE

296
00:13:38,154 --> 00:13:41,658
SO WE CAN FIGURE OUT
WHAT BLUE WANTS WITH HER SNACK?

297
00:13:41,692 --> 00:13:43,860
SO DO I! COME ON!

298
00:13:43,894 --> 00:13:45,996

00:13:46,029 --> 00:13:47,497
BLUE!

300
00:13:47,531 --> 00:13:48,832

305
00:14:01,311 --> 00:14:05,616

306
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:07,718

321
00:14:40,651 --> 00:14:43,319


322

Boy:
WE'RE PUTTING
PEANUT BUTTER
ON THE APPLES.

323
00:14:47,624 --> 00:14:51,895
IT TASTES LIKE, UM...
APPLE JUICE.

324
00:14:51,928 --> 00:14:55,065


325
00:14:55,098 --> 00:14:58,034
I LIKE THIS SNACK

326

00:15:21,592 --> 00:15:25,596
BLUE JUST WENT RIGHT INTO
THE PICTURE OF THAT FARM.

332
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:27,998
THAT'S SO COOL.

333
00:15:30,366 --> 00:15:33,336
HEY, I THINK BLUE WANTS US
TO FOLLOW HER.

334
00:15:33,369 --> 00:15:36,372

443
00:20:15,485 --> 00:20:18,021
HEY, NOW THAT WE HAVE
ALL THREE CLUES

444
00:20:18,054 --> 00:20:20,724

445
00:20:20,757 --> 00:20:22,258

446
00:20:22,292 --> 00:20:25,562
AND FIGURE OUT WHAT
BLUE WANTS WITH HER SNACK!

447
00:20:25,596 --> 00:20:27,263
GREAT, LET'S GO!

448
00:20:27,297 --> 00:20:30,066


449
00:20:32,002 --> 00:20:34,170


450
00:20:38,408 --> 00:20:44,515
NOW THAT WE'RE IN OUR
THINKING CHAIR, LET'S THINK.

451
00:20:44,548 --> 00:20:49,820
HMM, SO, WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT BLUE WANTS WITH HER SNACK.

452
00:20:49,853 --> 00:20:54,925
BLUE'S CLUES ARE A CUP...

453
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:57,828
A STRAW...

454
00:20:57,861 --> 00:21:01,364
AND A COW.

455
00:21:01,397 --> 00:21:02,899
HMM.

456
00:21:02,933 --> 00:21:06,670
WHAT DO YOU THINK BLUE

457
00:21:06,703 --> 00:21:08,138
HMM.

458
00:21:08,171 --> 00:21:09,873
OH, OH, OH.

459
00:21:09,906 --> 00:21:14,310
DO YOU THINK BLUE WANTS TO
PUT THE COW IN A CUP

460
00:21:14,344 --> 00:21:16,747
AND SLURP IT UP WITH A STRAW?

461
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,381

462
00:21:18,414 --> 00:21:19,716
NO.

463
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:23,186
CAN'T REALLY FIT A COW IN A CUP.

464
00:21:23,219 --> 00:21:24,588
HMM...

465
00:21:24,621 --> 00:21:30,493
WELL, COWS MAKE
THE SOUND "MOO," RIGHT?

466
00:21:30,527 --> 00:21:33,163
COWS MAKE "MOO" SOUNDS.

COWS MAKE THE MILK WE DRINK!

472
00:21:42,673 --> 00:21:46,442
YEAH, THAT'S THE ANSWER
TO BLUE'S CLUES!

473
00:21:46,476 --> 00:21:49,079
BLUE WANTS MILK POURED IN A CUP

474

AND SHE WANTS TO DRINK IT
WITH A STRAW!

00:22:06,296 --> 00:22:07,931
HEY, BLUE?

481
00:22:07,964 --> 00:22:11,968
I'M GOING TO POUR
SOME MILK IN A CUP
WITH A STRAW RIGHT NOW

482

00:22:47,771 --> 00:22:49,339
RIGHT.

493
00:22:49,372 --> 00:22:52,643
