100
00:04:43,377 --> 00:04:45,461
WE HAVE OUR FIRST CLUE.

102
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,978
 HELMET.

103
00:04:48,011 --> 00:04:49,402

OUR FIRST CLUE IS A HELMET.

117
00:05:22,869 --> 00:05:27,735
WHAT COULD BLUE PRETEND TO BE
WITH A HELMET?

118
00:05:27,768 --> 00:05:29,257
OH.

119
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:32,866

122
00:05:37,996 --> 00:05:39,916
THERE'S A STAR.

123
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:40,910
WHERE?

124
00:05:43,162 --> 00:05:44,618

135
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:07,658

THIS ONE.

157
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:59,298
I DON'T SEE A FISH, DO YOU?

158
00:07:00,392 --> 00:07:01,418
 RIGHT THERE.

159
00:07:02,709 --> 00:07:04,563
HEY.

185
00:08:02,229 --> 00:08:03,653
THIS COULD BE
THE BABY.

186
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:05,538
OR THIS COULD
BE THE BABY.

187
00:08:05,573 --> 00:08:07,029
WHAT ARE YOU
TWO DOING?

188
00:08:07,062 --> 00:08:09,214
Both:
WE'RE PLAYING HOUSE.

189
00:08:09,246 --> 00:08:10,339
I'M THE MOTHER.

190
00:08:10,372 --> 00:08:11,333
I'M THE FATHER.

191
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:14,377
BLUE, DO YOU WANT
TO BE THE BABY?

192
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:16,463
STEVE?

193
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:17,423
WHAT CAN I BE?

194
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:19,906
YOU CAN BE...
THE HELPER.

195
00:08:22,057 --> 00:08:23,845
THE HELPER.

196
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,806
WOW.

197
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:26,825
WILL YOU BE
A HELPER, TOO?

198
00:08:26,858 --> 00:08:28,282
YOU WILL?

199
00:08:28,314 --> 00:08:31,293
GREAT. THEN WE CAN LOOK
FOR MORE BLUE'S CLUES.

200
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:34,670
NOW WE CAN
PLAY HOUSE.

201
00:08:34,703 --> 00:08:36,623
WHERE'S
OUR HOUSE?

202
00:08:36,657 --> 00:08:39,537
HOW CAN WE PLAY HOUSE
WITHOUT A HOUSE?

203
00:08:39,569 --> 00:08:40,895
OH, OH, OH.

204
00:08:40,926 --> 00:08:43,574

A JOB FOR...

205
00:08:43,608 --> 00:08:47,481
THE HELPERS.

206
00:08:47,514 --> 00:08:48,970
WE CAN HELP.

207
00:08:54,202 --> 00:08:56,486

IT'S A HOUSE!

214

00:09:54,748 --> 00:09:57,527
AND THOSE LITTLE BLOCKS
CAN BE THE MEATBALLS.
