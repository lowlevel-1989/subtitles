98
00:04:48,361 --> 00:04:51,498
BECAUSE BLUE'S PAW PRINT

99
00:04:51,534 --> 00:04:53,705
WE HAVE OUR FIRST CLUE.

100
00:04:53,741 --> 00:04:54,982
AND IT'S A...

101
00:04:55,017 --> 00:04:56,327
 HELMET.

102
00:04:56,361 --> 00:04:57,810
HELMET. RIGHT.

103
00:04:57,844 --> 00:05:00,016

SO, WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

114
00:05:25,774 --> 00:05:29,465
WHAT BLUE WANTS
TO PRETEND TO BE.

115
00:05:29,499 --> 00:05:32,636
OUR FIRST CLUE IS A HELMET.

116
00:05:32,672 --> 00:05:37,741
WHAT COULD BLUE PRETEND TO BE
WITH A HELMET?

117
00:05:37,775 --> 00:05:39,326
OH.

118
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,085

120
00:05:44,671 --> 00:05:45,879
LET'S GO.

121
00:05:48,429 --> 00:05:50,429
THERE'S A STAR.

122
00:05:50,465 --> 00:05:51,465
WHERE?

123
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,327
 
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

124
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,119

OH.

128
00:06:03,809 --> 00:06:04,844
HI, BIRDS.

129
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:07,224
HI, BLUE.

130
00:06:07,257 --> 00:06:13,155
SO, UH, YOU SAY YOU CAN SEE
A STAR IN THE DAY TIME.

131
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:14,775
NO.

132
00:06:14,809 --> 00:06:17,224
A CLOUD THAT LOOKS

133
00:06:17,258 --> 00:06:18,327
DO YOU SEE IT?

134
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,327
OH.

135
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,327
WELL, UH... HMM.

136
00:06:22,361 --> 00:06:25,189
UH... NO.

137
00:06:25,224 --> 00:06:28,603
YOU WANT TO FIND THE CLOUD
THAT LOOKS LIKE A STAR?

138
00:06:29,912 --> 00:06:33,085
OKAY, THEN WE'LL GO LOOK

00:06:36,465 --> 00:06:39,844
DO YOU SEE THE CLOUD
THAT LOOKS LIKE A STAR?

141
00:06:42,638 --> 00:06:44,018

142
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,810
OH.

A FISH?

151
00:07:03,396 --> 00:07:04,672
I DON'T SEE
A FISH.

152
00:07:04,705 --> 00:07:05,878
WHERE?

153
00:07:05,914 --> 00:07:07,327
A FISH?

154
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,465
OKAY.

155
00:07:08,499 --> 00:07:10,326
SEE IF WE CAN FIND
THIS ONE.

156
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,119
I DON'T SEE A FISH, DO YOU?

157
00:07:14,258 --> 00:07:15,327
 RIGHT THERE.

158
00:07:16,672 --> 00:07:18,603
HEY.

159
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:21,499

164
00:07:29,742 --> 00:07:30,810
 
I SEE A TREE.

165
00:07:30,844 --> 00:07:31,809
OH, YEAH.

166
00:07:31,844 --> 00:07:32,981
YEAH, RIGHT.

167
00:07:33,018 --> 00:07:34,018
A TREE.

168
00:07:35,465 --> 00:07:37,464
DO YOU SEE A TREE?

169
00:07:39,121 --> 00:07:40,567
 THAT ONE.  
THAT ONE.

170
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:44,223
A TREE.

171
00:07:44,258 --> 00:07:45,638
I SEE IT NOW.

172
00:07:45,672 --> 00:07:48,257
THAT CLOUD LOOKS LIKE
AN ELEPHANT, TOO.

173
00:07:49,913 --> 00:07:50,879
SEE?

174
00:07:50,912 --> 00:07:52,257
YEAH.

BYE, STEVE.

179
00:08:01,361 --> 00:08:02,360
BYE.

180
00:08:07,844 --> 00:08:10,948
BLUE HAS FOUND SHOVEL
AND PAIL, OVER.

181
00:08:15,602 --> 00:08:16,568
HI, SHOVEL.

182
00:08:16,602 --> 00:08:17,568

Both:
HI.

184
00:08:18,672 --> 00:08:20,155
THIS COULD BE

WHAT ARE YOU
TWO DOING?

187
00:08:23,706 --> 00:08:25,948
Both:
WE'RE PLAYING HOUSE.

188
00:08:25,981 --> 00:08:27,120
I'M THE MOTHER.

189
00:08:27,154 --> 00:08:28,155
I'M THE FATHER.

190
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:31,326
BLUE, DO YOU WANT
TO BE THE BABY?

191
00:08:32,534 --> 00:08:33,499
STEVE?

192
00:08:33,534 --> 00:08:34,499
WHAT CAN I BE?

193
00:08:34,533 --> 00:08:37,085
YOU CAN BE...
THE HELPER.

194
00:08:39,326 --> 00:08:41,189

WILL YOU BE
A HELPER, TOO?

197
00:08:44,327 --> 00:08:45,810
YOU WILL?

198
00:08:45,844 --> 00:08:48,947
GREAT. THEN WE CAN LOOK
FOR MORE BLUE'S CLUES.

00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:52,465
NOW WE CAN
PLAY HOUSE.

200
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:54,499
WHERE'S
OUR HOUSE?

201
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,534
HOW CAN WE PLAY HOUSE
WITHOUT A HOUSE?

202
00:08:57,568 --> 00:08:58,949
OH, OH, OH.

203
00:08:58,981 --> 00:09:01,740

IT'S A HOUSE!

213

CAN BE THE MEATBALLS.
