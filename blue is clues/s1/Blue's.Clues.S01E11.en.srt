00:17:25,931 --> 00:17:27.379


364
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:29.551


365
00:17:31,206 --> 00:17:36.068
HMM... DO YOU SEE
HER GRANDMOTHER?

366
00:17:41,206 --> 00:17:44.517
 THAT ONE, THE BUTTERFLY.

367
00:17:44,551 --> 00:17:48.172
WOW! A BUTTERFLY.

368
00:17:48,206 --> 00:17:49.655
WHEN I GROW UP

369
00:17:49,689 --> 00:17:52.655
I'LL TURN
INTO A BUTTERFLY...

370
00:17:52,689 --> 00:17:55.413
JUST LIKE
MY GRANDMOTHER.

371
00:17:55,448 --> 00:17:59.862
THAT WAS SO COOL.

372
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:07.827
HI, STEVE.

373
00:18:07,862 --> 00:18:10.827
OH, HA, IT'S A TADPOLE.

374
00:18:10,862 --> 00:18:12.793
HELLO, TADPOLE.

375
00:18:12,827 --> 00:18:15.517
UH, WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO DO?

376
00:18:15,551 --> 00:18:16.931
I'M PRACTICING

377
00:18:16,965 --> 00:18:19.689
BUT I COULD USE
A LITTLE HELP FROM MY MOM.

378
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:20.965
COULD YOU GET HER?

379
00:18:25,068 --> 00:18:26.206


380
00:18:26,241 --> 00:18:27.551


381
00:18:27,586 --> 00:18:31.379
WILL YOU HELP
FIND TADPOLE'S MOM?

382
00:18:34,517 --> 00:18:36.827
 RIGHT THERE.

383
00:18:36,862 --> 00:18:38.379
 THE GREEN FROG.

384
00:18:38,413 --> 00:18:40.034
AWESOME.

385
00:18:40,068 --> 00:18:43.620
THE FROG IS
TADPOLE'S MOM.

386
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:45.206


387
00:18:47,931 --> 00:18:49.655
BUT HOW?

388
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52.793
WHEN I GROW UP

389
00:18:52,827 --> 00:18:55.068
I'LL BE ABLE TO HOP

390
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:57.137
JUST LIKE MY MOM.

391
00:18:57,172 --> 00:19:00.241
FIRST I'LL GROW LEGS.

392
00:19:00,275 --> 00:19:03.034
THEN I'LL GROW ARMS.

393
00:19:03,068 --> 00:19:06.000
THEN MY TAIL WILL GET
SMALLER AND SMALLER

394
00:19:06,034 --> 00:19:07.172
UNTIL IT'S GONE.

395
00:19:07,206 --> 00:19:11.482
THAT'S HOW YOU
BECOME A FROG.

396
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13.275
BUT THAT'S
NOT TILL LATER.

397
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:16.827
THAT IS AMAZING.

398
00:19:16,862 --> 00:19:19.379
HEY, WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE GO LOOK

399
00:19:19,413 --> 00:19:21.310

00:19:25,413 --> 00:19:26.896
 A CLUE!

403
00:19:26,931 --> 00:19:28.068
WHAT?

404
00:19:28,103 --> 00:19:31.379
OH, A CLUE!

405
00:19:31,413 --> 00:19:33.448
YOU SEE A CLUE! WHERE?

406
00:19:35,379 --> 00:19:37.931
WHERE? I, I DON'T SEE THE CLUE.

407
00:19:37,965 --> 00:19:40.793
I CAN'T... WHAT?

408
00:19:40,827 --> 00:19:41.965

409
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44.137
 BEHIND YOU.

410
00:19:44,172 --> 00:19:46.137
THE CLUE!

411
00:19:48,448 --> 00:19:50.551
IT'S A, A, A WHEEL.

412
00:19:50,586 --> 00:19:51.827
HUH, YEAH.

413
00:19:51,862 --> 00:19:54.068
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT WE DO NOW.

414
00:19:54,103 --> 00:19:56.068
PUT IT IN OUR HANDY-DANDY...

415
00:19:56,103 --> 00:19:57.241
 NOTEBOOK.

416
00:19:57,275 --> 00:19:58.379
NOTEBOOK.

417
00:19:58,413 --> 00:20:00.413
HA-HA.

418
00:20:00,448 --> 00:20:02.965
HMM.

419
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04.206
OKAY.

420
00:20:04,241 --> 00:20:07.275
A BIG CIRCLE...

421
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:10.068
A LITTLE CIRCLE INSIDE...

422
00:20:10,103 --> 00:20:13.482
LINES DOWN HERE...

423
00:20:13,517 --> 00:20:17.275
A DOT FOR THE HUB,
AND WE HAVE OUR WHEEL.

424
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:22.206
HMM, WELL, A WHEEL
IS OUR THIRD CLUE.

425
00:20:24,068 --> 00:20:26.344
WE HAVE ALL THREE CLUES.

426
00:20:26,379 --> 00:20:28.344
WE HAVE ALL THREE CLUES!

427
00:20:28,379 --> 00:20:31.206
YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S TIME FOR,
OUR...

428
00:20:31,241 --> 00:20:32.551
 THINKING CHAIR.

429
00:20:32,586 --> 00:20:34.206
THINKING CHAIR. COME ON.

430
00:20:34,241 --> 00:20:37.000
AH... HEY, BLUE.

431
00:20:37,034 --> 00:20:43.586
NOW THAT WE'RE IN OUR
THINKING CHAIR, LET'S THINK.

432
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:47.586
OKAY, SO, WE'RE TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT

433
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:53.724
WHAT BLUE WANTS TO TRY TO DO
TODAY, AND OUR CLUES ARE:

434
00:20:53,758 --> 00:20:55.034
A HORN...

435
00:20:55,068 --> 00:20:57.137


436
00:20:57,172 --> 00:21:01.310
A BASKET...

437
00:21:01,344 --> 00:21:06.000
AND A WHEEL.

438
00:21:06,034 --> 00:21:10.275
SO, WHAT COULD BLUE
WANT TO TRY TO DO

439
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:15.931
WITH A HORN, A BASKET,
AND A WHEEL?

440
00:21:15,965 --> 00:21:17.758
OH, OH.

441
00:21:17,793 --> 00:21:21.655
COULD, COULD SHE WANT TO PUT
THE WHEEL IN THE BASKET

442
00:21:21,689 --> 00:21:23.551
AND THEN HONK THE HORN?

443
00:21:23,586 --> 00:21:25.758
 NO.

444
00:21:25,793 --> 00:21:27.344
NO.

445
00:21:27,379 --> 00:21:31.068
I DON'T THINK SO.

446
00:21:31,103 --> 00:21:35.517
WHEEL, BASKET...

447
00:21:35,551 --> 00:21:37.724
 RIDE A BICYCLE.

448
00:21:37,758 --> 00:21:39.413

00:21:40,689 --> 00:21:42.862
BLUE WANTS TO TRY
TO RIDE A BICYCLE

451
00:21:42,896 --> 00:21:44.413
WITH A HORN SHE CAN HONK

452
00:21:44,448 --> 00:21:46.482
A BASKET TO PUT THINGS IN

453
00:21:46,517 --> 00:21:50.620
AND A WHEEL, BE...
