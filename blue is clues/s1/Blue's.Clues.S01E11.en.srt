 RIGHT THERE.

362
00:18:36,745 --> 00:18:38,261
 THE GREEN FROG.

363
00:18:38,295 --> 00:18:39,914
AWESOME.

364
00:18:39,948 --> 00:18:43,496
THE FROG IS
TADPOLE'S MOM.

365
00:18:47,803 --> 00:18:49,525
BUT HOW?

366
00:18:50,869 --> 00:18:52,660
WHEN I GROW UP

367
00:18:52,694 --> 00:18:54,933
I'LL BE ABLE TO HOP

368
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:57,000
JUST LIKE MY MOM.

369
00:18:57,035 --> 00:19:00,101
FIRST I'LL GROW LEGS.

370
00:19:00,135 --> 00:19:02,891
THEN I'LL GROW ARMS.

371
00:19:02,925 --> 00:19:05,854
THEN MY TAIL WILL GET
SMALLER AND SMALLER

372
00:19:05,888 --> 00:19:07,025
UNTIL IT'S GONE.

373
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:11,331
THAT'S HOW YOU
BECOME A FROG.

374
00:19:11,365 --> 00:19:13,122
BUT THAT'S
NOT TILL LATER.

375
00:19:13,157 --> 00:19:16,670

393
00:19:55,907 --> 00:19:57,044
 NOTEBOOK.

394
00:19:57,078 --> 00:19:58,181
NOTEBOOK.

395
00:19:58,215 --> 00:20:00,213
HA-HA.

396
00:20:00,248 --> 00:20:02,762
HMM.

397
00:20:02,797 --> 00:20:04,002
OKAY.

398
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:07,068
A BIG CIRCLE...

399
00:20:07,103 --> 00:20:09,858
A LITTLE CIRCLE INSIDE...

400
00:20:09,893 --> 00:20:13,269
LINES DOWN HERE...

401
00:20:13,303 --> 00:20:17,058
A DOT FOR THE HUB,
AND WE HAVE OUR WHEEL.

402
00:20:17,093 --> 00:20:21,984
HMM, WELL, A WHEEL
IS OUR THIRD CLUE.

403
00:20:23,844 --> 00:20:26,118
WE HAVE ALL THREE CLUES.

00:20:26,153 --> 00:20:28,116
WE HAVE ALL THREE CLUES!

405
00:20:28,151 --> 00:20:30,975
YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S TIME FOR,
OUR...

406
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:32,318
 THINKING CHAIR.

407
00:20:32,353 --> 00:20:33,972
THINKING CHAIR. COME ON.

408
00:20:34,007 --> 00:20:36,763
AH... HEY, BLUE.

409
00:20:36,797 --> 00:20:43,342
NOW THAT WE'RE IN OUR
THINKING CHAIR, LET'S THINK.

410
00:20:43,376 --> 00:20:47,338
OKAY, SO, WE'RE TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT

411
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:53,470
WHAT BLUE WANTS TO TRY TO DO
TODAY, AND OUR CLUES ARE:

412
00:20:53,504 --> 00:20:54,779
A HORN...

413
00:20:56,915 --> 00:21:01,049
A BASKET...

414
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:05,734
AND A WHEEL.

415
00:21:05,768 --> 00:21:10,005
SO, WHAT COULD BLUE
WANT TO TRY TO DO

416
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:15,655
WITH A HORN, A BASKET,
AND A WHEEL?

417
00:21:15,689 --> 00:21:17,480
OH, OH.

418
00:21:17,515 --> 00:21:21,373
COULD, COULD SHE WANT TO PUT
THE WHEEL IN THE BASKET

419
00:21:21,407 --> 00:21:23,267
AND THEN HONK THE HORN?

420
00:21:23,302 --> 00:21:25,472
 NO.

421
00:21:25,507 --> 00:21:27,057
NO.

422
00:21:27,092 --> 00:21:30,777
I DON'T THINK SO.

423
00:21:30,812 --> 00:21:35,221
WHEEL, BASKET...

424
00:21:35,255 --> 00:21:37,426

A BASKET TO PUT THINGS IN

430
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:50,309
