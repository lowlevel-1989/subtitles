OOH, UH...

116
00:05:50,781 --> 00:05:54,949

THE WAGON IS LOOKING
A LITTLE SHABBY.

117
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:02,769

TO GIVE YOUR WAGON
A NEW COAT OF PAINT.

00:06:25,195 --> 00:06:27,193
WHICH ARE THE COLOR...

126
00:06:27,227 --> 00:06:29,122

127
00:06:29,157 --> 00:06:31,430

128
00:06:31,464 --> 00:06:34,461
HMM... DO WE HAVE
PINK PAINT?

129
00:06:34,496 --> 00:06:37,149
 NO.... NO.

130
00:06:37,183 --> 00:06:40,421
WE DON'T HAVE
PINK PAINT?

131
00:06:41,627 --> 00:06:43,108
GOOD IDEA, BLUE.

132
00:06:43,143 --> 00:06:45,175
LET'S MAKE
THE COLOR PINK PAINT.

133
00:06:46,863 --> 00:06:49,377
HOW DO WE DO THAT?

134
00:06:52,926 --> 00:06:54,097
OH...

135
00:06:54,132 --> 00:06:57,473
OH, MAYBE WE SHOULD
MIX A COLOR WITH WHITE

136
00:06:57,507 --> 00:07:02,192
TO MAKE PINK.

137
00:07:02,226 --> 00:07:05,086
WELL, WHAT OTHER COLOR
LOOKS LIKE PINK

138
00:07:05,121 --> 00:07:07,359

140
00:07:11,803 --> 00:07:14,318
SEE HOW I KIND OF
LOOK LIKE PINK?

141
00:07:14,352 --> 00:07:17,694
RED? OKAY.

142
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:22,241
LET'S TRY MIXING
TOGETHER RED AND WHITE.

143
00:07:26,582 --> 00:07:28,786
IT WORKED!

144
00:07:28,821 --> 00:07:32,576

145
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,401

146
00:07:34,436 --> 00:07:35,573
OKAY.

147
00:07:35,607 --> 00:07:37,984

148
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:45,046
OKAY, LET'S PAINT
THE HANDLE NEXT.

149
00:07:45,081 --> 00:07:47,836
THIS COLOR IS...

150
00:07:47,871 --> 00:07:50,076
 ORANGE.

151
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,591
OH, YEAH.

152
00:07:51,626 --> 00:07:53,451

153
00:07:53,486 --> 00:07:55,966
WELL, DO WE HAVE
ORANGE PAINT?

154
00:07:56,001 --> 00:07:57,378
 NO.

155
00:07:57,413 --> 00:07:59,652
WE DON'T HAVE
ORANGE PAINT,
EITHER?

156
00:07:59,686 --> 00:08:01,512
YOU'RE KIDDING.

157
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:05,543
WELL...
WHAT SHOULD WE DO NOW?

158
00:08:05,577 --> 00:08:07,472
 MAKE ORANGE PAINT!

159
00:08:07,506 --> 00:08:09,849

00:08:09,883 --> 00:08:12,260
GOOD IDEA.

161
00:08:12,294 --> 00:08:13,914
WELL, OKAY.

162
00:08:13,948 --> 00:08:17,634
WHAT TWO COLORS CAN WE MIX
TOGETHER TO MAKE ORANGE?

163
00:08:19,804 --> 00:08:21,492
 YELLOW!

164
00:08:21,527 --> 00:08:23,628
I ALMOST
LOOK LIKE ORANGE.

165
00:08:23,662 --> 00:08:25,006
YELLOW!

166
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:31,448
WHAT OTHER COLOR
CAN WE MIX WITH YELLOW?

167
00:08:31,482 --> 00:08:33,239
 RED.

168
00:08:33,273 --> 00:08:36,649
I ALMOST LOOK
LIKE ORANGE, TOO.

169
00:08:36,684 --> 00:08:37,890

170
00:08:37,924 --> 00:08:40,852

176
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,375

185
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:41,481
AND THEN WE CAN LOOK
FOR MORE BLUE'S CLUES.

186
00:09:41,516 --> 00:09:42,790
HOW CAN WE HELP?

187
00:09:42,825 --> 00:09:46,545
WELL, WE'RE
TRYING TO MAKE
A BIGGER SAILBOAT

188
00:09:46,579 --> 00:09:48,129
WITH THESE SHAPES.

189
00:09:48,164 --> 00:09:50,679
I'M NOT SURE
WE CAN DO IT.

190
00:09:50,713 --> 00:09:53,366
I BET WE CAN.

191
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,503
WILL YOU HELP?

192
00:09:54,537 --> 00:09:56,501
OH, GOOD, COME ON.

193
00:09:56,535 --> 00:09:58,499
OKAY--
WE NEED A SHAPE

194
00:09:58,533 --> 00:10:02,115
THAT WILL BE
THE BOTTOM
OF THE SAILBOAT.

195
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,494
OKAY.

196
00:10:05,836 --> 00:10:07,524
HMM...

197
00:10:07,558 --> 00:10:11,348
WELL...

198
00:10:11,382 --> 00:10:13,346
WHAT SHAPE
COULD WE USE

199
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,515
TO MAKE THE BOTTOM
OF THE SAILBOAT?

200
00:10:18,513 --> 00:10:19,650
 NO.

201
00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:21,648
 NO.

202
00:10:22,647 --> 00:10:23,784
 YES.

203
00:10:26,953 --> 00:10:28,917
YEAH.

204
00:10:28,951 --> 00:10:33,498
THE SEMICIRCLE IS THE SHAPE
OF THE BOTTOM OF THE SAILBOAT.

205
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:35,117
YEAH.

206
00:10:35,151 --> 00:10:37,460
WOW, LOOK!

207
00:10:37,494 --> 00:10:40,008
OKAY, THE NEXT THING
WE HAVE TO MAKE

208
00:10:40,043 --> 00:10:41,593
IS THE MAST.

209
00:10:41,628 --> 00:10:45,383
THE POLE THAT HOLDS
THE SAIL UP.

210
00:10:45,417 --> 00:10:47,001
OKAY.

211
00:10:49,896 --> 00:10:53,271
HMM...

212
00:10:53,306 --> 00:10:56,441
CAN YOU FIND THE SHAPES
WE NEED TO PUT TOGETHER

213
00:10:56,475 --> 00:11:00,092
TO MAKE THE MAST?

214
00:11:01,436 --> 00:11:02,607
 NO.

215
00:11:04,467 --> 00:11:05,604
 YES!

216
00:11:09,462 --> 00:11:11,115
EXCELLENT.

217
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:15,904
ALL THOSE SQUARES PUT TOGETHER
MAKES A LONG RECTANGLE. COOL.

218
00:11:15,938 --> 00:11:18,935
IT WILL BE THE MAST!

219
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:21,071
WOW, LOOK.

220
00:11:21,105 --> 00:11:22,965
NOW WE NEED A SAIL.

221
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,445
OKAY.

222
00:11:26,479 --> 00:11:28,615
HMM...

223
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:34,265
WHAT TWO SHAPES COULD WE USE
TO MAKE THE SAIL? HMM...

224
00:11:35,264 --> 00:11:36,401
 NO.

225
00:11:37,468 --> 00:11:38,605
 NO.

226
00:11:40,362 --> 00:11:42,808
 YES!

227
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:49,215
OH, THE TRIANGLE
AND THE TRAPEZOID

228
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:53,039
PUT TOGETHER MAKE
THE SAIL... YES.

229
00:11:53,073 --> 00:11:54,245
LIKE A BIG TRIANGLE.

230
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:55,898
WE DID IT!

231
00:11:55,932 --> 00:11:58,344
I KNEW WE COULD DO IT.

232
00:11:59,653 --> 00:12:01,100
GREAT!

233
00:12:01,134 --> 00:12:04,028
NOW WE CAN ALL GET
TO THE OTHER ISLAND

234
00:12:04,062 --> 00:12:05,922
ON OUR BIGGER SAILBOAT.

235
00:12:14,018 --> 00:12:15,362
BLUE?

236
00:12:18,255 --> 00:12:19,392
 A CLUE!

237
00:12:19,426 --> 00:12:20,701
 A CLUE.

238
00:12:20,736 --> 00:12:22,699
SUE?

239
00:12:22,734 --> 00:12:26,385
MY NAME'S NOT SUE, IT'S STEVE.

240
00:12:26,419 --> 00:12:29,761
 NO, IT'S A CLUE.

241
00:12:29,796 --> 00:12:31,208
OH.

242
00:12:31,242 --> 00:12:33,137
OH, YOU SEE A CLUE?

243
00:12:33,171 --> 00:12:35,100
WHERE?

244
00:12:35,135 --> 00:12:36,375
 OVER THERE.

245
00:12:36,409 --> 00:12:37,856
 ON THE WINDOW.

246
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,578
OH! A CLUE!

247
00:12:40,612 --> 00:12:43,575
OUR SECOND CLUE!

248
00:12:43,609 --> 00:12:48,294
LOOK AT THIS, THIS, THIS...

249
00:12:48,329 --> 00:12:51,015
WINDOW, RIGHT... COOL.

250
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:53,565
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT WE GOT TO DO.

251
00:12:53,599 --> 00:12:55,941
DRAW IT IN OUR HANDY-DANDY...

252
00:12:55,976 --> 00:12:57,182
 NOTEBOOK.

253
00:12:57,216 --> 00:12:58,353
NOTEBOOK.

254
00:12:58,387 --> 00:13:00,006
OKAY...

255
00:13:02,383 --> 00:13:04,485
A RECTANGLE...

256
00:13:07,103 --> 00:13:08,102
ONE CURTAIN...

257
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,237
THE OTHER CURTAIN...

258
00:13:11,271 --> 00:13:14,268
A LINE
AND A LITTLE SQUIGGLE...

259
00:13:14,303 --> 00:13:15,715
AND WE HAVE...

260
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,195
A WINDOW.

261
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:23,948
SO, WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT ELSE BLUE WANTS TO PAINT
IN HER PICTURE.

262
00:13:23,982 --> 00:13:26,601
THE FIRST CLUE WAS...

263
00:13:26,635 --> 00:13:30,459
HEY, WHAT WAS OUR FIRST CLUE?

264
00:13:30,493 --> 00:13:31,768
 A DOOR!

265
00:13:31,802 --> 00:13:35,213
OH, RIGHT, THAT DOOR.

266
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:40,173
AND NOW OUR SECOND CLUE
IS A WINDOW. HMM...

267
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:45,582
SO WHAT COULD BLUE WANT TO PAINT
THAT HAS A DOOR AND A WINDOW?

268
00:13:46,753 --> 00:13:49,784
A SCHOOL?

269
00:13:49,818 --> 00:13:54,642
UH... I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK
FOR ONE MORE OF BLUE'S CLUES

270
00:13:54,676 --> 00:13:57,294

WE'RE MAKING THINGS

295
00:14:53,789 --> 00:14:57,750
FIRST YOU MAKE A BALL,
LIKE THIS.

296
00:14:57,785 --> 00:15:01,230
THEN YOU PUT THEM TOGETHER.

297
00:15:01,264 --> 00:15:04,675
THESE ARE THE EYES.

298
00:15:07,809 --> 00:15:10,393

PUT THE MOUTH ON.

300
00:15:15,009 --> 00:15:18,489

301
00:15:19,866 --> 00:15:22,209
BYE-BYE.

00:15:25,757 --> 00:15:29,443
HEY, WE STILL HAVE TO LOOK
FOR OUR LAST BLUE'S CLUE

304
00:15:29,478 --> 00:15:33,405

WANTS TO PAINT IN HER PICTURE.

305
00:15:35,403 --> 00:15:37,056
COME ON.

306
00:15:37,091 --> 00:15:39,089
WHAT ARE YOU
BARKING AT, BLUE?

307
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:48,114
DID YOU SEE THAT?

308
00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:52,868
BLUE JUST WENT RIGHT
INTO THE PICTURE
OF THAT MUSEUM.

309
00:15:52,902 --> 00:15:56,209
HEY, DO YOU THINK
IF WE GO, TOO

310
00:15:56,244 --> 00:15:59,964
WE MIGHT FIND
ANOTHER BLUE'S CLUE?

311
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:05,166
♪ BLUE SKIDDOO, WE CAN, TOO.

312
00:16:10,746 --> 00:16:14,571
WOW... A MUSEUM.

313
00:16:14,605 --> 00:16:20,496
HEY, LOOK AT ALL
THESE GREAT WORKS OF ART.

314
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:23,596

315
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:29,142
PAINTINGS, SCULPTURES,
DRAWINGS...

316
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,691
BARKING?

317
00:16:34,998 --> 00:16:38,064
LOOK AT THESE WORKS OF ART.

318

HI, STEVE, HI, BLUE.

319
00:16:39,683 --> 00:16:42,060
OUR PICTURES
ARE ALL OUT OF ORDER.

320
00:16:42,095 --> 00:16:44,988
THEY DON'T TELL
MUCH OF A STORY THIS WAY.

321
00:16:45,023 --> 00:16:48,295
DO YOU WANT TO HELP
THIS LITTLE CHICK?

322
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:49,638
OKAY.

323
00:16:49,673 --> 00:16:51,947
AND THEN WE'LL LOOK
FOR MORE BLUE'S CLUES.

324
00:16:51,981 --> 00:16:54,771
OKAY, SO...

325
00:16:54,806 --> 00:17:00,525
WHICH ONE OF THESE PICTURES
SHOULD COME FIRST?

326
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:06,208
 THAT ONE, THAT ONE.

327
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:11,685
THIS ONE?

328
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,097
EXCELLENT. OKAY...

329
00:17:14,131 --> 00:17:22,468
SO, ONE DAY, A PUPPY STARTED TO
PAINT A PICTURE ON A SUNNY DAY.

330
00:17:22,503 --> 00:17:24,569
OKAY.

331
00:17:24,603 --> 00:17:29,185
NOW...
IF THAT'S THE BEGINNING

332
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:35,868
WHICH ONE OF THESE PICTURES
SHOWS THE ENDING?

333
00:17:40,037 --> 00:17:41,346
 THAT ONE... THAT ONE.

334
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,307
GREAT!

335
00:17:45,342 --> 00:17:48,545
SO, THE ENDING
OF THE PICTURE STORY IS:

336
00:17:48,579 --> 00:17:53,678
THE PUPPY HAS FINISHED
HER PAINTING.

337
00:17:53,712 --> 00:17:58,363
OH, AND IT STARTED TO RAIN.

338
00:17:58,398 --> 00:17:59,982
SO...

339
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:05,769
HOW DOES THE MIDDLE GO?

340
00:18:08,491 --> 00:18:09,627
 THAT ONE.

341
00:18:09,662 --> 00:18:11,143
 YEAH.

342
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:16,173
LIKE THIS?

343
00:18:16,207 --> 00:18:17,723
OKAY.

344
00:18:17,757 --> 00:18:18,860
LET'S CHECK IT OUT.

345
00:18:21,202 --> 00:18:25,026
ONE SUNNY DAY,
A MAGENTA-COLORED PUPPY

346
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:30,297
GOT A PIECE OF PAPER
AND STARTED TO PAINT A PICTURE.

347
00:18:30,331 --> 00:18:35,946
IT GOT A LITTLE CLOUDY OUT, BUT
SHE PAINTED A FARM ON A HILL.

348
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:38,771
SHE EVEN PAINTED A LITTLE CHICK
POPPING OUT THE WINDOW

349
00:18:38,805 --> 00:18:40,080
JUST TO SAY "HI."

350
00:18:40,114 --> 00:18:41,251
HI.

351
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,491
HI.

352
00:18:42,525 --> 00:18:45,385
AND FINALLY,
WHEN IT STARTED TO RAIN OUTSIDE

353
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,003
THE PUPPY HAD FINISHED
HER PAINTING.

354
00:18:48,037 --> 00:18:49,381
THE END.

355
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,276
THAT'S GR--

356
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,584
THAT'S GREAT.

357
00:18:52,619 --> 00:18:54,789
THANKS FOR HELPING.

358
00:18:54,824 --> 00:18:56,098
THANK YOU.

359
00:18:56,133 --> 00:18:58,165
OH... HEY...

360
00:18:59,302 --> 00:19:01,438
WHERE DID BLUE GO?

361
00:19:01,472 --> 00:19:04,159
 SHE WENT THAT WAY.

362
00:19:04,194 --> 00:19:05,951
THIS WAY?

363
00:19:05,985 --> 00:19:07,191
THANKS.

364
00:19:10,395 --> 00:19:15,458
OH, LOOK,
IT'S A SCULPTURE OF OUR HOUSE.

365
00:19:15,492 --> 00:19:20,936
HEY, BUT IT LOOKS LIKE
SOMETHING'S MISSING.

366
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:22,865
 A CLUE!

367
00:19:22,899 --> 00:19:24,932
