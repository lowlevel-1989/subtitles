THEN THEY WON'T
BE WRINKLED.

267
00:13:48,168 --> 00:13:50,651

THE CLEAN STUFF AWAY.

268
00:13:50,686 --> 00:13:52,513

403
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,651
THINKING CHAIR.

404
00:20:17,686 --> 00:20:19,100
COME ON.

405
00:20:22,617 --> 00:20:26,237
NOW THAT WE'RE IN
OUR THINKING CHAIR...

406
00:20:26,272 --> 00:20:27,513
LET'S THINK.

407
00:20:29,789 --> 00:20:35,651
NOW, WE NEED TO THINK
ABOUT WHAT BLUE NEEDS TO DO.

408
00:20:35,686 --> 00:20:37,410
HMM.

409
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:41,720
OUR CLUES ARE BUBBLES...

410
00:20:41,755 --> 00:20:44,582
A TOWEL...

411
00:20:44,617 --> 00:20:45,651
AND...

412
00:20:45,686 --> 00:20:46,651
 SOAP.

413
00:20:46,686 --> 00:20:47,962
SOAP.

414
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:49,755
HMM.

415
00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:57,237
NOW WHAT WOULD BLUE NEED TO DO
WITH BUBBLES, A TOWEL AND SOAP?

416
00:20:57,272 --> 00:21:00,824
OH, WELL, DOES SHE NEED
TO PUT THE BUBBLES

417
00:21:00,858 --> 00:21:03,479
BETWEEN THE TOWEL AND THE SOAP

418
00:21:03,513 --> 00:21:06,272
AND, AND MAKE A BUBBLE SANDWICH?

419
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:07,306
 NO.

420
00:21:07,341 --> 00:21:08,789
 NO.

421
00:21:08,824 --> 00:21:11,237
NO.

422
00:21:11,272 --> 00:21:17,686
WELL, WHAT WOULD YOU DO
WITH BUBBLES, A TOWEL AND SOAP?

423
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,789
 A BATH!

424
00:21:18,824 --> 00:21:20,203

BATH?

427
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:25,824
BATH!

428
00:21:25,858 --> 00:21:26,824
THAT'S IT!

429
00:21:26,858 --> 00:21:27,893
OF COURSE!

430
00:21:27,927 --> 00:21:30,548
BLUE NEEDS TO TAKE A BATH.

431
00:21:30,582 --> 00:21:34,617
SHE'S DIRTY, SO SHE NEEDS
TO TAKE A BATH, WITH BUBBLES

432
00:21:34,651 --> 00:21:36,651
AND USE SOAP TO CLEAN HERSELF

433
00:21:36,686 --> 00:21:39,168
AND DRY HERSELF OFF
WITH A TOWEL.

434
00:21:39,203 --> 00:21:42,479
