159
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,333
HERE YOU GO, MR. WOLF.

160
00:07:35,367 --> 00:07:37,700
THANKS, BUT I'M
NOT A WOLF.

161
00:07:37,733 --> 00:07:40,800

186
00:08:51,933 --> 00:08:53,400

OH, WELL, WHAT'S
THE NAME OF HIS BOOK?

188
00:08:57,767 --> 00:09:00,467
JACK AND THE BEANSTALK!

189
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,033
 OH, YEAH, JACK AND 
 THE BEANSTALK, RIGHT

190
00:09:03,067 --> 00:09:05,500

191
00:09:05,533 --> 00:09:09,233
THAT GREW INTO A GREAT,
BIG BEANSTALK, REMEMBER?

192

197
00:09:22,867 --> 00:09:24,533
Girl:
STEVE...

198
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:26,533
STEVE.

199
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:33,333

WELL, SHE'S...

204
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,967
 SWEEPING!

205
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,033
SWEEPING, RIGHT.

206
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:56,933
WELL, FIRST SHE WAS
SWEEPING, AND NOW SHE'S...

207
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,433
 DANCING.

208
00:09:59,467 --> 00:10:01,467
DANCING.

209
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,233
YEAH.

210
00:10:04,267 --> 00:10:08,467
SO, WHAT BOOK DO YOU THINK
SHE BELONGS IN?

211
00:10:13,367 --> 00:10:16,767
 THAT ONE.

212
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,367
THIS ONE?

213
00:10:19,467 --> 00:10:21,767
WELL, WHAT'S THE NAME
OF HER BOOK?

214
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,400
CINDERELLA!

215
00:10:23,433 --> 00:10:25,967
OH, RIGHT, CINDERELLA.

216
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,167
DO YOU MEAN
YOU'RE CINDERELLA?

217
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,867
YES.

218
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,333
WOW.

219
00:10:31,367 --> 00:10:35,533
SHE REALLY IS CINDERELLA,
REMEMBER, BECAUSE SHE SWEEPS UP

220
00:10:35,567 --> 00:10:38,600
AND THEN SHE GOES
TO THE BALL AND DANCES.

221
00:10:38,633 --> 00:10:41,333
BUT THEY WON'T LET
ME GO TO THE BALL.

222
00:10:41,367 --> 00:10:45,300
OH, WELL, DON'T
GIVE UP, CINDERELLA.

223
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:49,067

00:11:57,667 --> 00:12:00,600
HI, STEVE!

246
00:12:00,633 --> 00:12:02,100
WE'RE ACTING OUT A STORY.

247
00:12:02,133 --> 00:12:03,900
IT'S "THE THREE LITTLE PIGS."

248
00:12:03,933 --> 00:12:07,333
LITTLE PIGS,
LITTLE PIGS,
LET ME COME IN.

249
00:12:07,367 --> 00:12:10,167
NOT BY THE HAIR
OF OUR CHIN-Y CHIN, CHIN.

250
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,533
THEN I'LL HUFF,
AND I'LL PUFF

251
00:12:12,567 --> 00:12:15,067
AND I'LL BLOW
YOUR HOUSE DOWN.

252
00:12:19,867 --> 00:12:21,833
YOU CAN'T BLOW
OUR HOUSE DOWN.

253
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:24,600
IT'S MADE
OUT OF BRICKS.

254
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,667
I GIVE UP.

255
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,933
All:
THE END.

256
00:12:32,967 --> 00:12:34,900
BYE.

257
00:12:41,067 --> 00:12:43,800
 A CLUE!

258
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:46,333
A CLUE?

259
00:12:46,367 --> 00:12:48,700
WHERE? WHERE'S THE CLUE?

260
00:12:48,733 --> 00:12:51,300

CHAIR, RIGHT.

265
00:13:00,067 --> 00:13:01,133
A LITTLE CHAIR.

266
00:13:01,167 --> 00:13:01,867
YEAH.

267
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,100

 NOTEBOOK!

271
00:13:07,367 --> 00:13:08,833
NOTEBOOK.

00:13:08,867 --> 00:13:13,100
OKAY, SO, WE HAVE A CHAIR.

273
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,333
START WITH TWO CIRCLES...

274
00:13:18,367 --> 00:13:21,600
LINES FOR THE BACK.

275
00:13:21,633 --> 00:13:26,533
KIND OF A RECTANGLE
FOR THE SEAT AND LEGS.

276
00:13:28,867 --> 00:13:32,200
AND WE HAVE A CHAIR.

277
00:13:32,233 --> 00:13:33,367
WHAT WAS OUR FIRST CLUE?

278
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,367
 A BOWL!

279
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,367
 A BOWL.

280
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,100
OH, RIGHT, A BOWL.

281
00:13:38,133 --> 00:13:42,300
AND OUR SECOND CLUE IS A CHAIR?

282
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:45,400
A BOWL AND A CHAIR?

283
00:13:45,433 --> 00:13:52,900
OH, WHAT STORY COULD BLUE WANT
TO PLAY WITH A BOWL AND A CHAIR?

284
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:55,433
I THINK WE BETTER FIND
OUR LAST BLUE'S CLUE.

285
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:56,900

00:14:21,733 --> 00:14:23,067
AND BLUE NEEDS TO BE

295
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,733

00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:55,933
THAT'S ME.

309
00:14:55,967 --> 00:14:58,300
"WHO FOUND
A GREEN-STRIPED COOKIE."

310
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:01,700
OOH, LOOK AT THAT
GREEN-STRIPED COOKIE.

311
00:15:01,733 --> 00:15:02,700
"THE COOKIE..."

312
00:15:02,733 --> 00:15:03,700
COOKIE.

313
00:15:03,733 --> 00:15:05,167
"MADE THE KING..."

314
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,067
THAT'S ME.

315
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,733
"SO JOLLY

316
00:15:07,767 --> 00:15:09,067
HAPPY, HAPPY, HAPPY.

317
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,267
"THAT THE KING..."

318
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,333
THAT'S ME.

319
00:15:11,367 --> 00:15:13,400
"DANCED ALL AROUND
THE KINGDOM."

320
00:15:13,433 --> 00:15:15,400
LOOK OUT, KINGDOM,
HERE I COME.

321
00:15:15,433 --> 00:15:17,400
I'M HOPPING-ALL-OVER KING.

322
00:15:17,433 --> 00:15:18,400
 NO!

323
00:15:18,433 --> 00:15:19,467
UH, KING?

324
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,267
WHAT CAN I DO
FOR YOU, BUNNY?

325
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,467
THAT'S NOT THE WAY
THE STORY GOES.

326
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,467
LISTEN.

327
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:31,267
"THE HAPPY KING DANCED
ALL AROUND THE KINGDOM."

328
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:38,233
NOW, THAT'S HOW IT GOES.

329
00:15:38,267 --> 00:15:39,833
LOOK AT ME, I'M DANCING.

330
00:15:39,867 --> 00:15:40,967
I'M ALL SHOOK UP.

THAT'S ME.

333
00:15:43,667 --> 00:15:45,767
"PUT HIS FAVORITE
GREEN COOKIE..."

334
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,767
COOKIE.

335
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,767
"IN HIS POCKET
FOR LATER."

336
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,367
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
GREEN-STRIPED COOKIE

337
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,533
YOU LOOK SO GOOD

338
00:15:52,567 --> 00:15:55,100
THE KING'S GOING
TO EAT YOU UP RIGHT NOW.

339
00:15:55,133 --> 00:15:56,100
NO.

340
00:15:56,133 --> 00:15:57,167
AHEM!

341
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,300
NOT NOW, BUNNY.

342
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,033
THE KING'S EATING
HIS COOKIE.

343
00:16:00,067 --> 00:16:02,233
THAT'S NOT THE WAY
THE STORY GOES.

344
00:16:02,267 --> 00:16:04,400
LISTEN.

345
00:16:04,433 --> 00:16:06,967
"THE HAPPY KING PUT
HIS FAVORITE COOKIE

346
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,867
IN HIS POCKET
FOR LATER."

347
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,933
COOKIE.

348
00:16:17,633 --> 00:16:19,467
ALL RIGHT, NOW.

349
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,633
"BUT SUDDENLY,
THE KING'S..."

350
00:16:21,667 --> 00:16:22,700
THAT'S ME.

351
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:24,033
"LITTLE SISTER..."

352
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:25,433
OOH, THAT'S HER.

353
00:16:25,467 --> 00:16:27,833
"CAME IN AND SAW
THAT THERE WERE

354
00:16:27,867 --> 00:16:31,267
"NO MORE GREEN-STRIPED
COOKIES LEFT.

00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,500
"SHE WAS SO SAD
THAT SHE CRIED.

00:16:34,533 --> 00:16:36,267
THE KING
STOPPED DANCING."

357
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,700
OH, DARLING.

358
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:40,800
OH, I SEE.

359
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,667
KING'S LITTLE SISTER'S
CRYING

360
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,600
BECAUSE THE KING--
THAT'S ME--

361
00:16:44,633 --> 00:16:47,333
ATE THE LAST
GREEN-STRIPED COOKIE.

362
00:16:47,367 --> 00:16:49,767
YOU'RE NOT REALLY CRYING,
ARE YOU, BLUE?

363
