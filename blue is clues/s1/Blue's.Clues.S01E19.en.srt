DO YOU KNOW?

123
00:05:36,097 --> 00:05:38,304
WHAT IS THAT A SHADOW OF?

124
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:41,856
 A TREE!

125
00:05:41,892 --> 00:05:43,684

THAT'S JUST
A SHADOW OF A TREE--

129
00:05:49,788 --> 00:05:51,925
WITH A LITTLE
BIRD'S NEST, EVEN.

130
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,270

138
00:06:18,442 --> 00:06:20,064
 A BIRDBATH!

139
00:06:20,097 --> 00:06:21,994
Both:
OH!

140
00:06:22,029 --> 00:06:23,753
HEY, WOW!

141
00:06:23,788 --> 00:06:26,477
YOU ARE
SO GOOD AT THIS.

142
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,649
IT'S JUST A SHADOW
OF A BIRDBATH.

143
00:06:28,684 --> 00:06:31,201
THAT'S NOT SCARY EITHER.

144
00:06:31,235 --> 00:06:32,511
ARE YOU READY?

145
00:06:32,546 --> 00:06:35,994
LET'S GO LOOK
FOR MORE BLUE'S CLUES.

146
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:42,235
 A CLUE, A CLUE.

147
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:45,029
DID YOU SAY
WHAT I THINK YOU SAID?

148
00:06:45,064 --> 00:06:46,580
A CLUE?

149
00:06:46,616 --> 00:06:49,788

00:06:57,097 --> 00:06:59,511
OUR SECOND CLUE.

152
00:07:00,822 --> 00:07:02,408
BUT WHAT IS IT?

153
00:07:02,442 --> 00:07:03,477
 A SHADOW!

154
00:07:03,511 --> 00:07:07,649
OH, A SHADOW, RIGHT.

155
00:07:07,684 --> 00:07:10,994
BUT A SHADOW OF WHAT?

156
00:07:18,788 --> 00:07:20,925
IT'S GONE!

157
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,960
OOH!

158
00:07:21,994 --> 00:07:23,546
WELL, WE BETTER HURRY UP

159
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,580
AND WRITE THIS CLUE DOWN
IN OUR HANDY-DANDY...

160
00:07:26,616 --> 00:07:27,753
 NOTEBOOK.

161
00:07:27,788 --> 00:07:30,340
NOTEBOOK, RIGHT.

162
00:07:30,373 --> 00:07:35,960
OKAY, SO... THIS... SHADOW.

163
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:38,616
CURVE UP HERE.

164
00:07:38,649 --> 00:07:40,856
SORT OF BUMPY AT THE TOP.

165
00:07:40,892 --> 00:07:42,822
A CURVE DOWN HERE.

166
00:07:42,856 --> 00:07:45,892
A WAVY LINE ON THE BOTTOM.

167
00:07:45,925 --> 00:07:49,064
WE HAVE THIS SHADOW.

168
00:07:49,097 --> 00:07:50,616
HMM.

169
00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:56,029
SO, WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT BLUE IS AFRAID OF.

170
00:07:57,097 --> 00:07:58,718
WHAT WAS OUR FIRST CLUE?

171
00:07:58,753 --> 00:07:59,718
 A FEATHER.

172
00:07:59,753 --> 00:08:02,616
RIGHT-- A FEATHER.

173
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:06,649
AND NOW WE HAVE THIS SHADOW.

174
00:08:06,684 --> 00:08:08,097
HMM.

175
00:08:08,132 --> 00:08:11,788
FEATHERS AND THIS SHADOW.

176
00:08:11,822 --> 00:08:17,340
WHAT COULD BLUE BE AFRAID OF
WITH FEATHERS AND THIS SHADOW?

177
00:08:17,373 --> 00:08:20,546
FEATHERS AND THIS SHADOW?

178
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,132
I THINK WE NEED TO FIND
OUR LAST BLUE'S CLUE.

179
00:08:25,235 --> 00:08:27,235
DO YOU HEAR THAT?

180
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:30,132
SOUNDS LIKE IT'S COMING FROM...

181
00:08:30,167 --> 00:08:31,132
THE KITCHEN.

182
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:33,029
LET'S GO.

183
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:36,064
 Both: 
ALLO!

184
00:08:36,097 --> 00:08:37,960

IN THE KITCHEN

369
00:17:40,649 --> 00:17:42,442
WITH HIS POTS
AND PANS.

370
00:17:42,477 --> 00:17:44,788
GOT TO GO, BYE!

371
00:17:46,408 --> 00:17:48,442

00:17:48,477 --> 00:17:50,580
OH, YOU'RE WELCOME... BOO.

373
00:17:55,994 --> 00:17:58,856
OH, WE STILL HAVE TO FIND
OUR LAST CLUE.

374
00:17:58,892 --> 00:18:00,064
LET'S GO.

375
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,684
IT'S JUST THE PHONE.

376
00:18:14,477 --> 00:18:15,649
HELLO?

377
00:18:15,684 --> 00:18:17,856

378
00:18:17,892 --> 00:18:19,649
Whoo.

379
00:18:19,684 --> 00:18:21,511
WHO IS THIS?

380
00:18:21,546 --> 00:18:23,270
Whoo!

381
00:18:23,304 --> 00:18:26,304

383
00:18:27,442 --> 00:18:28,546
 A CLUE, A CLUE!

384
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,616
WHO?

385
00:18:29,649 --> 00:18:31,546
Whoo, whoo!

386
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,960
I'LL BE WITH YOU
IN JUST ONE SECOND.

387
00:18:33,994 --> 00:18:36,340
I'M JUST TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT WHO...

388
00:18:36,373 --> 00:18:37,546
 NO, IT'S A CLUE!

389
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,201
A CLUE? YOU SEE A CLUE?

390
00:18:39,235 --> 00:18:41,580
Whoo, whoo.

391
00:18:41,616 --> 00:18:45,235
OH, I SEE A CLUE, TOO.

392
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:47,788
IT'S THIS SOUND.

393
00:18:47,822 --> 00:18:49,580
WHAT IS THIS SOUND?

394
00:18:49,616 --> 00:18:50,649
Whoo, whoo.

395
00:18:50,684 --> 00:18:51,788
 WHOO, WHOO.

396
00:18:51,822 --> 00:18:53,856
WHOO, WHOO, HUH!

397
00:18:53,892 --> 00:18:55,304
Whoo.

398
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,064
OKAY, WE KNOW WHAT TO DO.

399
00:18:57,097 --> 00:18:58,925
PUT IT IN OUR HANDY-DANDY...

400
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,340
 NOTEBOOK.

401
00:19:00,373 --> 00:19:02,477
NOTEBOOK.

402
00:19:02,511 --> 00:19:04,373
HMM, OKAY.

403
00:19:06,994 --> 00:19:11,304
THE SOUND IS KIND OF LIKE THIS.

404
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:14,925
LOTS OF CIRCLES, LIKE "Os".

405
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:21,546
AND WE HAVE "WHOO"
AS OUR THIRD CLUE.

406
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,477
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?

407
00:19:23,511 --> 00:19:25,373
WE'RE READY FOR OUR...

408
00:19:25,408 --> 00:19:26,511
 THINKING CHAIR!

409
00:19:26,546 --> 00:19:27,580
THINKING CHAIR.

410
00:19:27,616 --> 00:19:29,029
COME ON.

411
00:19:31,892 --> 00:19:38,442
OKAY, NOW THAT WE'RE IN
OUR THINKING CHAIR, LET'S THINK.

412
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:39,649
ALL RIGHT.

413
00:19:39,684 --> 00:19:42,856
SO, WE NEED
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT...

414
00:19:44,304 --> 00:19:47,892
WHAT BLUE IS AFRAID OF.

415
00:19:47,925 --> 00:19:53,064
AND OUR CLUES ARE A FEATHER...

416
00:19:53,097 --> 00:19:58,546
THIS SHADOW...

417
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:05,132
AND THIS SOUND: WHOO, WHOO.

418
00:20:05,167 --> 00:20:09,925
HMM, SO WHAT COULD
BLUE BE AFRAID OF

419
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,064
THAT HAS FEATHERS, THIS SHADOW

420
00:20:14,097 --> 00:20:18,442
AND MAKES THE SOUND
"WHOO, WHOO?"

421
00:20:18,477 --> 00:20:21,616
WELL, MAYBE...

422
00:20:21,649 --> 00:20:25,477
MAYBE BLUE'S AFRAID
OF A SHADOW-DANCING FEATHER.

423
00:20:27,097 --> 00:20:28,132
WHOO, WHOO.

424
00:20:28,167 --> 00:20:29,235
WHOO, WHOO.

425
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,270
 
NO.

426
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:35,994
NO, THAT'S NOT SCARY.

427
00:20:36,029 --> 00:20:41,960
WELL, WHAT COULD BLUE
BE AFRAID OF THAT HAS FEATHERS

428
00:20:41,994 --> 00:20:43,856
A SHADOW THAT LOOKS LIKE THIS

429
00:20:43,892 --> 00:20:49,684
AND MAKES THE SOUND
"WHOO, WHOO"?

430
00:20:49,718 --> 00:20:51,892
WELL, A BIRD HAS FEATHERS.

431
00:20:51,925 --> 00:20:53,925
BUT WHAT KIND OF BIRD...

432
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,408
 AN OWL!

433
00:20:55,442 --> 00:20:56,580
AN OWL?

434
00:20:58,616 --> 00:21:00,684
AN OWL.

435
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:01,753
THAT'S IT!

436
00:21:01,788 --> 00:21:03,616
THAT'S BRILLIANT.

437
00:21:03,649 --> 00:21:09,064
AN OWL HAS FEATHERS
AND ITS SHADOW LOOKS LIKE THIS

438
00:21:09,097 --> 00:21:13,373
AND AN OWL MAKES THE SOUND
"WHOO, WHOO."
