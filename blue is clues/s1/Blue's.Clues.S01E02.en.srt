00:05:20,118 --> 00:05:22,084
I AM SO SORRY,
TICKITY TOCK.

108
00:05:22,118 --> 00:05:24,567
I DIDN'T REALIZE
YOU WERE SLEEPING.

109
00:05:24,601 --> 00:05:26,291
THAT'S ALL RIGHT,
STEVE.

110
00:05:26,325 --> 00:05:29,877
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
SOME OF YOUR PIECES FLEW OFF.

111
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:32,325
YES, CAN YOU HELP ME
PUT THEM BACK ON?

112

CAN YOU HELP BLUE FIND
TICKITY TOCK'S HANDS FIRST?

118
00:05:50,118 --> 00:05:53,532
I NEED THEM TO POINT OUT
WHAT TIME IT IS, STEVE.

119
00:05:54,739 --> 00:05:56,222
 NO.

120
00:05:58,015 --> 00:05:59,498

123
00:06:05,877 --> 00:06:08,981
CAN YOU HELP FIND
WHAT TICKITY TOCK POINTS AT

124
00:06:09,015 --> 00:06:10,291

THANKS,
BUT I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING.

130
00:06:26,843 --> 00:06:29,394

146
00:07:11,118 --> 00:07:12,774
OH, THANKS, TICKITY TOCK.

147
00:07:14,325 --> 00:07:15,567

OOH... LOOKS LIKE WE DIDN'T
FINISH CLEANUP TIME AFTER ALL.

151
00:07:24,153 --> 00:07:25,670
SO, LET'S CLEAN THIS UP

152
00:07:25,705 --> 00:07:28,394
AND THEN WE CAN LOOK
FOR MORE BLUE'S CLUES

153
00:07:28,429 --> 00:07:30,394
AND FIGURE OUT
WHAT TIME IT IS.

154
00:07:30,429 --> 00:07:32,429
HEY...

155
00:07:34,222 --> 00:07:37,463
LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING'S MISSING

156
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:39,946
WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK
IT COULD BE?

157

00:08:54,981 --> 00:08:58,394
LOOKS LIKE ONE OF BLUE'S
BEDTIME TOYS IS MISSING.

178
00:09:02,153 --> 00:09:04,739

184
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,050
 BEAR STUFFED ANIMAL.

185
00:09:29,084 --> 00:09:30,153
WHAT? OH!

186
00:09:30,187 --> 00:09:34,291

THE BEAR STUFFED ANIMAL.

187
00:09:34,325 --> 00:09:36,498
HMM...

188
00:09:38,153 --> 00:09:40,325

YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY
ARE VERY GOOD AT THIS.

191
00:09:44,636 --> 00:09:47,187
HEY, LET'S GO LOOK
FOR MORE BLUE'S CLUES

192
00:09:47,222 --> 00:09:50,463
SO WE CAN FIND OUT WHAT
COMES AFTER CLEANUP TIME.

193
00:09:50,498 --> 00:09:52,050
RIGHT, BLUE?

194
00:09:53,981 --> 00:09:55,739
BLUE?

195
00:09:59,394 --> 00:10:01,015
 A CLUE!

196
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,153
WHAT?

197
00:10:02,187 --> 00:10:03,463
YOU SEE A CLUE?

198
00:10:03,498 --> 00:10:05,877
WHERE?

199
00:10:05,912 --> 00:10:08,187
 RIGHT BEHIND THE BOOKS.

200
00:10:11,256 --> 00:10:12,567
WHERE?

201
00:10:22,739 --> 00:10:24,291
IT'S A BOOK.

202
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,429
IT'S A BOOK.

203
00:10:27,463 --> 00:10:29,291
IT'S A CLUE!

204
00:10:29,325 --> 00:10:31,739
WE NEED OUR HANDY-DANDY...

205
00:10:31,774 --> 00:10:32,912
 NOTEBOOK.

206
00:10:32,946 --> 00:10:34,567
NOTEBOOK.

207
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:44,946
DRAW A COUPLE OF LINES
FOR THE SIDES...

208
00:10:44,981 --> 00:10:47,567
A RECTANGLE...

209
00:10:47,601 --> 00:10:49,774
AND LINES FOR THE PAGES...

210
00:10:49,808 --> 00:10:52,118

211
00:10:52,153 --> 00:10:53,256
A BOOK!

212
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,981
HMM.

213
00:10:56,015 --> 00:11:00,291
BLUE'S CLUES ARE GOING TO
TELL US WHAT IT IS TIME FOR.

214
00:11:00,325 --> 00:11:02,601
OUR FIRST CLUE WAS...

215
00:11:02,636 --> 00:11:03,981
 A BLANKET.

216
00:11:04,015 --> 00:11:06,256
OH, A BLANKET, RIGHT.

217
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:10,050
AND NOW WE HAVE A... BOOK.

218
00:11:10,084 --> 00:11:12,670
AND WE NEED TO KNOW
WHAT TIME IT IS.

219
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:17,394
WELL, WHAT DOES BLUE WANT
WITH A BLANKET AND A BOOK?

220
00:11:17,429 --> 00:11:21,636
OH, IS IT BLANKET AND BOOK TIME?

221
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,705
 NO!

222
00:11:23,739 --> 00:11:27,981
WELL, I THINK WE NEED
TO LOOK FOR ONE MORE BLUE'S CLUE

223
00:11:28,015 --> 00:11:30,670

224
00:11:30,705 --> 00:11:33,636
BUT WE GOT TO FIND BLUE FIRST.

225
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,705

HOW COULD WE HELP?

280
00:14:05,222 --> 00:14:08,153
