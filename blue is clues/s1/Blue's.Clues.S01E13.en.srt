00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,545
HI, OUT THERE!

2
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:10,513
IT'S ME, STEVE.

3
00:00:10,946 --> 00:00:13,749
HAVE YOU SEEN BLUE, MY PUPPY?

4
00:00:13,983 --> 00:00:15,250
 THERE SHE IS!

5
00:00:16,884 --> 00:00:18,419
COME ON IN.

6
00:00:30,783 --> 00:00:32,117
HI. COME ON IN.

7
00:00:30,867 --> 00:00:31,702
HI.

8
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:36,050
WE'RE JUST ABOUT TO GO
OUTSIDE AND... PLAY.

9
00:00:38,183 --> 00:00:39,483
HEY.

10
00:00:39,517 --> 00:00:45,117
HAVE YOU GROWN...
SINCE I SAW YOU LAST?

11
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:46,417
OH, YEAH. YEP.

12
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:47,583
LOOK AT THAT.

13
00:00:47,617 --> 00:00:49,883
YOU DO, YOU LOOK
A LITTLE BIT TALLER.

14
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:51,917
BLUE.

15
00:00:52,883 --> 00:00:54,083
UH-HUH.

16
00:00:57,317 --> 00:00:58,850
THERE YOU ARE, BLUE.

17
00:00:59,883 --> 00:01:00,850
BLUE?

18
00:01:01,917 --> 00:01:03,150
WHAT IS SHE DOING?

19
00:01:05,783 --> 00:01:06,750
OH, HEY.

20
00:01:07,783 --> 00:01:08,750
HEY.

21
00:01:08,783 --> 00:01:10,317
YOU KNOW, BLUE...

22
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,517
YOU DO LOOK LIKE
YOU'VE GROWN, TOO.

23
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:15,550
LET'S SEE.

24
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:22,150
OH, YEAH.

25
00:01:22,183 --> 00:01:23,150
YEP.

26
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:24,150
LOOK AT THAT.

27
00:01:24,183 --> 00:01:26,183
WOW!

28
00:01:26,217 --> 00:01:28,383
YOU'VE GROWN THIS MUCH,
A WHOLE...

29
00:01:29,417 --> 00:01:30,517
OH, YEAH, BLUE.

30
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,883
WE WERE GOING
TO GO OUTSIDE AND PLAY.

31
00:01:33,917 --> 00:01:36,117
WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO PLAY? BALL?

32
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:39,017
NO?

33
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:41,817
WELL, WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO DO OUTSIDE TODAY?

34
00:01:44,617 --> 00:01:45,850
OH, OKAY.

35
00:01:45,883 --> 00:01:48,683
WE'LL PLAY "BLUE'S CLUES"
TO FIGURE IT OUT.

36
00:01:48,717 --> 00:01:50,550
I LOVE "BLUE'S CLUES."

37
00:01:52,217 --> 00:01:54,217
* WE ARE GONNA PLAY
BLUE'S CLUES *

38
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,417
* 'CAUSE IT'S A REALLY
GREAT GAME, YEAH! *

39
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:00,883
"BLUE'S CLUES" WILL TELL US WHAT
BLUE WANTS TO DO OUTSIDE TODAY.

40
00:02:00,917 --> 00:02:04,417
SO REMEMBER, BLUE'S PAW PRINT
WILL BE ON THE CLUES:

41
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:05,450
BLUE'S CLUES.

42
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,550
YOU, UH, YOU THOUGHT

43
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:14,217
I WAS GOING TO FORGET ABOUT
THAT PAW PRINT, DIDN'T YOU?

44
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,217
NOPE.

45
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:19,583
LET'S CLEAN IT UP WITH THIS.

46
00:02:19,617 --> 00:02:26,517
JUST A LITTLE WATER
WILL CLEAN THIS RIGHT... UP.

47
00:02:31,817 --> 00:02:33,150
OKAY.

48
00:02:33,183 --> 00:02:34,850

69
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:25,950

70
00:03:25,983 --> 00:03:28,183

00:03:28,217 --> 00:03:29,550
* BLUE'S CLUES! *

72
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,083
* WELL, WE SIT DOWN
IN OUR THINKING CHAIR *

73
00:03:31,117 --> 00:03:36,717
* AND THINK, THINK, THINK

74
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,050
* 'CAUSE WHEN WE USE OUR MINDS,
TAKE A STEP AT A TIME *

75
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:42,150
* WE CAN DO ANYTHING...

76
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,350
* THAT WE WANT TO DO.

77
00:03:47,883 --> 00:03:48,850
OKAY.

78
00:03:48,883 --> 00:03:51,550
WE'RE ALL READY TO GROW.

79
00:03:53,017 --> 00:03:54,517
I MEAN... GO.

80
00:03:57,617 --> 00:03:59,650
HMM.

81
00:03:59,683 --> 00:04:02,617
WHICH WAY DID BLUE GROW?

82
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:03,917
I MEAN... GO.

83
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,583
 SHE WENT THAT WAY.

84
00:04:05,617 --> 00:04:07,283
OH, THIS WAY.

85
00:04:07,317 --> 00:04:08,350
OKAY.

86
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:12,483
* WE ARE LOOKING
FOR BLUE'S CLUES *

87
00:04:12,517 --> 00:04:14,417
* WE ARE LOOKING
FOR BLUE'S CLUES *

88
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:16,383
* WE ARE LOOKING
FOR BLUE'S CLUES *

89
00:04:16,417 --> 00:04:18,283
* I WONDER WHERE THEY ARE.

90
00:04:19,283 --> 00:04:21,417
 A CLUE, A CLUE!

91
00:04:23,217 --> 00:04:24,450
DID YOU SEE A CLUE?

92
00:04:24,483 --> 00:04:26,050
WHERE?
WHERE'S THE CLUE?

93
00:04:27,683 --> 00:04:29,917
 BEHIND YOU.

94
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:30,950
OH.

95
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:34,950
THE CLUE!

96
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,817
YOU KNOW HOW YOU CAN
TELL IT'S A CLUE?

97
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:40,883
BECAUSE IT HAS BLUE'S
PAW PRINT ON IT.

98
00:04:40,917 --> 00:04:43,183
WE JUST FOUND
OUR FIRST CLUE.

99
00:04:43,217 --> 00:04:44,383
AND IT'S DIRT!

100
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:48,650
DIRT?

101
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,450
OUR FIRST CLUE IS DIRT?

102
00:04:51,483 --> 00:04:53,317
WHAT...

103
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,850
WELL, NOW WHAT DO WE DO?

104
00:04:54,883 --> 00:04:55,950
 NOTEBOOK!

105
00:04:55,983 --> 00:04:58,250
RIGHT, PUT IT
IN OUR HANDY-DANDY...

106
00:04:58,283 --> 00:05:00,150
NOTEBOOK.

107
00:05:00,183 --> 00:05:06,517
OKAY, SO, A BIG CLUMP OF...

108
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,550
DIRT.

109
00:05:08,717 --> 00:05:11,317
IT HAS SOME CURVY LINES
AT THE TOP.

110
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,717
A STRAIGHT LINE ON THE BOTTOM.

111
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:20,250
AND WE HAVE OUR... DIRT.

112
00:05:23,017 --> 00:05:28,950
SO WHAT COULD BLUE WANT TO DO
OUTSIDE TODAY... WITH DIRT?

113
00:05:28,983 --> 00:05:29,950
HMM...

114
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,817
OH, YOU, YOU THINK WE NEED

115
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:33,483
TO LOOK FOR MORE CLUES?

116
00:05:33,517 --> 00:05:34,550
YEAH, I...

117
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,650
Mr. Salt:
I THINK YOU GROW AND...

118
00:05:36,683 --> 00:05:38,783
Mrs. Pepper:
SQUEEZE OR SOMETHING.

119
00:05:38,817 --> 00:05:41,550
GROW?

120
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:44,283
LET'S GO SEE WHAT'S GROWING ON.

121
00:05:44,317 --> 00:05:46,350
OH, I MEAN...

122
00:05:46,383 --> 00:05:48,917
I MEAN GOING ON.

123
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,217
OH, DEAR.

124
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,217
FIRST YOU
GROW THE...

125
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,850
SQUEEZE
OR SOMETHING.

126
00:05:54,883 --> 00:05:56,717
HI, MR. SALT
AND MRS. PEPPER.

127
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,050
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

128
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,050
OH!

129
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,150
Both:
HI, STEVE.

130
00:06:00,183 --> 00:06:02,383
WE ARE TRYING
TO MAKE ORANGE JUICE.

131
00:06:02,417 --> 00:06:03,383
WILL YOU HELP?

132
00:06:03,417 --> 00:06:04,650
WILL YOU HELP, TOO?

133
00:06:04,683 --> 00:06:05,950
GREAT.

134
00:06:05,983 --> 00:06:08,417
THEN WE'LL LOOK
FOR MORE BLUE'S CLUES.

135
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,950
Both:
WHERE DOES ORANGE
JUICE COME FROM?

136
00:06:10,983 --> 00:06:11,983
WELL...

137
00:06:14,283 --> 00:06:16,583
THAT'S A
GOOD QUESTION.

138
00:06:16,617 --> 00:06:20,350
UM, WHERE DOES ORANGE
JUICE COME FROM?

139
00:06:20,383 --> 00:06:23,417
WELL, IT, IT COMES
FROM ORANGES, RIGHT.

140
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:27,050
AND... ORANGES
GROW ON...

141
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:28,083
 TREES.

142
00:06:28,117 --> 00:06:30,617
TREES. RIGHT.

143
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:37,650
AND, UH, ORANGE
TREES GROW FROM...

144
00:06:37,683 --> 00:06:38,650
 SEEDS.

145
00:06:38,683 --> 00:06:39,917
AH, VOILA!

146
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:43,517
Both:
ORANGE TREES GROW FROM SEEDS.

147
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:48,250
OH.
A SEED IS PLANTED.

148
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:51,650
AND THEN AN ORANGE
TREE GROWS.

149
00:06:56,217 --> 00:07:00,283
WELL... HOW DO WE
GET ORANGE JUICE?

150
00:07:00,317 --> 00:07:02,383
 PICK THE ORANGE.

151
00:07:02,417 --> 00:07:05,450
OH, AN ORANGE GETS PICKED
FROM THE TREE.

152
00:07:08,917 --> 00:07:10,017
HUH.

153
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:14,250
SO, WHERE DOES
ORANGE JUICE COME FROM?

154
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,817
 SQUEEZE THE ORANGE.

155
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:21,117
Steve:
AN ORANGE IS SQUEEZED...

156
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,750
AND THE JUICE IS
POURED INTO A CUP.

157
00:07:25,317 --> 00:07:26,583
WOW.

158
00:07:26,617 --> 00:07:29,483
Both:
THAT'S WHERE ORANGE
JUICE COMES FROM.

159
00:07:29,517 --> 00:07:32,350
OKAY, SO LET ME
GET THIS STRAIGHT.

160
00:07:32,383 --> 00:07:35,850
ORANGE JUICE COMES
FROM AN ORANGE TREE SEED

161
00:07:35,883 --> 00:07:37,250
THAT IS PLANTED.

162
00:07:40,317 --> 00:07:48,350
AND THEN, THE SEED GROWS
INTO A FULL-GROWN ORANGE TREE.

163
00:07:48,383 --> 00:07:53,583
AND THEN, AN ORANGE
IS PICKED FROM THE TREE.

164
00:07:53,617 --> 00:07:58,250
AND THE JUICE IS
SQUEEZED INTO A CUP.

165
00:07:58,283 --> 00:07:59,617
GOOD JOB.

166
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:00,683
UH...

167
00:08:00,717 --> 00:08:01,650
YOU KNOW...

168
00:08:01,683 --> 00:08:03,717
YOU CAN GET
ORANGE JUICE

169
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,917
FROM A CARTON

170
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,017
Both:
OUT OF THE FRIDGE!

171
00:08:09,817 --> 00:08:11,050
OH, THAT'S BLUE.

172
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:12,117
WE BETTER GO.

173
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:14,517
BYE, MR. SALT
AND MRS. PEPPER.

174
00:08:15,917 --> 00:08:18,450
* WE ARE LOOKING
FOR BLUE'S CLUES *

175
00:08:18,483 --> 00:08:23,050
* WE ARE LOOKING FOR
BLUE'S CLUES... *

176
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:24,050
 A CLUE!

177
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:25,083
 A CLUE!

178
00:08:25,117 --> 00:08:27,317
YEP, THE SKY IS BLUE.

179
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,917
 NO, A CLUE!

180
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:32,917
OH, A CLUE.

181
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,350
YOU DO SEE A CLUE.

182
00:08:34,383 --> 00:08:35,383
REALLY?

183
00:08:35,417 --> 00:08:36,917
WELL, WHERE IS IT?

184
00:08:41,417 --> 00:08:43,083
WHERE'S THE CLUE?

185
00:08:43,117 --> 00:08:44,450
 RIGHT THERE.

186
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:51,983
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.

187
00:08:52,017 --> 00:08:53,017
I...

188
00:08:57,117 --> 00:08:58,617
THE CLUE!

189
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,550
THE CLUE!

190
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:04,950
IT'S, IT'S A, A,
A WATERING CAN.

191
00:09:04,983 --> 00:09:06,183
YEAH!

192
00:09:06,217 --> 00:09:11,350
WELL, THIS WATERING CAN
IS OUR SECOND CLUE.

193
00:09:11,383 --> 00:09:12,550
NOW WHAT DO WE DO?

194
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:13,550
 THE NOTEBOOK.

195
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,017
RIGHT, PUT IT IN OUR...

196
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,450
NOTEBOOK.

197
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:23,117
OKAY, SO, A WATERING CAN HAS...

198
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:27,550
HERE'S A RECTANGLE FOR THE BODY.

199
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,117
THEN THE SPOUT.

200
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:33,950
OH YEAH, THE SPRINKLER ON THE
TOP THAT HAS SOME DOTS.

201
00:09:33,983 --> 00:09:36,517
AND THE HANDLE.

202
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,883
THERE.

203
00:09:37,917 --> 00:09:39,917
A WATERING CAN.

204
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,417
HMM.

205
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,717
SO, WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

206
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,450
WHAT BLUE WANTS
TO DO OUTSIDE TODAY.

207
00:09:46,483 --> 00:09:48,517
AND OUR FIRST CLUE WAS, WAS...

208
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,517
 DIRT.

209
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,550
DIRT, RIGHT.

210
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:52,417
HOW COULD I FORGET?

211
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:55,950
NOW, OUR SECOND CLUE
IS A WATERING CAN.

212
00:09:55,983 --> 00:09:58,783
HMM.

213
00:09:58,817 --> 00:10:04,483
WHAT COULD BLUE WANT TO DO
WITH DIRT AND A WATERING CAN?

214
00:10:04,517 --> 00:10:06,883
OOH, MAYBE, MAYBE...

215
00:10:06,917 --> 00:10:09,450
MAYBE WE SHOULD LOOK
FOR ONE MORE CLUE.

216
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:10,450
YEAH.

217
00:10:10,483 --> 00:10:12,583
I THINK THIS ONE
IS LONGER.

218
00:10:12,617 --> 00:10:13,583
DEFINITELY.

219
00:10:13,617 --> 00:10:14,617
COME ON.

220
00:10:15,617 --> 00:10:17,083
I'M NOT SURE,
SHOVEL.

221
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,050
I THINK THIS
ONE IS LONGER.

222
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,383
LOOK, THERE'S STEVE.

223
00:10:20,417 --> 00:10:21,583
MAYBE HE
CAN HELP.

224
00:10:21,617 --> 00:10:22,583
HEY, SHOVEL.

225
00:10:22,617 --> 00:10:23,583
HI, PAIL.

226
00:10:23,617 --> 00:10:24,583
HEY, BLUE.

227
00:10:24,617 --> 00:10:25,583
WHAT ARE YOU

228
00:10:25,617 --> 00:10:26,583
GUYS DOING?

229
00:10:26,617 --> 00:10:29,183
SHH!
WE'RE INVESTIGATING.

00:10:33,283 --> 00:10:36,783
WE WANT TO SEE
WHICH INCHWORM
IS LONGER.

233
00:10:36,817 --> 00:10:38,117
SWEATER-VEST MAKING?

234
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:41,017
Both:
INVESTIGATING!

235
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:42,017
WANT TO HELP?

236
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,750

WILL YOU HELP, TOO?

238
00:10:46,183 --> 00:10:47,217

239
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,217
THEN WE CAN GO

240
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,983
LOOK FOR MORE
BLUE'S CLUES.

241
00:10:50,017 --> 00:10:51,017
COME ON.

242
00:10:53,983 --> 00:10:57,083
I THINK THIS
ONE IS LONGER.

243
00:10:58,117 --> 00:11:00,350
HMM.

244
00:11:00,383 --> 00:11:01,350
CAN YOU TELL

245
00:11:01,383 --> 00:11:02,950
WHICH INCHWORM
IS LONGER?

246
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:07,350
WHICH ONE?

247
00:11:10,683 --> 00:11:11,850
 THAT ONE.

248
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,650
SEE?

249
00:11:17,683 --> 00:11:18,617
THE CURVED ONE

250
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:19,917
WAS REALLY LONGER.

251
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:20,917
YEAH.

252
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,350
IT KIND OF GREW.

253
00:11:22,383 --> 00:11:26,083
HEY! NICE
INVESTIGATING.

254
00:11:26,117 --> 00:11:28,817

INVESTIGATING THOSE PUDDLES.

258
00:11:36,283 --> 00:11:39,350
HEY, I THINK THAT PUDDLE
HAS MORE WATER.

259
00:11:39,383 --> 00:11:40,350
NO.

260
00:11:40,383 --> 00:11:42,517
MAYBE THIS ONE HAS
MORE WATER.

261
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:43,550
HEY, GUYS.

262
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:44,817

INVESTIGATING NOW?

264
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,017
THESE PUDDLES.

265
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:50,717
WHICH ONE DO YOU THINK
HAS MORE WATER?

266
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,383
OOH.

267
00:11:52,417 --> 00:11:53,383

00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:06,850
 THAT ONE.

271
00:12:06,883 --> 00:12:08,450
 THAT ONE.

272
00:12:08,483 --> 00:12:10,450
 BECAUSE OF THE STONE.

273
00:12:15,383 --> 00:12:16,650
OH.

274
00:12:16,683 --> 00:12:17,650
THE PUDDLE

275
00:12:17,683 --> 00:12:19,183
WITH THE SMALLEST STONE

276
00:12:19,217 --> 00:12:20,450
HAD THE MOST WATER.

277
00:12:20,483 --> 00:12:21,450
WELL, THAT'S

278
00:12:21,483 --> 00:12:22,683

279
00:12:22,717 --> 00:12:25,183

00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:43,950
Girl:
WE LIKE TO SEE
THE ANIMALS GROW.

309
00:13:43,983 --> 00:13:48,017
THE BABY COW'S GOING TO GROW
HORNS WHEN HE GETS BIG

310
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:49,750
LIKE HIS MOMMY.

311
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:57,417
THIS IS A BABY LAMB.

312
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:02,783
THE LITTLE PIGGY
NEEDS FOOD.

313
00:14:02,817 --> 00:14:04,950
HE'S GOING TO BE THIS BIG.

314
00:14:08,617 --> 00:14:10,917
Kid:
BABY DUCKS ARE GROWING, TOO.

315
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,317

00:14:25,717 --> 00:14:28,350
THAT'S PRETTY EXCITING,
DON'T YOU THINK?

321
00:14:28,383 --> 00:14:30,483
HEY, WE STILL HAVE TO FIGURE OUT

322
00:14:30,517 --> 00:14:32,817

00:15:09,383 --> 00:15:11,383
WELL, WE'RE TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT

338
00:15:11,417 --> 00:15:13,783
WHERE OUR FRUITS

339
00:15:13,817 --> 00:15:14,950
OH.

00:15:14,983 --> 00:15:17,350

00:15:25,217 --> 00:15:26,983
OKAY, WHERE DO
ORANGES GROW?

CAN YOU SHOW US?

344
00:15:33,317 --> 00:15:35,883
OH... OH, CAN YOU
HELP THE FELT FRIENDS?

345
00:15:35,917 --> 00:15:38,283
CAN YOU SHOW THEM
WHERE ORANGES GROW?

346
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,150
 TREES.

347
00:15:50,017 --> 00:15:51,883
HEY, WOULD YOU
LOOK AT THAT!

348
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:53,217
WE KNEW THAT.

349
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,983
FROM MR. SALT
AND MRS. PEPPER,
REMEMBER?

350
00:15:56,017 --> 00:15:57,983
Both:
YEAH!

351
00:15:58,017 --> 00:16:00,983
ORANGES GROW ON TREES.

352
00:16:01,017 --> 00:16:02,350
OKAY, HOW
ABOUT THIS?

353
00:16:03,783 --> 00:16:06,417
YEAH, WHERE DO
POTATOES GROW?

354
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:11,617
WHERE DO
POTATOES GROW?

355
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,250
CAN YOU SHOW ME?

356
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,550
 IN THE GROUND!

357
00:16:23,217 --> 00:16:26,750
OH, POTATOES GROW
UNDERGROUND.

358
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:30,683
THAT'S WHY THEY ALWAYS
HAVE DIRT ON THEM.

359
00:16:31,717 --> 00:16:33,917
Both:
UNDERGROUND, WOW!

360
00:16:35,217 --> 00:16:36,683
HEY, LOOK

361
00:16:36,717 --> 00:16:38,917

00:16:46,183 --> 00:16:48,150
DO YOU SEE WHERE
GRAPES GROW?

364
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:51,350
 ON VINES.

365
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:58,217
THE VINE!

366
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,383
GOOD JOB.

367
00:17:00,517 --> 00:17:04,250

00:19:28,683 --> 00:19:31,050
SO, WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

425
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,883
WHAT BLUE WANTS
TO DO OUTSIDE TODAY.

426
00:19:33,917 --> 00:19:35,383
AND OUR CLUES ARE:

427
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:41,483
DIRT...

428
00:19:41,517 --> 00:19:44,983
A WATERING CAN...

429
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:49,150
AND... OH, YEAH, SEEDS.

430
00:19:49,183 --> 00:19:51,550
HMM.

431
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:55,017
DIRT, WATERING CAN, SEEDS.

432
00:19:55,050 --> 00:20:00,183
DIRT, WATERING CAN, SEEDS.

433
00:20:00,217 --> 00:20:01,183
OOH, OOH, MAYBE

434
00:20:01,217 --> 00:20:02,683
MAYBE SHE WANTS TO PUT

435
00:20:02,717 --> 00:20:05,483
THE SEEDS AND THE DIRT
IN THE WATERING CAN

436
00:20:05,517 --> 00:20:06,717
AND MIX IT ALL UP.

437
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:08,817
 NO.

438
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:11,983
MAYBE...

439
00:20:12,017 --> 00:20:13,017
NOT.

440
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:18,083
WELL, WHAT COULD BLUE DO

441
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:22,617
WITH SEEDS,
WATERING CAN AND DIRT?

442
00:20:23,517 --> 00:20:24,517

443
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:31,550
PUT THE SEEDS IN THE DIRT
AND WATER.

444
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:34,083
AND THEN SHE CAN...

445
00:20:36,317 --> 00:20:37,483
 PLANT A GARDEN.

446
00:20:37,517 --> 00:20:38,550
PLANT A GARDEN!

447
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:39,550
YES! THAT'S IT!

448
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:43,150
SHE CAN PLANT THE SEEDS
IN THE DIRT

449
00:20:43,183 --> 00:20:45,617
AND WATER THEM
WITH THE WATERING CAN.

450
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,617
THAT'LL MAKE HER GARDEN GROW.

451
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:49,850
