00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:11.633
HI, OUT THERE!

2
00:00:11,667 --> 00:00:12.800
IT'S ME, STEVE.

3
00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:15.633
HAVE YOU SEEN BLUE, MY PUPPY?

4
00:00:15,667 --> 00:00:17.133
 THERE SHE IS!

00:00:21,567 --> 00:00:26.833

00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:35.267
HI. COME ON IN.

00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:39.200
WE'RE JUST ABOUT TO GO
OUTSIDE AND... PLAY.

9
00:00:39,233 --> 00:00:41.300


10
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:42.633
HEY.

11
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:48.267
HAVE YOU GROWN...

12
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49.567
OH, YEAH. YEP.

13
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50.733
LOOK AT THAT.

14
00:00:50,767 --> 00:00:53.033
YOU DO, YOU LOOK
A LITTLE BIT TALLER.

15
00:00:53,067 --> 00:00:54.033


16
00:00:54,067 --> 00:00:55.067
BLUE.

17
00:00:56,033 --> 00:00:57.233
UH-HUH.

18
00:01:00,467 --> 00:01:02.000
THERE YOU ARE, BLUE.

19
00:01:02,033 --> 00:01:03.000


20
00:01:03,033 --> 00:01:04.000
BLUE?

21
00:01:04,033 --> 00:01:05.033


22
00:01:05,067 --> 00:01:06.300
WHAT IS SHE DOING?

23
00:01:08,933 --> 00:01:09.900
OH, HEY.

24
00:01:09,933 --> 00:01:10.900


25
00:01:10,933 --> 00:01:11.900
HEY.

26
00:01:11,933 --> 00:01:13.467
YOU KNOW, BLUE...

27
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16.667
YOU DO LOOK LIKE
YOU'VE GROWN, TOO.

28
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:17.667


29
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18.700
LET'S SEE.

30
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25.300
OH, YEAH.

31
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:26.300
YEP.

32
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:27.300
LOOK AT THAT.

33
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:29.333
WOW!

34
00:01:29,367 --> 00:01:31.533
YOU'VE GROWN THIS MUCH,
A WHOLE...

35
00:01:31,567 --> 00:01:32.533


36
00:01:32,567 --> 00:01:33.667
OH, YEAH, BLUE.

37
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36.033
WE WERE GOING
TO GO OUTSIDE AND PLAY.

38
00:01:36,067 --> 00:01:37.033


39
00:01:37,067 --> 00:01:39.267
WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO PLAY? BALL?

40
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40.967


41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42.167
NO?

42
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44.967
WELL, WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO DO OUTSIDE TODAY?

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46.000


44
00:01:47,767 --> 00:01:49.000
OH, OKAY.

45
00:01:49,033 --> 00:01:51.833
WE'LL PLAY "BLUE'S CLUES"
TO FIGURE IT OUT.

46
00:01:51,867 --> 00:01:53.700
I LOVE "BLUE'S CLUES."

47
00:01:55,367 --> 00:01:57.367
* WE ARE GONNA PLAY
BLUE'S CLUES *

48
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59.567

GREAT GAME, YEAH! *

49
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04.033
"BLUE'S CLUES" WILL TELL US WHAT
BLUE WANTS TO DO OUTSIDE TODAY.

50
00:02:04,067 --> 00:02:07.567
SO REMEMBER, BLUE'S PAW PRINT
WILL BE ON THE CLUES:

51
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08.600
BLUE'S CLUES.

52
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13.700
YOU, UH, YOU THOUGHT

53
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:17.367
I WAS GOING TO FORGET ABOUT
THAT PAW PRINT, DIDN'T YOU?

54
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18.367
NOPE.

55
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22.733
LET'S CLEAN IT UP WITH THIS.

56
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:29.667
JUST A LITTLE WATER
WILL CLEAN THIS RIGHT... UP.

57
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30.700


58
00:02:34,967 --> 00:02:36.300
OKAY.

59
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:38.000

83
00:03:32,733 --> 00:03:34.233
* WELL, WE SIT DOWN

84
00:03:34,267 --> 00:03:39.867
* AND THINK, THINK, THINK

85
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43.200
* 'CAUSE WHEN WE USE OUR MINDS,
TAKE A STEP AT A TIME *

86
00:03:43,233 --> 00:03:45.300
* WE CAN DO ANYTHING...

87
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47.667


88
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49.500
* THAT WE WANT TO DO.

89
00:03:51,033 --> 00:03:52.000
OKAY.

90
00:03:52,033 --> 00:03:54.700
WE'RE ALL READY TO GROW.

91
00:03:56,167 --> 00:03:57.667
I MEAN... GO.

92
00:04:00,767 --> 00:04:02.800
HMM.

93
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:05.767
WHICH WAY DID BLUE GROW?

94
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07.067
I MEAN... GO.

95
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08.733
 SHE WENT THAT WAY. 

96
00:04:08,767 --> 00:04:10.433
OH, THIS WAY.

97
00:04:10,467 --> 00:04:11.500
OKAY.

98
00:04:13,533 --> 00:04:15.633
* WE ARE LOOKING
FOR BLUE'S CLUES *

99
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:17.567
* WE ARE LOOKING
FOR BLUE'S CLUES *

100
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19.533
* WE ARE LOOKING
FOR BLUE'S CLUES *

101
00:04:19,567 --> 00:04:21.433
* I WONDER WHERE THEY ARE.

102
00:04:22,433 --> 00:04:24.567
 A CLUE, A CLUE! 

103
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:27.600
DID YOU SEE A CLUE?

104
00:04:27,633 --> 00:04:29.200
WHERE?
WHERE'S THE CLUE?

105
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:33.067
 BEHIND YOU. 

106
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34.100
OH.

107
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38.100
THE CLUE!

108
00:04:38,133 --> 00:04:40.967
YOU KNOW HOW YOU CAN
TELL IT'S A CLUE?

109
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44.033
BECAUSE IT HAS BLUE'S
PAW PRINT ON IT.

110
00:04:44,067 --> 00:04:46.333
WE JUST FOUND
OUR FIRST CLUE.

111
00:04:46,367 --> 00:04:47.533
AND IT'S DIRT!

112
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51.800
DIRT?

113
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54.600
OUR FIRST CLUE IS DIRT?

114
00:04:54,633 --> 00:04:56.467
WHAT...

115
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58.000
WELL, NOW WHAT DO WE DO?

116
00:04:58,033 --> 00:04:59.100
 NOTEBOOK! 

117
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:01.400
RIGHT, PUT IT
IN OUR HANDY-DANDY...

118
00:05:01,433 --> 00:05:03.300
NOTEBOOK.

119
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:09.667
OKAY, SO, A BIG CLUMP OF...

120
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10.700
DIRT.

121
00:05:11,867 --> 00:05:14.467
IT HAS SOME CURVY LINES
AT THE TOP.

122
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16.867
A STRAIGHT LINE ON THE BOTTOM.

123
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:23.400
AND WE HAVE OUR... DIRT.

124
00:05:26,167 --> 00:05:32.100
SO WHAT COULD BLUE WANT TO DO
OUTSIDE TODAY... WITH DIRT?

125
00:05:32,133 --> 00:05:33.100
HMM...

126
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:34.967
OH, YOU, YOU THINK WE NEED

127
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36.633
TO LOOK FOR MORE CLUES?

128
00:05:36,667 --> 00:05:37.700
YEAH, I...

129
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:39.800
Mr. Salt:
I THINK YOU GROW AND...

130
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:41.933
Mrs. Pepper:
SQUEEZE OR SOMETHING.

131
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:44.700
GROW?

132
00:05:44,733 --> 00:05:47.433
LET'S GO SEE WHAT'S GROWING ON.

133
00:05:47,467 --> 00:05:49.500
OH, I MEAN...

134
00:05:49,533 --> 00:05:52.067
I MEAN GOING ON.

135
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53.367
OH, DEAR.

136
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55.367
FIRST YOU
GROW THE...

137
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58.000
SQUEEZE
OR SOMETHING.

138
00:05:58,033 --> 00:05:59.867
HI, MR. SALT
AND MRS. PEPPER.

139
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01.200
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

140
00:06:01,233 --> 00:06:02.200
OH!

141
00:06:02,233 --> 00:06:03.300
Both:
HI, STEVE.

142
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:05.533
WE ARE TRYING
TO MAKE ORANGE JUICE.

143
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06.533
WILL YOU HELP?

144
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:07.800
WILL YOU HELP, TOO?

145
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09.100
GREAT.

146
00:06:09,133 --> 00:06:11.567
THEN WE'LL LOOK
FOR MORE BLUE'S CLUES.

147
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14.100
Both:
WHERE DOES ORANGE
JUICE COME FROM?

148
00:06:14,133 --> 00:06:15.133
WELL...

149
00:06:17,433 --> 00:06:19.733
THAT'S A
GOOD QUESTION.

150
00:06:19,767 --> 00:06:23.500
UM, WHERE DOES ORANGE
JUICE COME FROM?

151
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:26.567
WELL, IT, IT COMES
FROM ORANGES, RIGHT.

152
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30.200
AND... ORANGES
GROW ON...

153
00:06:30,233 --> 00:06:31.233
 TREES. 

154
00:06:31,267 --> 00:06:33.767
TREES. RIGHT.

155
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:40.800
AND, UH, ORANGE
TREES GROW FROM...

156
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:41.800
 SEEDS. 

157
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43.067
AH, VOILA! 

158
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46.667
Both:
ORANGE TREES GROW FROM SEEDS.

159
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51.400
OH.
A SEED IS PLANTED.

160
00:06:51,433 --> 00:06:54.800
AND THEN AN ORANGE
TREE GROWS.

161
00:06:59,367 --> 00:07:03.433
WELL... HOW DO WE
GET ORANGE JUICE?

162
00:07:03,467 --> 00:07:05.533
 PICK THE ORANGE. 

163
00:07:05,567 --> 00:07:08.600
OH, AN ORANGE GETS PICKED
FROM THE TREE.

164
00:07:12,067 --> 00:07:13.167
HUH.

165
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17.400
SO, WHERE DOES
ORANGE JUICE COME FROM?

166
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21.967
 SQUEEZE THE ORANGE. 

167
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24.267
Steve:
AN ORANGE IS SQUEEZED...

168
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26.900
AND THE JUICE IS
POURED INTO A CUP.

169
00:07:28,467 --> 00:07:29.733
WOW.

170
00:07:29,767 --> 00:07:32.633
Both:
THAT'S WHERE ORANGE
JUICE COMES FROM.

171
00:07:32,667 --> 00:07:35.500
OKAY, SO LET ME
GET THIS STRAIGHT.

172
00:07:35,533 --> 00:07:39.000
ORANGE JUICE COMES
FROM AN ORANGE TREE SEED

173
00:07:39,033 --> 00:07:40.400
THAT IS PLANTED.

174
00:07:43,467 --> 00:07:51.500
AND THEN, THE SEED GROWS
INTO A FULL-GROWN ORANGE TREE.

175
00:07:51,533 --> 00:07:56.733
AND THEN, AN ORANGE
IS PICKED FROM THE TREE.

176
00:07:56,767 --> 00:08:01.400
AND THE JUICE IS
SQUEEZED INTO A CUP.

177
00:08:01,433 --> 00:08:02.767
GOOD JOB.

178
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03.833
UH...

179
00:08:03,867 --> 00:08:04.800
YOU KNOW...

180
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:06.867
YOU CAN GET
ORANGE JUICE

181
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08.067
FROM A CARTON

182
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10.167
Both:
OUT OF THE FRIDGE!

183
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11.633


184
00:08:11,667 --> 00:08:12.933


185
00:08:12,967 --> 00:08:14.200
OH, THAT'S BLUE.

186
00:08:14,233 --> 00:08:15.267

187
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17.667
BYE, MR. SALT
AND MRS. PEPPER.

188
00:08:19,067 --> 00:08:21.600
* WE ARE LOOKING
FOR BLUE'S CLUES *

189
00:08:21,633 --> 00:08:26.200
* WE ARE LOOKING FOR
BLUE'S CLUES... *

190
00:08:26,233 --> 00:08:27.200
 A CLUE! 

191
00:08:27,233 --> 00:08:28.233
 A CLUE! 

192
00:08:28,267 --> 00:08:30.467
YEP, THE SKY IS BLUE.

193
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35.067
 NO, A CLUE! 

194
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36.067
OH, A CLUE.

195
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37.500
YOU DO SEE A CLUE.

196
00:08:37,533 --> 00:08:38.533
REALLY?

197
00:08:38,567 --> 00:08:40.067
WELL, WHERE IS IT?

198
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:46.233
WHERE'S THE CLUE?

199
00:08:46,267 --> 00:08:47.600
 RIGHT THERE. 

200
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55.133
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.

201
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:56.167
I...

202
00:09:00,267 --> 00:09:01.767
THE CLUE!

203
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03.700
THE CLUE!

204
00:09:03,733 --> 00:09:08.100
IT'S, IT'S A, A,
A WATERING CAN.

205
00:09:08,133 --> 00:09:09.333
YEAH!

206
00:09:09,367 --> 00:09:14.500
WELL, THIS WATERING CAN
IS OUR SECOND CLUE.

207
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:15.700
NOW WHAT DO WE DO?

208
00:09:15,733 --> 00:09:16.700
 THE NOTEBOOK. 

209
00:09:16,733 --> 00:09:18.167
RIGHT, PUT IT IN OUR...

210
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19.600
NOTEBOOK.

211
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26.267
OKAY, SO, A WATERING CAN HAS...

212
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:30.700
HERE'S A RECTANGLE FOR THE BODY.

213
00:09:30,733 --> 00:09:32.267
THEN THE SPOUT.

214
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:37.100
OH YEAH, THE SPRINKLER ON THE
TOP THAT HAS SOME DOTS.

215
00:09:37,133 --> 00:09:39.667
AND THE HANDLE.

216
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41.033
THERE.

217
00:09:41,067 --> 00:09:43.067
A WATERING CAN.

218
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44.567
HMM.

219
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46.867
SO, WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

220
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49.600
WHAT BLUE WANTS
TO DO OUTSIDE TODAY.

221
00:09:49,633 --> 00:09:51.667
AND OUR FIRST CLUE WAS, WAS...

222
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52.667
 DIRT. 

223
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53.700
DIRT, RIGHT.

224
00:09:53,733 --> 00:09:55.567
HOW COULD I FORGET?

225
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59.100
NOW, OUR SECOND CLUE
IS A WATERING CAN.

226
00:09:59,133 --> 00:10:01.933
HMM.

227
00:10:01,967 --> 00:10:07.633
WHAT COULD BLUE WANT TO DO
WITH DIRT AND A WATERING CAN?

228
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:10.033
OOH, MAYBE, MAYBE...

229
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:12.600
MAYBE WE SHOULD LOOK
FOR ONE MORE CLUE.

230
00:10:12,633 --> 00:10:13.600
YEAH.

231
00:10:13,633 --> 00:10:15.733
I THINK THIS ONE
IS LONGER.

232
00:10:15,767 --> 00:10:16.733
DEFINITELY.

233
00:10:16,767 --> 00:10:17.767
COME ON.

234
00:10:18,767 --> 00:10:20.233
I'M NOT SURE,
SHOVEL.

235
00:10:20,267 --> 00:10:22.200
I THINK THIS
ONE IS LONGER.

236
00:10:22,233 --> 00:10:23.533
LOOK, THERE'S STEVE.

237
00:10:23,567 --> 00:10:24.733

CAN HELP.

238
00:10:24,767 --> 00:10:25.733
HEY, SHOVEL.

00:10:25,767 --> 00:10:26.733
HI, PAIL.

240
00:10:26,767 --> 00:10:27.733
HEY, BLUE.

241
00:10:27,767 --> 00:10:28.733
WHAT ARE YOU

242
00:10:28,767 --> 00:10:29.733
GUYS DOING?

243
00:10:29,767 --> 00:10:32.333
SHH!
WE'RE INVESTIGATING.

244
00:10:32,367 --> 00:10:33.333


245
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:35.200
INVAMAGESTIMIGATING?

246
00:10:35,233 --> 00:10:36.400
UH-HUH.

247
00:10:36,433 --> 00:10:39.933
WE WANT TO SEE
WHICH INCHWORM
IS LONGER.

248
00:10:39,967 --> 00:10:41.267
SWEATER-VEST MAKING?

249
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44.167

INVESTIGATING!

250
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45.167

254
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51.367
THEN WE CAN GO

255
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53.133
LOOK FOR MORE
BLUE'S CLUES.

256
00:10:53,167 --> 00:10:54.167
COME ON.

257
00:10:55,167 --> 00:10:57.100


258
00:10:57,133 --> 00:11:00.233
I THINK THIS
ONE IS LONGER.

259
00:11:00,267 --> 00:11:01.233


260
00:11:01,267 --> 00:11:03.500
HMM.

261
00:11:03,533 --> 00:11:04.500
CAN YOU TELL

262
00:11:04,533 --> 00:11:06.100
WHICH INCHWORM
IS LONGER?

263
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:07.133


264
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10.500
WHICH ONE?

265
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15.000
 THAT ONE. 

266
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20.800
SEE?

267
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:21.767
THE CURVED ONE

268
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23.067
WAS REALLY LONGER.

269
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24.067
YEAH.

270
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25.500
IT KIND OF GREW.

271
00:11:25,533 --> 00:11:29.233
HEY! NICE

272
00:11:29,267 --> 00:11:31.967

HEY, I THINK THAT PUDDLE

278
00:11:42,533 --> 00:11:43.500
NO.

279
00:11:43,533 --> 00:11:45.667
MAYBE THIS ONE HAS
MORE WATER.

280
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46.700
HEY, GUYS.

281
00:11:46,733 --> 00:11:47.967

283
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51.167
THESE PUDDLES.

WHICH ONE DO YOU THINK
HAS MORE WATER?

285
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55.533
OOH.

00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00.000
DO YOU KNOW?

289
00:12:00,033 --> 00:12:01.400


290
00:12:01,433 --> 00:12:03.800
WHICH PUDDLE
HAS MORE WATER?

291
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:04.833


292
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:10.000
 THAT ONE. 

293
00:12:10,033 --> 00:12:11.600
 THAT ONE. 

294
00:12:11,633 --> 00:12:13.600
 BECAUSE OF THE STONE. 

295
00:12:18,533 --> 00:12:19.800
OH.

296
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:20.800

00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22.333
WITH THE SMALLEST STONE

298
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:23.600
HAD THE MOST WATER.

299
00:12:23,633 --> 00:12:24.600
WELL, THAT'S

300
00:12:24,633 --> 00:12:25.833
JUST BRILLIANT

301
00:12:25,867 --> 00:12:28.333

Girl:
WE LIKE TO SEE
THE ANIMALS GROW.

00:13:47,133 --> 00:13:51.167
THE BABY COW'S GOING TO GROW
HORNS WHEN HE GETS BIG

333
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52.900
LIKE HIS MOMMY.

334
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00.567
THIS IS A BABY LAMB.

335
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05.933
THE LITTLE PIGGY
NEEDS FOOD.

336
00:14:05,967 --> 00:14:08.100

344
00:14:31,533 --> 00:14:33.633

SO, WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

465
00:19:34,233 --> 00:19:37.033
WHAT BLUE WANTS

466
00:19:37,067 --> 00:19:38.533
AND OUR CLUES ARE:

467
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44.633
DIRT...

468
00:19:44,667 --> 00:19:48.133
A WATERING CAN...

469
00:19:48,167 --> 00:19:52.300
AND... OH, YEAH, SEEDS.

470
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54.700
HMM.

471
00:19:54,733 --> 00:19:58.167
DIRT, WATERING CAN, SEEDS.

472
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:03.333
DIRT, WATERING CAN, SEEDS.

473
00:20:03,367 --> 00:20:04.333
OOH, OOH, MAYBE

474
00:20:04,367 --> 00:20:05.833
MAYBE SHE WANTS TO PUT

475
00:20:05,867 --> 00:20:08.633
THE SEEDS AND THE DIRT
IN THE WATERING CAN

476
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:09.867
AND MIX IT ALL UP.

477
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10.967


478
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11.967
 NO. 

479
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12.967


480
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15.133
MAYBE...

481
00:20:15,167 --> 00:20:16.167

482
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21.233
WELL, WHAT COULD BLUE DO

483
00:20:21,267 --> 00:20:25.767
WITH SEEDS,
WATERING CAN AND DIRT?

484
00:20:26,667 --> 00:20:27.667
HMM...

485
00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:34.700
PUT THE SEEDS IN THE DIRT
AND WATER.

486
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37.233
AND THEN SHE CAN...

487
00:20:39,467 --> 00:20:40.633
 PLANT A GARDEN. 

488
00:20:40,667 --> 00:20:41.700
PLANT A GARDEN!

489
00:20:41,733 --> 00:20:42.700

SHE CAN PLANT THE SEEDS
IN THE DIRT

492
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48.767
AND WATER THEM
WITH THE WATERING CAN.

493
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50.767
THAT'LL MAKE HER GARDEN GROW.

494
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53.000
